1,Arsenal,"Loved that from big Gabi, our Brazilian king is a bit of a troll haha The guy just pure straight hates attacking players."
2,Arsenal,"PUT IT ON A T-SHIRT

3,Arsenal,An instant classic 
4,Arsenal,Haha i love this 
5,Arsenal,New phone background 
6,Arsenal,Iconic 
7,Arsenal,"haha, i like your art style "
8,Arsenal,The guy just pure straight hates attacking players. 
9,Arsenal,"love u saka but big gabi robbed You know its great when I feel like one of Ode, Saka, Gabi, or Timber could have gotten motm"
10,Arsenal,"Odegaard the clear man of the match for me. With Gabriel second, love Saka but he was third for me in an overall amazing performance by the team.

Us, with and without Odegaard is becoming very similar to City without Rodri.

If he stays fit, we should be right up there at the end of the season for both premier league and UCL. If you ignore all the final balls he missed, then sure. Odegaard was man of the match with his 0.1 xA vs Saka’s 0.77 and 0 g/a vs Saka’s 2 g/a."
11,Arsenal,The debates are all just commercial atp 🥱 
12,Arsenal,Truly world class. Go argue with yourself in the mirror if you disagree. 
13,Arsenal,Well deserved. Special special player 
14,Arsenal,What a player he deserves to win titles and I pray it's with us 
15,Arsenal,Saka hitting the Nwaneri celebration. 
16,Arsenal,"Could've been Timber, Big Gabi or Partey. Massive performance from the boys. I fully expected a draw from this match but wow! We balled. "

18,Arsenal,"Timber for me but Saka g/a ,Saka motm is inevitable at this point just simply world class "
19,Arsenal,Anyone have the screenshot of the brief moment SAKA did the Gyökeres celebration? 
20,Arsenal,"You know its great when I feel like one of Ode, Saka, Gabi, or Timber could have gotten motm "
21,Arsenal,"If you ignore all the final balls he missed, then sure. Odegaard was man of the match with his 0.1 xA vs Saka’s 0.77 and 0 g/a vs Saka’s 2 g/a. Tell me you didn't watch the match, without telling me you didn't watch the match."
22,Arsenal,"Tell me you didn't watch the match, without telling me you didn't watch the match. Ironic. If you watched the game you’d see Odegaard didn’t play  single final ball and over hit pretty much every single one. Difference is I actually watch the game. You watch the version of the game you want to see."
23,Arsenal,Ironic. If you watched the game you’d see Odegaard didn’t play  single final ball and over hit pretty much every single one. Difference is I actually watch the game. You watch the version of the game you want to see. Odegard was a fucking stud today.
24,Arsenal,Odegard was a fucking stud today. Saka was a lot better.
25,Arsenal,Saka was a lot better. 
26,Arsenal,"I will die on the hill that Walcott’s Arsenal career is extremely under appreciated by our fans.


The British press put unrealistic expectations on him that we’ve seen so many careers destroyed by. He managed to get through those and have an elite level career. If he didn’t get that injury in 13/14 he woulda gone v far, especially with Ozil. He was never the same after that despite having his moments. Couldn’t agree more. The threat of his run behind enabled so much of the edge of the box space even Fergie called the wenger zones lol He’s probably my favorite Arsenal player in my almost 20 years of supporting this club. Most of my favorite Arsenal goals were score by him Would have been elite if he didn’t do his acl against spurs https://preview.redd.it/o1pl1tevjb3e1.jpeg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b99f22aa9c53ba3e58a7c1aa6c2bba490f2c9298"
27,Arsenal,Not bad company 
28,Arsenal,"More than an every other game stat, 123/244. Remarkable for someone that started playing for us at Left Back at 17! "
29,Arsenal,From 23yr old who started at LB. Club legend in the making 
30,Arsenal,"How many are in the 100 100 club for us? 

If he stays and stays fit for us he can easily do that Just Bergkamp I think"
31,Arsenal,dethrone the king young prince! 
32,Arsenal,"Look at the names. 2nd academy player. 

We have witnessed the birth of an icon. "
33,Arsenal,"This guy is pretty decent, might have a future at the top "
34,Arsenal,"If he didn’t get that injury in 13/14 he woulda gone v far, especially with Ozil. He was never the same after that despite having his moments. Yeah he was really flourishing that year as well, was finally becoming the player we thought he could be"

39,Arsenal,Just Bergkamp I think 
40,Arsenal,"Yeah he was really flourishing that year as well, was finally becoming the player we thought he could be That goal against Newcastle where he was fouled in the box and he just gets up and blasts it in is stuck in my mind forever"
41,Arsenal,That goal against Newcastle where he was fouled in the box and he just gets up and blasts it in is stuck in my mind forever Did a similar thing against Chelsea where he got knocked over slid on his belly got up and scored
42,Arsenal,Did a similar thing against Chelsea where he got knocked over slid on his belly got up and scored 
43,Arsenal,Timber was unreal tonight. Just gets better and better 😌 Absolutely immense He seemed quite on it offensively especially in the second half
44,Arsenal,I can't believe people thought we were bad because of reds and injuries lmaoo 
45,Arsenal,What a performance from Partey. Extend his contract asap 
46,Arsenal,We pumped in some GD too. 
47,Arsenal,This slaps harder when the two of them were involved in the goals 
48,Arsenal,Just gets better and better 😌 
49,Arsenal,Absolutely immense 
50,Arsenal,He seemed quite on it offensively especially in the second half 
51,Arsenal,What about lens 6-0 lol the post meant away from home My dumb self forgot to Add away
52,Arsenal,Is that Porto? Fenerbahce
53,Arsenal,"Can’t believe how good Nwaneri is. 

The way he runs with the ball is insane England has got some true ballers coming through in those attacking positions behind the 9."
54,Arsenal,We've really only scored 5 goals in 16 years? That's crazy. 
55,Arsenal,lol the post meant away from home 
56,Arsenal,My dumb self forgot to Add away 
57,Arsenal,Fenerbahce Ah damn it. Thought this was the nasri show game
58,Arsenal,England has got some true ballers coming through in those attacking positions behind the 9.

67,Arsenal,That's a chunky xG even before you consider we were away in the Champions League 
68,Arsenal,"Atalanta won 6-1 today, remember everyone freaking out about 0-0 away from home that's unfair, they were playing kids.

oh wait no I misread"
69,Arsenal,Only 3rd time in history we scored 5 away in UCL 
70,Arsenal,DAMN WE MAULED THEM 
71,Arsenal,Let’s halve that XGa and then we’re back 
72,Arsenal,".97 feels a little low tbh

What a performance though ?

90% of the Sporting shots were at least 20 yards out and their goal was very low xG. They had lots of low XG shots. Tbf even though lots of them were crap there were some others which were very good and gave Raya busy time, but on XG they are still considered low quality shots Nah, it feels about right. They scored from a corner, and didn't have that many chances outside of that moment of Gyökeres magic. It looked bad in the first 15 minutes of the second half because we kept losing composure on the ball, the main flaw of xG is that it can't measure the feel of the game."

78,Arsenal,I mean tbf Gyokeres is nowhere to be seen Physically dominated by Gabi XL and Willi He's had a couple attempted passes but really no support at all. We can fix him :). I'm just waiting for the 4-4-toons rendition of this Haha!
79,Arsenal,"This is his celebration being mocked. Not copied. We back. Dark arts is back. Fuck yo salahs and haalands. We got Gabi.  Exactly this. GXL is taking the piss. How are people thinking it's being copied? Lol Our Centre Back Forward! bbb-but how are we supposed to buy Gyokeres, now?  😢 Turn the 6 upside down…"
80,Arsenal,"It’s the opposite, over the eyes instead of the mouth, even more of a slap He’s trolling him like *where you at? Can’t see you* Yes Captain obvious 😂"
81,Arsenal,Only playing teams once in the group stage really allows for more shithousery. Goddamn we need White back for shithousery

83,Arsenal,"Gabi's cele is cold af 🥶 Couldn't believe it, doing it at the Alvadade takes balls but wouldn't expect anything less from Gabriel"
84,Arsenal,Yeah he’s going to Spurs now Don't care. Don't want him here.
85,Arsenal,Gyokeres to Arsenal confirmed by Gabi XL himself. Or Gabi just called off the transfer himself lol
86,Arsenal,Can't wait for him to dunk on city at the Emirates and celebrate by doing haalands meditation celebration but on his head instead 
87,Arsenal,Why did you do it maaan…. Dont gass me upppp 
88,Arsenal,"Poses the question: Which is the biggest piss take, copying an opposing player's celebration accurately, or doing it completely wrongly? By purposely doing it like this its leaving no debate he’s meaning it as a piss take I was thinking the same thing, first i thought: that is disrespectful... the i notice that he did it wrong... was it worse?"
89,Arsenal,Fucking legend 
90,Arsenal,"Me: Mom, can we have Gyokeres?

Mom: We have Gyokeres at home

The Gyokeres at home: "
91,Arsenal,Nah he is taking the piss 😭 
92,Arsenal,Oh yes he fucking did 
93,Arsenal,"Beat me to it 😅 (I have few karma)

Total shutdown of them, Ødegaard effect affects the whole pitch, allows Calafiori and Timber more advanced positions closer to their marks on possible turnovers. "
94,Arsenal,"“I’ll score for you this game because you won’t”

-Gabby to Gyokeres before the game probably "
95,Arsenal,Brother we want him here dont make him hate us lmka 
96,Arsenal,Rice corner/Gabi header feels like having a cheat code playing FIFA on the PlayStation. 
97,Arsenal,So happy. Only last week I was saying Havertz better than gyokeres n everyone downvoted me. 
98,Arsenal,🥶 🥶

103,Arsenal,New profile picture

116,Arsenal,Damn... That's cold! 
117,Arsenal,Gykores' best moment came when he got a lot of space. Big surprise 🥱 
118,Arsenal,GOAT shit 
119,Arsenal,"*""Ain't no other king in this goal thing, they siblings*

*Nothing but my children, 1 shot- they disappearing""*

120,Arsenal,I trust this sub will now put to rest the idea of getting Gyokores in the January window.

123,Arsenal,"Gyökeres might like this behaviour, please bring him here ARSENAL. "
124,Arsenal,"haha, ruthless "
125,Arsenal,Hahahahhah 
126,Arsenal,And then we go and concede a goal to start the 2nd. Karma… 
127,Arsenal,"Physically dominated by Gabi XL and Willi I've said it for ages: Gyokeres only works when he is stronger and faster than the opposition CBs.  That's why he's so effective in Portugal, and it's also why he's not suited to the Prem or late stage CL.  Throw an equal at him, and he consistently vanishes.

Of course, now that I've said this, he will now go on to a hat trick.  I apologize to my irate future readers"
128,Arsenal,He's had a couple attempted passes but really no support at all. We can fix him :). 
129,Arsenal,I'm just waiting for the 4-4-toons rendition of this I bet it's hilarious /s

Of course, now that I've said this, he will now go on to a hat trick.  I apologize to my irate future readers Isn’t this literally every striker? Even Haaland has been shut down pretty regularly by Saliba and Gabi. He’s also not as good in late stage CL as he is in regular league play. That’s just how it works, the tougher the competition gets, and the tougher the center back pairing, the more difficult it will be to score goals against them. It doesn’t mean they won’t still score sometimes but their goals per game will be lower against better competition and that’s what you’d expect out of anyone. I don’t know enough about Gyokeres to say whether or not he’d improve Arsenal but “not being as good against tougher competition as he is against easier competition” isn’t exactly where I’d draw the line for any player. Judge any striker based on how they play against saliba & gabi and you’d find out they all stink lmao What can he do this game? We have completely destroyed them midfield he has barely gotten the ball. I dont think we can judge how good he is when literally every Arsenal player is better than every Sporting player Tbf Gabi is one of the best cbs in the world no matter how good Gyokeres is gabi will pocket anyone nah, he was good in second half and hit the woodwork I kept saying the same. He needs space. But yeah everyone is blinded by his goal scoring in Portugal. He is not what we need!

He isn't scoring shit bro."

So we need 2 wins from 3 games. Shouldn't be a Herculean task. 2 home wins so"

203,Arsenal,Thats a beautiful cross 
204,Arsenal,"Manhandled him and stole his cele, peak disrespect "
205,Arsenal,"That might be one of the best flighted corner kicks I've ever seen.

The swerve, speed and placement was really spectacular, you just knew there would be a Gabby head behind it. "

218,Arsenal,"I think technically Big Gabi covered his eyes, so Batman to Gyokeres’ Bane. But yeah, petty gangster. Not sure if he thought about all that, but kinda makes sense haha"
219,Arsenal,"Not sure if he thought about all that, but kinda makes sense haha "
220,Arsenal,https://i.redd.it/gthpbwezcb3e1.gif 
221,Arsenal,Just an unbelievable pen 
222,Arsenal,That's how all our penalty's should be. 
223,Arsenal,Amazing pen. How does Diomande stay on the pitch after that though? 
224,Arsenal,"This Timber performance has been absolutely nuts lol, how many times has he just glided past someone they cannot touch him Just fucking everywhere innit"
225,Arsenal,TIMBER TIMBER TIMBER 
226,Arsenal,"He probably needed that with his average recent form

Good night all in all "
227,Arsenal,We’re so back  
228,Arsenal,Everyone's eating 
229,Arsenal,Cold 
230,Arsenal,Raya would have saved that 
231,Arsenal,BOSSARDDDDD 
232,Arsenal,We need to have an adult conversation about Rice as LCM. 
233,Arsenal,Just fucking everywhere innit 
234,Arsenal,I think the 6s for Merino are a little harsh 
235,Arsenal,Timber my MOTM was absolutely outstanding in every phase

238,Arsenal,"omg someone gave Timber a 5

Now tbc there is no 6, so Timber 5, no 6, then a couple of 7s smh

Nice to see Saka leading the MOTM from a excellent all round team performance. "

240,Arsenal,I wanted to put Saka but Ø was class today. We could have scored more if we managed to finish better. I thought Partey was excellent also. Great work from the team 
241,Arsenal,"A lot of excellent performances tonight, but wanted to shout out Timber - what a beast of a player he is. Really makes ya think what last season could've been if we had him fit and firing He stood out to me as well. His press resistance and technical ability is great, he looks so calm under pressure and in tight spaces. Him Odegaard and Saka triangles are crazy. Benny Blanco has some cause for concern. Him and Calafiori as wingbacks has been transformative. He was phenomenal. Guy’s under-appreciated i believe. He’s everywhere, doesn’t look like someone who’s ruptured his ACL🤷 If we had him for a few games, it would've been enough I'm so glad to finally have him at RB. I was hyping this up even when he was looking good at LB and he looks even better on his natural side. Dude is special. LB was such a problematic position for us last season. We would've definitely gotten some more points if he was fit. Timber has been fantastic at RB in White's absence."
242,Arsenal,"THAT was the team that smacked City about?

https://preview.redd.it/0ktej3oihb3e1.jpeg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0907c89005b9903c947c1d9b38230b65404c387 One of them, yeah. City is just not that good without Rodri Judging by their defending tonight Hereford could smack them around a bit"
243,Arsenal,Sporting hadn’t lost this season before tonight. What a team we are Battered them more than man city were battered by them! Hadn't lost at home since last year as well.
244,Arsenal,"Best performance of the season by far. Just zero complaints. Your performance in calling Martinelli to open the scoring wasn't too shabby either. The prophet has spoken, his word is law Absolute battering.. finally the season is firmly back on track We genuinely absolutely smashed them, and they weren't even that bad. Just carved them open when we wanted to. Can you say that arsenal are going to win the league and Champs next oh sweet sweet oracle 1 complaint - That was a cheap goal to give away. Clean sheet would have been the cherry on top. I'm sure Arteta and team will discuss it. But an amazing performance overall. Partey was absolutely bossed that midfield. Best player on the pitch my some distance Apart from that wobble just after the start of second half it was perfect imo. Could argue you’ll always get that against another class team like Sporting"
245,Arsenal,"Remember though, Arteta “can’t coach an attack” Remember though, Mikel is insane for rolling out a midfield trio that has never lost a game for us  Also the return of Martin 'not a final third player/just a final third Elneny/not teh rael catpain' Ødegaard will in no way help our creativity."
246,Arsenal,"Best performance in Europe under Arteta imo. Also lets laugh at city I think that’s why the sub isn’t that active rn, everyone tuned in to the city game after our 5th goal"
247,Arsenal,Did the lads take a secret trip to Dubai during the international break? Mikel organised a fancy dress 'Dubai Night'. The real Dubai was the goals we scored along the way
248,Arsenal,"Partey was really good Yet again. He's been one of our most consistent players this season, hardly put a foot wrong"
249,Arsenal,"Feels good to see us actually play good football again. These couple of results can really turn our season around. Masterclass performance from big Gabi and Saliba, had one of the most lethal strikers in Europe on toast. Odegaard is just too important for us, cannot afford to lose him. Genuinely felt bad for Gyökeres out there lmao. Dude would manage to buy some space only for one of the big two to just envelope the poor dude and take it away. 


Glad he at least got a moment against Kiwior lmao."
250,Arsenal,that ball by saka and control by trossard at the end was scrumptious. 
251,Arsenal,"Arteta Outers, where you at? Oh they'll be back. They always come scurrying back the moment we get a bad result If you mean, people ”Coming Out for Arteta”? ☝🏼 Absolute morons the lot of em"
252,Arsenal,What a fucking performance! 
253,Arsenal,"1. Best game of the season.
2. Saliba deservedly gets a tonne of praise, but Gabriel’s even better against big strikers. He goddamn bullies them! But ofc the real value is in the godly pairing.
3. Without Odegaard, Saka is brilliant; with him around, Saka’s fucking unplayable!
4. I hope he’s not at the club next season, but god damn it, Partey’s a brilliant midfielder when fit!
5. We won 5-1 in a fixture Man City lost 4-1 🤯 "
254,Arsenal,"Best match all season.

Ødegaard, Saka and Timber all COOKED

Nwaneri is just getting better and better each game. Immediate impact as soon as he got on the pitch

ALSO Man City is FUCKED. 6 winless. It’s so beautiful 🥹. Can’t believe they actually pulled a Tottenham against the fourth place team in Eredivisie

Premier League wise, it’s between us, Liverpool and possibly Chelsea. "
255,Arsenal,Absolutely dogwalked that side. Feels good man. 
256,Arsenal,More than anything that has helped us so much with goal difference. Managed to jump above Sporting in the table after today 
257,Arsenal,"Jurrien Timber is fucking incredible lol.
Also, Odegaard ran the show in the first half we look like a completely different team with him. "
258,Arsenal,"It won’t get mentioned but Raya had a low-key blinder. 8 saves is no jokes It should get mentioned, of course, but he's so consistently good that I think some are becoming blind to it. Yeah, this game was a sweep but Raya turning up is what stopped it from being a close one. That and Sporting players shooting with anger instead of precision."
259,Arsenal,Raya is the GOAT. Unreal saves today. Thrilled with that signing 
260,Arsenal,Well that was comprehensive. 
261,Arsenal,Gyokeres wants to play for Arsenal 
262,Arsenal,Gyokeres is a good player. 
263,Arsenal,That Nwaneri attempt in the 90th would’ve hit like crack 
264,Arsenal,Won't get talked about because of the score. But Raya was insane today. Sporting had as many shots on target as we did. Pulled off some amazing saves. Second in my MotM ratings behind Odegaard. 
265,Arsenal,"I don't think we should understate what a great result this was. Sporting are THE in form team in  Europe based on their actual performances. This is no Mickey Mouse outfit. It's still Amorims team. Him being there would have made no difference. We were that good.

Hope Big Gabi is alright. City are going to get thrashed at Anfield so it's up to us to put pressure on Liverpool. If we play like this they'll be looking over their shoulder every week. "
266,Arsenal,https://preview.redd.it/g87ihivwib3e1.jpeg?width=1005&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72bebbc3add291034f06e1689b49430994b635a8 
267,Arsenal,"![gif](giphy|cm0GRfnWDVaa6SMJ6N)

Gabriel : "
268,Arsenal,Guess Winning CL away against Sporting CP aint for anyone 
269,Arsenal,Odegaard appreciation button! 
270,Arsenal,Arteta really answered a lot of questions about our European away performances under him. 5-1 bollocking and hell it could have been more. We were in 2nd gear the last 25 mins and still created great chances 
271,Arsenal,"timber was such a unit. my favorite player in this match. man was everywhere. the physical strength, intelligent decision making, technical quality and defensive ability all in one. truly amazing today, wouldnt be surprised if uefa named him motm. so much to discuss about the match, lots of positives and few negatives. "
272,Arsenal,Always important to stay humble 
273,Arsenal,"Crazy. Almost as if the media couldn’t comprehend we weren’t playing well because of BS red cards and our captain was out. 

Nope. I guess we’re just mourinho regen. Captain and half the defence"
274,Arsenal,"1. Outside the first 10 minutes of the second half, utter domination. 

2. Even so, Gyokeres gave a good impression. He did not score, but he has good strength, decent pace, and good on both on and off the ball. I don't know if he will move in January, but his agent will be busy. 

3. Ball movements were outstanding, both long and short. 

4. Rice still seems like a bit off the fitness. I have never seen him all sweaty and redfaced that early in the game. Hope he gets better soon. 

5. Good win with good GD earned. I am going to focus on my own college football hate week. 

6. To all who serve, happy Thanksgiving! "
275,Arsenal,Bring the ref to the PL. The decisions have all been on point 
276,Arsenal,The cherry on top Haaland is still being humbled 😂 
277,Arsenal,"How many points do you need to qualify? We’re getting 19, that will be enough"
278,Arsenal,These past two matches have been the palate cleanser I needed. 
279,Arsenal,Let's fucking go!! Unbeaten run starts now. Great game and good to see trossard get his goal. Should help with his confidence. 
280,Arsenal,Jurrien Timber was so damn good in this game. His body feints and ball carrying was insane. 
281,Arsenal,Martin Ødegaard makes the world a better place and Bukayo is top 3 best players in the world rn fight me if you disagree 
282,Arsenal,lmao city 
283,Arsenal,"Thought it was interesting how we opened the second half. I don't think we were playing badly. The whole first 15 minutes of the half look almost deliberate?   
  
We reverted to a tight 424 in a low block, almost expecting Sporting to come out firing. Our job was to tire them out and we did it almost flawlessly besides a corner goal. Everything else was semi-speculative shooting from a distance. "
284,Arsenal,"“stay humble, eh” "
285,Arsenal,Guys guys stay humble 3-3 😂 
286,Arsenal,"Nwaneri has the sauce.

Came on and looked immediately to run at the defenders which I think shocked them a tad.

Ode was more passive and looking to pass around them but Ethan charged right in and got loads of space which I think took the defence off guard "
287,Arsenal,"Joint biggest win in the champions league Away win, I think. We have torched a Sparta Prague somewhere."
288,Arsenal,"Have questioned Arteta’s preparation for European away matches regularly but this was about as comprehensive a first half performance in a long time, lovely to see "
289,Arsenal,"Unpopular opinion after a dominant win, but… Calafiori has been so meh/lukewarm so far. Shaky defensively with most threats coming from spaces he created or errors he committed. Doesn’t really invert, doesn’t effectively overlap either, little progression through carries or line-cutting passing. He hasn’t had major blunders yet, fwiw. 

Maybe there will be some major/decisive moment when his defensive chops will shine, but so far, I really find him unconvincing and unimpressive (his looks notwithstanding). 

This is made especially clear with timber just killing it on the right, and with what Zinchenko has shown after he came on today. ![gif](giphy|ac7MA7r5IMYda) Very valid take I want to give him a stretch of games, 
but yeh he’s not looked as comfortable at LB as he does LCB could just be teething issues seeing as he’s just recovered and is getting more used to his role but so far looked very Average to say the least Zinchenko's passing in the 15 mins was so far superior to anything calafiori did. FWIW I agree.  He’s good but he kinda reminds me of first year Gabi where he was a bit careless/sloppy.  He needs time but I’m infinitely more confident in him with a torn ACL over zinchenko with the super soldier serum"
290,Arsenal,We are so back 
291,Arsenal,Brilliant performance hoping this sets the bar for the boys going forward 
292,Arsenal,We want City 
293,Arsenal,Arsenal looked alive. Sporting hit for five. Gyökeres Yokerfied. Job done innit. 
294,Arsenal,We have never been more back. 
295,Arsenal,MOTM Bukayo 
296,Arsenal,"Excellent result, excellent performance. So, so good to have Odegaard back. "
297,Arsenal,"big boss win, imma sleep now "
298,Arsenal,That was very fun. Total control. Arteta what a manager my word. 
299,Arsenal,"great performance all around, proud coyg. just began to hatewatch, wtf is wrong with city "
300,Arsenal,"Lads, we are eating GOOD tonight "
301,Arsenal,Timber was world class and Saka showing he’s one of the best players in the world 
302,Arsenal,"That was an elite ucl away performance. Had everything. Solid goals, solid defense, tempo and intent. On to the next one.  COYG 

VAMOSSSSS "
303,Arsenal,"Great win! We're looking really good. We go on a monster winning run now, please? "
304,Arsenal,It’s been a while since we’ve had such a gratifying European night like that. Cheers Feyenoord 
305,Arsenal,"10/10 from everyone. Saka MoTM. 
Gyo come to join us. "
306,Arsenal,Timber my motm today. Saka inevitable 
307,Arsenal,"people saying rice-partey-odegaard isnt our best midfield, where are you lot now "
308,Arsenal,City did snap their 5 game losing streak. But in a hilariously bad way 
309,Arsenal,"Statement win.

Everything just worked today. Got in. Got out. No injuries. 

Would have liked to see KT get some time. Guess that’s my complaint. "
310,Arsenal,Happy with us hitting our stride a couple months early. Let’s do it.  
311,Arsenal,Stay humble eh 
312,Arsenal,PSG started in 25th and are about to lose 
313,Arsenal,Really excellent result for us. It's these types of performances that can be the kickstarter for a big run. Fingers crossed for that. City are in their most shambolic run since the takeover. Liverpool will destroy them if they defend like that and don't get their act together. 
314,Arsenal,"First half - flawless, emphatic Arsenal. Second half - gave them a taste of hope, then gradually drained them of it. An excellent squad performance. This is what we've been waiting for. COYG!!! "
315,Arsenal,"Mostly impressed by Quenta. Non of our players could get passed him. 

Also Havertz need Zinchenko to have someone to pass him the ball 😭 Quenta was at fault for our first goal lol"
316,Arsenal,Ødegaard 
317,Arsenal,"World class performance and also good results for us btw 

City dropping to 8 points in a must win 
Sporting was a 6 pointer for us 
Brest lost too "
318,Arsenal,Partey is the unsung hero today. It sucks that he can't get the praise he deserves. 
319,Arsenal,"Complete team performance, don't see that from the PGMOL clowns, no low points for the ref or VAR in the poll



Arsenal were perfect too, brilliant performance from all, no slag off targets tonight.

# COYG! "
320,Arsenal,A really good away performance in Europe. Finally 
321,Arsenal,"An emphatic win, we definitely needed a statement win like this away from home in Europe, this is a team to be reckoned with, and we're only just getting started; now that most of our squad has returned from injuries. "
322,Arsenal,"Great Champions League performance from the boys, a lot of the other players will get most of the praise but I thought Timber was excellent today. Was he playing DM at the end of the game there or just inverting?"
323,Arsenal,"Immense all round. Raya? Immense. Gabi and Saliba? Immense. Saka and Ode?? Immense. 
Anyone I didn't mention by name but wears red? Immense too. 

Looking to put our injury woes behind us, I reckon we might go on a run now. This performance inspires great confidence. "
324,Arsenal,so glad we got to rest odegaards legs a little! nwaneri is comin for that ucl goal! 
325,Arsenal,"Very nice performance from us.

On a side note: Gyokeres was good in the second half given the circumstances and has one hell of a shot on him. Credit to our back line for keeping him as quiet as possible "
326,Arsenal,"Arsenal with an emphatic comprehensive away victory and City with a monumental collapse at home.

Inject it into my veins. "
327,Arsenal,Humbling performance all things and other results considered 
328,Arsenal,"Sensational game by Timber. Best game I've seen of him with the shirt. That was Man City charity shield for me, but he did well today "
329,Arsenal,"First half - as good as I’ve seen under Arteta. 
Overall - best away CL display since San Siro 2008 "
330,Arsenal,"After God knows how long, a good away performance in Europe "
331,Arsenal,imagine if we never got decimated by injuries and refball to start the season...that fucked up our momentum and it finally feels like we are starting to gel finally 
332,Arsenal,"Just beautiful. That Saka, Ødegaard, Timber right hand side has absolutely served these past 2 games. We showed up, in a UCL away game, and bossed them in their own backyard, especially in the first half. I used to pray for days like this.

https://preview.redd.it/7z72r6oyib3e1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d79aca3b398ef0272d60cb5dd88edd559d6bdbd "
333,Arsenal,What a game. So many great performances all over the pitch. Another supposedly world class striker in Salibas pocket. He must have very deep pockets to fit them all in. I could go on but no one would read that much. Im one happy gooner. 
334,Arsenal,"Gyokeres should join us next summer so that he does not have to face our center backs again. Also, I love Odegaard so fucking much. "
335,Arsenal,Vintage 
336,Arsenal,"Good performance wasn't happy about the first 15 minutes of the second half.

Lets focus on West Ham United Onwards"
337,Arsenal,All I have to say is don’t let Gyokeres’ quiet night change your perception of him.. our CBs have a knack for making world class strikers look like league 2 players 😎 
338,Arsenal,What a pleasure to watch this game 
339,Arsenal,"That first half was really fucking good, away in europe too. Lost a bit control in the second half but overall very good performance. Feels like we are getting back to our best again. We move! "
340,Arsenal,Great performance against the leading team in Portugal on a 11-game winning run. Need to build on this and win the next four or five games to put some pressure on the Pool. Coyg 
341,Arsenal,"That might be the best half of football I've seen us play away in Europe in a long time PSG was fun as well, but ya that was at home.. our dominance was so absolute that we could easily be up 5 goals I'm not taking the ""Amorim just left"" bs seriously, that's still his team, his formation, his set-up. We're just thrashing them I think ever, for me."
342,Arsenal,"Might be our best half of the season Without a doubt Crazy how we said that against forest on Saturday and now we're saying it again.

Team has been outstanding with odegaard back We're so back, football is fun to watch again, fantastic play there"
343,Arsenal,"TNT commentary were saying how easy it was for us, but that's not easy.  That's complete dominance.  They started fine but we broke them.

Shoutout our entire right side, I'm in disbelief at the ability on display. Best Timber 45 minutes for us so far imo, obviously imperious off the ball but he’s getting back to his best again on the ball and looks so confident, just glides past people  Nah TNT are right. sporting have looked dreadful.

They haven’t even pressed us"
344,Arsenal,He wont get the credit until we win the cl or pl but Odegaard is simply one of the best player currently in the world He and Rodri are 1A and 1B if people take their G/A blinkers off But but but... bRuNo FeRnAnDeS iS cLeAR
345,Arsenal,Our pressing is different gravy when Ode is on the field This. It’s disappointing that it wasn’t just his creative play that was missing. No one stepped up to fill the leadership void when he was out
346,Arsenal,"The scoreline is fantastic obviously but holy fuck man I’m just enjoying watching us play again. 

Every time we go forward we look threatening. People are breaking the lines looking for runs, you don’t know which way Saka is gonna go. You don’t know if Partey will shoot from outside the box or Rice will make a good run into it, Califiori and Timber offer threat from the wings. It’s just unpredictable and so hard to play against. THIS is what makes a good attacking team. 

Beautiful, just beautiful. Odegaard is the key - the opposition are frightened to press him as he can easily go past them and they have no idea what pass he's gonna make as he can find literally anyone with his passing."
347,Arsenal,Odegaard please never get injured again he is massive for us.
348,Arsenal,Odegaard you’ve changed my life 
349,Arsenal,"Odegaard, Saka, Timer and Partey doing unspeakable things on that side People will give Ode and Saka the plaudits and deservedly so, but omfg Timber was so fucking clean Sporting is getting absofuckinglutely run ragged on that side."
350,Arsenal,"This Morita character feels like he’s liable to two foot someone very soon lol

Our best 45 minutes of football since putting 4 past Chelsea, lovely stuff I figure it's Diomande. Every shot is him looking increasingly frustrated."
351,Arsenal,https://preview.redd.it/wuiomech8b3e1.jpeg?width=1005&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6319d1551e575287e010132ca2387e94ddbb76c5 
352,Arsenal,"Don't think we've dominated an area of the pitch this season as much as we did that right hand attacking side so far, my god - Timber/Ode/Saka were serving up nightmares "
353,Arsenal,"We have pulled their pants down, custard pied them in the face, then shoved them in the back so they trip over ther pants around their ankles.

Absolute mauling. i wld love to hear Peter Drury narrate this"
354,Arsenal,best performance away in europe in years so far 
355,Arsenal,I cant emphasize how much we need Ode to stay healthy 
356,Arsenal,"Smart of Gabriel and Saliba to tank Gyokeres's value to get us a deal during Jan. In all seriousness, what a first half performance, Odegaard been insane. The movement around the midfield is so good too. Always seem to have an open man. I was a bit worried we were sitting back at 1-0 but came out and controlled the game. "
357,Arsenal,Gabi mocking the Gyokeres' celebration is a great way to end the half. And a bad way to begin his contract negotiations 😅
358,Arsenal,So we get 50% off on Gyokeres right? 
359,Arsenal,"no goals, no assist, but my fking life man, martin is just on another level man, the guy is 1 of 1, one of those players that make football the game we all love, truly special "
360,Arsenal,I think it’s half time 
361,Arsenal,"1. We’re actually fun to watch!
2. Our best half this season. 
3. Odegaard and Saka are of course wizards, but god damn that bastard number 5 is a brilliant fucking player when fit.
4. Gabriel lives for manhandling the biggest striking monsters in the world, and then goes the other end and shows them how their job is done haha 
5. We could be 5-0 up! "
362,Arsenal,Champagne football 
363,Arsenal,It turns out that we're really good when the captain is fit. 
364,Arsenal,Look at what injuries and dumb referees have made us miss! 
365,Arsenal,Rice should come off at half. Good shift but you can tell his toe is bothering him. 
366,Arsenal,We winning it all. Also big Gabi has taken the reigns as team shithouse now that Ben is out for time. 
367,Arsenal,We are so back! Odegaard is back We are back baby !
368,Arsenal,We're so back 
369,Arsenal,If I ever have a son he's name is gonna be Martin Bukartin for me.
370,Arsenal,Monstrous game from Big Gabi so far. 
371,Arsenal,Who knew you could enjoy two football matches in a row. 
372,Arsenal,We're fucking good. 
373,Arsenal,That Ode-Partey midfield is absolutely elite today.. 
374,Arsenal,"Partey has been on smoke since day 1 this season. Incredible performance from. Ode and Saka looking incredible with the link up, Kai being an absolute terrorist in between the CBs. Beautiful shit lads. "
375,Arsenal,Best half we’ve played all season if you ask me. 
376,Arsenal,"https://preview.redd.it/fvwtndkr6b3e1.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=f872c636970f1cc6012405a734deed4187e86534

😂😂😂😂😂😂 "
377,Arsenal,This game is reminding me why I love watching arsenal so much 
378,Arsenal,I would like to see the baby 
379,Arsenal,"Where’s that guy who hates on Odegaard? Noncething is on twitter, but he has a few silly little emissaries here."
380,Arsenal,"I feel like we’re, ya know, pretty decent "
381,Arsenal,"Gabi & Saliba have pocketed Haaland many times, no surprise they’re locking Gyokeres down.

This is the first time I’ve seen Sporting all year and I wanted to see what Gyokeres hype was about. 

Guess we’ll have to wait lol. Exactly what I’ve been saying on another thread"
382,Arsenal,No injuries/ red cards please 
383,Arsenal,"sporting are maybe the most in-form side in europe and weve just shown them levels - when we play like this we are at minimum a top 3 side itw.

loved martinelli doing the havertz celebration and gabi xl doing the gyokeres celebration "
384,Arsenal,Shout out to that one guy in the match tread that called a Gabriel header 
385,Arsenal,10/10 half. Captain is cooking with extra sauce tonight! 
386,Arsenal,Jesus christ we are good today 
387,Arsenal,If we played like this every game…life would be too good. 
388,Arsenal,"Our best half this season, everything is so high quality in our play Quite literally 45 minutes of dominance. Defensively and offensively."
389,Arsenal,Bring on the baby ![gif](giphy|kCpg2FYkENfnuvXSsS)
390,Arsenal,Big Gabi bane mask celly hit like crack It was the Gyokeres celebration.
391,Arsenal,I love Mr Ø 
392,Arsenal,We’ve got our arsenal back lads 
393,Arsenal,Is a Gabriel x Ødegaard joint MOTM possible Only if you add Timber as well
394,Arsenal,"Honestly Saka is unbelievable but I refuse to believe we drop off as hard without him as a we do ode. Very glad we’ve not had to live through it since he’s been in the squad. 

Honestly guys with the fixtures turn positive for us and negative for our rivals I have such a good feeling we can get in a run and close the distance relatively quickly I still really don't see how Liverpool will drop points. The only other anchor which is City have been shit. And we've already played Liverpool and sadly didn't beat them"
395,Arsenal,"There's back, so back, a long stretch of of pure joy, and then there's what we are now. "
396,Arsenal,"Liquidate the club, sack Arteta, sell Nelli etc. "
397,Arsenal,this gyokeres fella looks average He would cook for us tho Tbf he's barely had a sniff really. We've really dominated the match There’s not many strikers who don’t look average against Saliba and Gabriel tbf
398,Arsenal,Our captain is very good 
399,Arsenal,What a half. Beautiful. Inject it 
400,Arsenal,We are fucking GOOD. 
401,Arsenal,"Big Gabi can shag my wife.

I just need to find a wife first. "
402,Arsenal,Best half since the inception of arsenal FC 
403,Arsenal,"I like it, more please "
404,Arsenal,We are so fucking back 
405,Arsenal,Just a beautiful half of football from us 
406,Arsenal,I want to to see the Tesco bag and the baby! 
407,Arsenal,Great first half now let’s keep a clean sheet.. 
408,Arsenal,Odegaard was missed. We look complete 
409,Arsenal,Odegaard has gone up a level. 
410,Arsenal,Release the 17 yr old 
411,Arsenal,This team is MUSTARRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDD 
412,Arsenal,"Rice ode & Saka off please
Save their legs We need to save timber more than any of those guys lol. Those 3 will likely be okay until around 70-80 Just say it.. You want to see the kid After 65min sure and if we're up Add calafiori and timber to that"
413,Arsenal,ARTETA OUT?? HAVERTZ OUT??? We are so back !
414,Arsenal,The team I love is back 😍 
415,Arsenal,Gabriel is the best in the whole FUCKING world at doing exactly that!!! 
416,Arsenal,Too easy…Sporting have no idea what’s hitting them 
417,Arsenal,Ode and Saka have the left side on suicide watch 
418,Arsenal,Look like a actual good team now. Ode you saved us 
419,Arsenal,Big Gabi is our best player dont @ me 
420,Arsenal,Incredible half. Make it 4 nil at 60 minutes then make all the subs for fresh legs this weekend. 
421,Arsenal,best half of the season Probably best half of any squad in world football this season.
422,Arsenal,we're so back. 
423,Arsenal,Saka has been unbelievable omg!!! I can’t believe he had people saying he should be benched for foden 💀😭 
424,Arsenal,"We could rotate some, mostly because it's West Ham away and would be sweet to keep clean sheets in the league and rest key players to score as much goals as possible. Goal difference is very likely to decide top 8, if we can score a bucket load here we really should try to"
425,Arsenal,Mother of god we have played some sexy af footy 
426,Arsenal,"We are nothing without Odegaard. I think it's a great challenge for the new Sporting director to find a proper backup to Ødeggard.
While Nwaneri is the obvious candidate, he must be slowly integrated into the first team."
427,Arsenal,"Not trying to overreact but we will literally go unbeaten until we play city again

WHU (A), MUN (H), FUL (A), Monaco (H), EVE (H), CRY (H), CRY(A), IPS (H), BRE (A), BHA (A), SHIT (H), AVL (H), Zagreb (H), WOL (A), Girona (A) ... and then City are eating 5 at the Emirates COYG That looks like a relatively easy run of games. That worries me. Haha, it’s fated to happen. 

Seriously though we are a different side with our best team back, best in the PL. “But but but but but no Rodri so our results don’t matter”"
428,Arsenal,"10/10 performance so far, no notes other than man we're good "
429,Arsenal,Lovely lads 
430,Arsenal,Why splash for gyokeres when we have big Gabi I get what you are saying but Gyokeres would definitely improve our attack especially in the tight games. Big Gabi is inevitable from corners
431,Arsenal,Life is really different with our captain on the field. Not only is he one of the best playmaker in the world but he somehow makes all his teammates around him play much much better! 
432,Arsenal,"Rampaging, fearsome, dominant 

We’re collecting Portuguese scalps tonight "
433,Arsenal,"Absolutely smashed them. Gyokeres has been invisible, and that poor left back is gonna be seeing Saka in his nightmares for weeks. You can tell rice is coming back from injury, looks a bit behind the pace. Id like to see merino in the second half "
434,Arsenal,"Timber is a gem

435,Arsenal,It's so nice to finally see Arsenal play some good fast offensive football! This is why I love to see them play! 
436,Arsenal,Phenomenal 
437,Arsenal,"Rice had no business hitting that. Martinelli was fairly open to tuck it away. Apart from that, beautiful half. "
438,Arsenal,This Gyökeres guy is the worst striker i have seen...unless he wants to join us in the summer then he is the second best st 
439,Arsenal,"Job Done. Rotate. Hope Skelly and Ethan get some time, this is a great experience for them Funnily enough this is the rotated side lmao. But I agree, get Jorgi, Merino, and Jesus on"
440,Arsenal,"Get odegaard off please A) Ode is capable of playing 90
B) it's not a physical match so not too worried about impact injury
C) he makes us purr and GD could be clutch in the table so need to keep this score or more 

But yes, I hope he comes on just to give Nwaneri a run around for 20-30mins"
441,Arsenal,Oh no lmao 
442,Arsenal,Hold off on the subs for now lol 
443,Arsenal,Does Arteta give the squad cake at halftime? 
444,Arsenal,Can’t fucking stand how complacent this team gets when it’s comfortable Is conceding a corner really a sign of complacency? Momentum does shift naturally in games sometimes but it is weird how often we seem to concede the moment that momentum does shift
445,Arsenal,That goal all started from saka’s bad pass We shouldn’t be talking about a pass before a corner…
446,Arsenal,"Is conceding a corner really a sign of complacency? What happened before that was a sign of complacency

(Also calafiori was shit on the corner)"
447,Arsenal,Momentum does shift naturally in games sometimes but it is weird how often we seem to concede the moment that momentum does shift 
448,Arsenal,We shouldn’t be talking about a pass before a corner… The pass led to the corner

(Also calafiori was shit on the corner) Do you just fking wait for any goal we concede to shit on the team? What a miserable person you are Calafiori Has been shit a few times this season when it comes to defending."
450,Arsenal,The pass led to the corner 
451,Arsenal,"Do you just fking wait for any goal we concede to shit on the team? What a miserable person you are Nah.

I was buzzing in the first half"
452,Arsenal,Calafiori Has been shit a few times this season when it comes to defending. Thanks for your incredible insight

i'm sure he'e buzzing Thats not how football agents work though, his agent might see Nwaneri a better route to constant first team football away from Arsenal - and a way of filling his own pockets. Plenty of times it has happened.


German clubs would come knocking, he'll have offers. Up to Arsenal to better the offer and guarantee more playing time Do we know it’s his boyhood club or are we saying that cause he was at the academy? I think it’s a term that’s a bit overused, potentially."

500,Arsenal,"before he signed pro deal, thought he’s off to City or Chelsea. Don’t think we’re in the same position anymore. Kid would be stupid or must be ill advised not to sign new contract with us. 

Fans love him. He’s capable of taking the new step. The path is there for first team. So sign new deal Ethan According to Ornstein when he signed the contract last year he never had any intention of leaving and actually turned down more lucrative offers from other clubs to stay with us. Think some twitter accounts blew it out of proportion how close he was to actually leaving If he has the same agent as Saka and co then it will be a drawn out process but probably get done our recent history of giving academy useful and important minutes should really talk loudly here.

We don't have to make promises, we can show our stars (ESR/Saka/Nketiah) and their pathways. Sign the contract big boy sign the contract! What's his first team path?  Waiting a decade for Odegaard and Saka to retire?  

He's so talented but I really struggle to see where he fits into this team in the short/mid term.  Much like Odegaard and Saka, he has a clear angle bias issuing from his preferred foot and is at his best when he's driving inwards on the carry from the right side.  I'm happy to be proven wrong by future performances, but I just don't see him being anywhere near as effective on the left.

If Arteta were Pep, I would be thrilled to see Nwaneri integrated as a regular rotation piece, which is exactly how Pep developed Foden.  But Arteta isn't Pep and he's given me no reason to believe he'll be undertaking such a massive shift in his managerial philosophy in the near future."
501,Arsenal,"Pretty sure this was agreed when he signed his scholarship as a package deal to convince him to stay, unless I’m forgetting something.

Edit: https://x.com/David_Ornstein/status/1674391067842555905

On a pro deal already, so I assume this would just be a senior level pay rise and extension. Yep, he can sign a longer contract when he turns 18 compared to 17. This is what I was looking for, I remember this being mentioned when he got the last contract."
502,Arsenal,give him number 10 fuck it Dude that 10 is cursed.  Better to not give it Think it’s 100% his in the summer. No marquee signing will be taking it away from him.

507,Arsenal,Incredible turn around if true considering I thought he was gone a year and a half ago and had already made my peace with losing him 
508,Arsenal,He's outscoring Nico Williams so far 
509,Arsenal,"Considering Nwaneri has been at Arsenal since he was 8, should we not be more assured over this contract situation than those where the lot left for Chelsea and Utd and co? I mean those lads only had a few years in late teens at the club before first team action. "

One key thing they need to address is increasing his income as he progresses. while this is usually done by renegotiating the contract I would like to see clubs starting to put clauses n to say that once they reach key milestones they can have a pay rise.

But Arteta isn't Pep and he's given me no reason to believe he'll be undertaking such a massive shift in his managerial philosophy in the near future. Spoken like someone who has no idea how players become first team regulars. You think Saka and Odegaard will keep their present levels intact for the entirety of next decade in 50 games a season? He’s been our first or second sub in quite a few games this season.

Given our propensity to rest Ode and Saka for atleast 20 mnts every game, it’s highly likely he features in most of our games this year.

Add these to it cup game 90’s, and he’s making far more appearances than most teenagers in Europe.

Long term, it’s anyones guess how his development is.

Maybe he develops off the left?

Maybe Ode declines or turns injury prone?

Maybe Ode or Saka leave?

There’s so many variables.

When Saka was breaking through, we had a 80M signing just signed. His pathway was, by the same narrative, blocked.

He started as a LB, then LW (despite having Auba playing the role), and finally RW.

Bellerin broke into the RB spot because of injuries and made the spot his own.

~~Nature~~ players will find a way Nwaneri has like double the minutes that Foden had at the same age you melon. Also, Arteta played Ethan on the left side plenty in the preseason tour, so he's clearly preparing for him there as an option as well. Aight genius so how much should we sell him for then? You reckon we could get couple millions in January? I’m excited to see Saka and Øde start every game for next decade"

536,Arsenal,"This is what I was looking for, I remember this being mentioned when he got the last contract. "
537,Arsenal,Dude that 10 is cursed.  Better to not give it I think 10 and 14 should remain vacant for some time. 14 has some serious weight to it and 10 just seems cursed Someone has to break the curse. He is the chosen one Don’t really believe in that sort of stuff. Wilshere was just really unlucky with injuries but absolute class when fit. Smith Rowe in my opinion wasn’t quite good enough. I do feel a player needs to earn the right to wear that number though.
538,Arsenal,"Think it’s 100% his in the summer. No marquee signing will be taking it away from him. The only player who would wear that shirt that is realistically leaving their club and worth going after is Wirtz, but I don’t think the club would spend the 100M plus he’s going to command, and I don’t think we’re gonna get him. And he may not even be leaving Leverkusen."
539,Arsenal,Just slightly more optimistic here. We should offer him 20-year contract. No? Til' he's 90!

Hopefully can get an agreement, he's certainly a player we'd want to keep"
545,Arsenal,"I don’t know where this idea that we owe a 17 year old massive playing time is coming from, but I just don’t understand it. That's football for you - no one 'owes' anyone playing time, and he doesn't 'owe' us to stay and sign. 


Talented young kid bursting onto the EPL scene, but with high calibre/profile players ahead of him - agent understands this and that his client will potentially be worth a lot to him and engineers a move elsewhere with favourable terms.


Nwaneri himself of course might not think this way, and ultimately will be down to him. Arteta was happy to dump ESR & Viera and promote Nwaneri, hopefully that shows the player the pathway and trust is there."
546,Arsenal,"He needs a good head on his shoulders, otherwise if he goes chasing the money he will never fulfill his potential.

Look at Fabio carvelio who looked promising and now after a 25m move in the summer can't get into Brentford team and his dad's trash talking Brentford.

552,Arsenal,17 year old boy making you erect is crazy You’re a weirdo bro [deleted]
553,Arsenal,https://preview.redd.it/utykep8pja3e1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df18e7dd1445e1724e99b9a92733889be9d364c0 
554,Arsenal,https://preview.redd.it/uwkqa7jje93e1.jpeg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6126bb2b3bf1a6c91e2e75b2e84306e15400039d 
555,Arsenal,"Pretty sure he does.

All hale enders end up with the same agent for some reason.

And then he always does us dirty. If you’re talking about the agency who rep Saka, Nketiah, Balogun and Iwobi, I wouldn’t say they’ve ever really done us dirty. We’ve always reached the desired outcome with all of those players, sometimes it just took some time, which is normal. It’s their job to get the best possible outcome for their players. "
556,Arsenal,"Spoken like someone who has no idea how players become first team regulars. You think Saka and Odegaard will keep their present levels intact for the entirety of next decade in 50 games a season? Fine, I was being a bit hyperbolic.  Let's lower the bar to five years, which I think undersells Odegaard's probable longevity.  Let's say he does both ACLs and declines, leaves for Madrid, whatever.

Do you really expect Ethan to be happy to sit on the bench for five years?  He's too talented for that.  This is a player who is good enough to start for most teams in the Prem *right now*.  This is especially true if he makes good on his potential; we all know that Arteta defers to seniority, so even if Nwaneri becomes a world class player, he'd still be playing second fiddle to Odegaard.

To be clear, I'm not worried about whether Nwaneri is good enough to eventually provide competition to Saka/Odegaard, because I think he is.  I'm worried about how his profile and best position(s) interacts with Arteta's managerial style (and by style, I mean shortcomings)."
557,Arsenal,"He’s been our first or second sub in quite a few games this season.

Given our propensity to rest Ode and Saka for atleast 20 mnts every game, it’s highly likely he features in most of our games this year.

Add these to it cup game 90’s, and he’s making far more appearances than most teenagers in Europe.

Long term, it’s anyones guess how his development is.

Maybe he develops off the left?

Maybe Ode declines or turns injury prone?

Maybe Ode or Saka leave?

There’s so many variables.

When Saka was breaking through, we had a 80M signing just signed. His pathway was, by the same narrative, blocked.

He started as a LB, then LW (despite having Auba playing the role), and finally RW.

Bellerin broke into the RB spot because of injuries and made the spot his own.

~~Nature~~ players will find a way Where are you getting our propensity to rest Ode 20 minutes per game? He started 35 PL games last year. He played 3091 minutes. That's 88.31 minutes per games. You're inflating his average rest by 11.86x. Even if you factor in the 3 games he didn't play, dividing the number by 38 instead, he still averages under 9 minutes of rest per game.

He averaged 83.3 minutes per game in CL as well. That's despite not starting one game. 

He's averaging 85 minutes per PL game this year. 

Saka has played less than 79 minutes once this season. When we pulled Saka for Ben White against City due to the red card. Can Nwaneri play fullback? Ode has played less than 82 once. When he played 73 against Brighton, a game where the medics checked him out several times. 

Saka is averaging 82 minutes per game this season. Last season it was 83.4. Where are you getting these 20 minutes every game from? Even combined it's not getting close to 20 minutes per game.

Yeah if we just flat out lie and ignore reality, there's tons of game time available for him. Given our propensity to play Odegaard 2 minutes per game, he can play 88 minutes every game."
558,Arsenal,"Nwaneri has like double the minutes that Foden had at the same age you melon. Also, Arteta played Ethan on the left side plenty in the preseason tour, so he's clearly preparing for him there as an option as well. Good thing I'm talking about how Foden was developed over the course of his career and not making a 1:1 comparison with where he was with respect to Nwaneri at this very instant, you melon.

Preseason means nothing and you know it.  If you're not able to engage in good faith and actually react to the words I'm typing, don't respond at all. Calling someone a melon and then resorting to meaningless preseason friendlies is peak. Thanks for the laugh. Why look at actual data when we were desperate for people to step up when you can use preseason?"
559,Arsenal,"Aight genius so how much should we sell him for then? You reckon we could get couple millions in January? I’m excited to see Saka and Øde start every game for next decade Where did I say we should sell him?  I'm just sharing my concerns, and they are, frankly, well founded given Arteta's track record.  

>I’m excited to see Saka and Øde start every game for next decade

This but unironically"
560,Arsenal,I think 10 and 14 should remain vacant for some time. 14 has some serious weight to it and 10 just seems cursed Yeah.  I think we should just retire them tbh.  14 has like you said too much weight and no one can live up to it. Call me insane but I want Gyökeres to rock that 14 shirt and Wirtz that 10.
561,Arsenal,Someone has to break the curse. He is the chosen one 
562,Arsenal,"Don’t really believe in that sort of stuff. Wilshere was just really unlucky with injuries but absolute class when fit. Smith Rowe in my opinion wasn’t quite good enough. I do feel a player needs to earn the right to wear that number though. Smith Rowe was good enough, his issue were the injuries Nwaneri already earned it by being the most talented prospect Hale end ever produced. He is like the perfect Wenger ball player. Honorable mentions to Wilshere, Ashley Cole, MLS, Saka, Dowman. Adams and Liam Brady are beyond that level as they are living legends "
563,Arsenal,"The only player who would wear that shirt that is realistically leaving their club and worth going after is Wirtz, but I don’t think the club would spend the 100M plus he’s going to command, and I don’t think we’re gonna get him. And he may not even be leaving Leverkusen. "
564,Arsenal,Til' he's 90! 
565,Arsenal,"Could we ever get a smile, young man? Relax. We know t’s intimidating but get use to it.😊 at this point I think there are more photos on this sub of him smiling than of him being stoic"
566,Arsenal,"This is pretty common actually yeah.


Hopefully can get an agreement, he's certainly a player we'd want to keep "
567,Arsenal,"That's football for you - no one 'owes' anyone playing time, and he doesn't 'owe' us to stay and sign. 


Talented young kid bursting onto the EPL scene, but with high calibre/profile players ahead of him - agent understands this and that his client will potentially be worth a lot to him and engineers a move elsewhere with favourable terms.


Nwaneri himself of course might not think this way, and ultimately will be down to him. Arteta was happy to dump ESR & Viera and promote Nwaneri, hopefully that shows the player the pathway and trust is there. agree except arteta has expressed the opposite of “being happy to dump ESR” — ‘[And I have a feeling like ‘argh’, that I have not got the best out of him. Obviously a lot of things happened in that time.’](https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arteta-smith-rowe-arsenal-fc-regret-b1178109.html)"
568,Arsenal,"I imagine it's also good for him to be around Saka and Odegaard, two guys who had to deal with the weight of the Wonderkid label from an early age. "
569,Arsenal,"I will be messaging you in 10 years on [**2034-11-26 17:05:35 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2034-11-26%2017:05:35%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1h0bt6t/fabrizio_romano_arsenal_keep_working_on_new_deal/lz3np69/?context=3)

570,Arsenal,My guy is investing 
571,Arsenal,You’re a weirdo bro Ratio says otherwise bro
572,Arsenal,[deleted] Agreed. Very weird thing to say
573,Arsenal,"If you’re talking about the agency who rep Saka, Nketiah, Balogun and Iwobi, I wouldn’t say they’ve ever really done us dirty.

This seems like a very valid concern, and I don’t understand the downvotes. Maybe I'm overhyping the kid, but I genuinely believe he has a good chance to be a superstar. 

Odegaard is our most valuable player. I said it last year and I think our poor stretch without him validated that. It's going to be tough for Nwaneri to get minutes. Yeah Odegaard can't play 90 every game, but he's going to do it for the majority of them. If this kid is as good as I think he's going to be, that's not going to fly at some point. It's fine for now, but like you said, what about 5 years? Odegaard will be 30. He should still be a very good player since so much of his game is based on skill, creativity, and passing. Meanwhile Nwaneri is going to be hitting his prime. Will he really be content to split time when most places will give him the clear starter role? 

Maybe we move on from Ode in a few years, but I don’t think it's a clear path that I'd be stoked about as Nwaneri. Hopefully they figure it out in a way that keeps everyone happy and maximizes abilities and output, but I don’t think it's crystal clear."

So either you’re intentionally misinterpreting my comment to fit your narrative cuz you have a hate boner for the club/ manager or you’re unable to read.

You’re referencing Ode’s minutes played LY while my claim was about this year. So your entire first argument is bogus and not worth the effort you put into writing it.

Saka 24/25 has played nearly 1300 minutes in 16 games, averaging 78 mnts a game.
Given a game averages 100 minutes, he has atleast 22 mnts of rest this season.

This does not imply he is routinely subbed off in every game with 20 minutes to play. Just making it clear because clearly reading isn’t your strongest ability.

Ode 24/25 has nearly 420 minutes in 6 games averaging 70 minutes a game.

Nwaneri 24/25 has 240 minutes in 6 appearances averaging 26 minutes a game.

Let’s compare the average minutes of a similar youth prodigy, whose induction has been hailed as exemplary shall we?

Enter Phil Foden. Here’s his avg minutes per game per year.

17/18: 44 minutes in 5 appearances = 9/game

18/19: 1100 in 26 appearances = 42/game

19/20: 1700 minutes in 38 appearances = 44/game

20/21: 3376 minutes in 50 appearances = 67/game

In his 2nd season, he had 26 appearances. Nwaneri, in his first season already has 6 and will potentially hit 20-25 based on his current trajectory and will potentially clock close to 1000 minutes.

So, in essence Nwaneri is now being introduced to the fold quicker than Foden. And this is despite Pep usually fielding weakened teams in the FA and Carabao as he has less pressure to win compared to other managers who opt for fuller squads.

Do us all a favour. Stop talking out of your bumhole."
576,Arsenal,"Good thing I'm talking about how Foden was developed over the course of his career and not making a 1:1 comparison with where he was with respect to Nwaneri at this very instant, you melon.

642,Arsenal,One off our best lineup imo 
643,Arsenal,Would've liked to have seen a Rice-Merino-Odegaard midfield. 
644,Arsenal,"Absolutely no fucking excuse tonight. We have to smash them I know City are in a rough patch, but Sporting just waxed them 4-1. And are not a team to be taken lightly, this will be an extremely difficult fixture. You’ll be the first into the match thread being toxic when your unrealistic demands aren’t met then…"
645,Arsenal,The Ben White disrespect in the sub is crazy 
646,Arsenal,"Mikel is not fucking about: that is our strongest current lineup.

Let's go. "
647,Arsenal,"Shoehorning partey into this team to play rice out of his best position and sidelining merino. Weird behavior. We don’t even need partey’s progressive passes with odegaard/timber/calafiori able to break and receive between the lines. I think it is the other way around, partey is way better than rice at distributing and in attacking play, so we have rice at 8 when it is not good at it."
648,Arsenal,"Why are we still trying a partey - rice midfield

It’s so stupid I’m wondering what it’s gonna take to break his trust in it. Or at least adjust it so they’re playing alongside each other instead Rice up in no man’s land. Because it worked beautifully? What? Are you just trying to forget the beginning of the season, and the back end of last season, because of one game? Literally our best midfield trio since Arteta joined… Partey and Rice in midfield have lost 1 game together ever, and that was the red card against Bournemouth

But yes it definitely doesn’t work You’re right.  It should be Partey Merino Ode until Rice can prove he’s better than Partey. Eeee what? Same one that went 17-1-1? Is Mikel stupid? We played better without Rice on Saturday and he better turns up today and/or the team plays better with him i thought he wouldnt start after that horrible performance vs atalanta"
649,Arsenal,"can we please get that rapist out of here, merino has proven himself enough to be in games like this "
650,Arsenal,"Are we ever going to see Rice at 6 again Probably when Partey gets injured, charged, or released"
651,Arsenal,Partey Rice midfield again😭 
652,Arsenal,Ffs man get Partey out of lineups Partey better than rice so far this year. Try watching the matches 👍
653,Arsenal,"no one is enamored with the Partey-Rice-Ode midfield right now, but seeing them with these FBs and Havertz rotating into the middle will definitely be interesting... It's pretty clear at this point that Arteta regards it as our strongest midfield, which represents at least some degree of enamour."
654,Arsenal, #5 starting and Rice between the lines again. Long game incoming 
655,Arsenal,"Nice nice, I wonder when we get to see rice at 6 Merino and Ode as Attacking mids "
656,Arsenal,Give me that mid week 0-0 I've been missing 
657,Arsenal,this guy as our 6? get ready for 0 control 
658,Arsenal,We are better with Merino in and Rice at 6 and this will eventually become obvious 
659,Arsenal,"Rice at the 8 again going to hinder Martinelli terrible lineup as well Jesus should’ve started over Havertz I think terrible is crazy but I don’t disagree about rice at the 8 Delusional Once again moving the world’s second best #6 to shoehorn in \#5

Why is is so hard to play Odegaard Rice Merino Let people who are more qualified make decisions, keep your waffle to DD. Thanks. Agreed, roll with Saturdays lineup Arteta is a stubborn prat. 

He won’t change it even though we can see it doesn’t work"
660,Arsenal,Dead midfield 
661,Arsenal,"We're definitely seeing Tierney get some minutes this season if he doesn't leave in Jan right. What are the odds he stays all season long, a senior player of his quality and he doesn't play even the final minute of injury time or in an injury crisis I wouldn’t be surprised if he stayed the whole year. Doubt a lot of teams would look to spend anything on someone with his injury history despite the talent. 

I think he does get some playing time in the various cup games though, and hopefully plenty of clean up duty in blowout wins. I for one will be very excited to see him back out there. He was one of my favorites during some up and down seasons. With how cursed LB is he’ll probably play out of necessity. At worst, he’ll get some token cup minutes to put him “on the market” so to speak there were rumors of a loan move back to celtic He’s a better LB than Kiwior and honestly he’s probably a better CB than him too lol"
662,Arsenal,"My, that is a very strong bench, we have these days All the better to win the league(s) with"
663,Arsenal,oh my god tierney polar bear is back in arlington texas After how many years?
664,Arsenal,That’s a strong bench 
665,Arsenal,"is it just ben white we're missing? literally everyone else available Tomi I think is the only missing player other than Benjamin Tomi is missing too Pretty much our best 11

Dont think timber is a downgrade on white except for corner duty Tomiyasu lol Also Tomiyasu"
666,Arsenal,What Arteta has been building all these years for: the quadruple left back bench. 
667,Arsenal,"Our best lineup right now Partey for Merino, White for Timber, but yeah, almost.  Rice out for Merino Only good performance Partey and Rice had together was when Partey played RB."
668,Arsenal,FUCKING SPOT ON MATE 
669,Arsenal,Martinelli goes up levels with Calafiori behind him

736,Aston Villa,"Juve travelling with only 14 outfield players and not taking Dougie or Vlahovic. Definitely seen worse pre-match news! Highest number of times turned over and highest shots conceded, this also bodes well."
737,Aston Villa,"At this stage I'd just take a match without conceding a ridiculous goal. Fucking insane how many shit goals we've conceded this season, and honestly in general since we came up. a little ambitious for my tastes Seeing the results of this evening's matches in the CL, I really don't sympathise this trend that's been going on this matchday of very high-scoring games, with most being one-sided... (5-1 for arsenal, 6-0 for athletico madrid, 3-0 barca, 6-1 atalanta, 5-0 leverkusen). IK it doesn't actually say anything about tomorrow, but it doesn't exactly lift the mood 😅"
738,Aston Villa,"I think we probably need 3 more points to 100% qualify for the knockouts - which is all anyone could've really asked for before the Champions League started. It looks a tough game on paper but they're a massively depleted squad at the moment and they're hardly flying in the league. Hoping for a big performance to take some momentum into the Christmas period, although if you asked me now I'd probably take a point! "
739,Aston Villa,"As someone who watched the Juventes v Milan game, prepare for a highly defensive potentially boring game. Juve have one of the best defenses in the serie A. It all depends low block they are. Tim Weah has been in really good form for them finding goals, one to watch. Also their Turkish left winger has a lot of pace and we know our right side is especially vulnerable. That’s a key match up. "
740,Aston Villa,"Was buzzing for this when I bought my ticket but that feels like a long time ago now and we've hit our slump since then. As it is I'm naturally feeling quite apprehensive, but trying to muster some positive energy for it. Let's hope it signals the end of this current shakey run and we put on another stellar CL performance under the VP lights. I'd love to see a confident, fluid display to shake off the malaise of the last few weeks. 

UTV. "
741,Aston Villa,"I think we can win this, which would put us in good shape for qualifying for the next round. "
742,Aston Villa,"Smash them and onto Chelsea at the weekend. No drama here. 4-0, goals from Watkins, Mings, Durán and Barkley. UTV "
743,Aston Villa,I just hope the fans are up for it in the same way as the Bayern game .. I’m sitting in the Doug Ellis right next to the away fans .. so please Villans sing your lungs out!! UTV 
744,Aston Villa,"Konsa and Kamara available - yay!  Hope they are both fit to start.  Given our recent run I'd take a draw now, but I think we can win this. "
745,Aston Villa,"No basketball tomorrow, right Tyrone? "
746,Aston Villa,Start strong on front foot. Let them know they're up for a game. Take no risks at the back. Cash should be left back. Forget Philogen up front. Possibly even risk Duran and Watkins for more than 30 mins Surely Cash should be right back?

755,Aston Villa,"Parking on the roads around the stadium is a nightmare. There are parking spaces on just park, but finding them is hard. Trains have notoriously low capacity and many people sneak off early to try to get ahead of the crowds. "
756,Aston Villa,"Get the train and have a few beers. There’s plenty of trains back after. I’m a proponent of everyone who could feasibly get public transport to VP should do, means less traffic for all involved. Adds about an hour to your commute time before you even get on the train which in midweek doesn't sound fun. For a night game there are not ""plenty of trains""

If we assume  5 minutes of extra time and then a really generous 10 minutes to get to Aston then they have a choice of the 22:46 or 23:14 to get back to Lichfield"
757,Aston Villa,"I live on the Cross City line too, and use it to get to games. 

The trains run until almost midnight. If you're not in a rush to get back, chill and have a beer in the Aston Inn after the game for 45mins to an hour, then get the train. 

If you want to get the train straight after the game you'll be queuing for ages, or have to leave at 80mins and run for the train. "
758,Aston Villa,"I'd drive, waiting for a train is unbearable after the game. When I was a steward I had no issues at all in the 9 seasons I did it parking on a road nearby the stadium, though I did have to get there like 2.5hrs earlier than a punter would. The games I did last season I got the train a couple times and that was awful after the game, one game I walked back to town and that was alright but I went to 2 games with my elder cousin and he drove and we got close to the stadium and away easily, only arrived about 1hr15 before those games. There's a bit more going on around the stadium now so getting there a bit early isn't bad, though being midweek might not be too doable if working. "
759,Aston Villa,"the train is a good option, especially if you’re travelling the opposite direction to new street. i’ve noticed the queue is shorter after night games too so i think you’ll be fine! "
760,Aston Villa,"I went for Wolves and I parked in Star City. Free and ai had no problems. 20 min walk, but that's not bad imo "
761,Aston Villa,Park at Star City.  It’s a 30 minute walk to the stadium but you don’t want to be on the stadium side of the junction of Lichfield Road and Aston Hall Road traffic lights unless you *really* enjoy traffic jams.   From there you’ll be able to get home via Nechells Parkway and Chester Road pretty quickly. 
762,Aston Villa,"Adds about an hour to your commute time before you even get on the train which in midweek doesn't sound fun. I mean it completely depends where you live?

Midweek beers are great fun, actually"

764,Aston Villa,"I mean it completely depends where you live?

Midweek beers are great fun, actually Yes, they are, but if I had work the next day I'd rather spend the hour it'd take to get on the train or to sink a couple beers, in my car trying to get home(the last time I did it I was home within the hour and I lived in south Birmingham). Saturday games however, get plastered and wait."

766,Aston Villa,"I didn’t actually see the incident, but I saw the car drive off and people chasing after it. Had we left thirty seconds earlier then we might have been right in the middle of it, feeling very thankful that we weren’t. Glad nobody was killed and I hope they find that driver soon. "
767,Aston Villa,"Ah, didn't realise Townley had made the jump from the dead bird app. Good for him.

779,Aston Villa,"He has plenty of good qualities he just isn't suited to partnering Torres. He was brought in by Gerrard to be a more Ball playing option than Mings. But since then Torres has joined and is an elite level ball player.


From what I can tell he typically plays when either Cash or Konsa are out. He is fine next to Torres in a mid to low block. When we play a higher line, the complete lack of pace between them is a liability for sure. Particularly when Konsa is injured and can't fill in from Right Back.


Trouble is he is on massive wages so it could be a stretch to offload him. Which is annoying cus with the right partner he could be very good. Another Gerrard signing on massive wages hamstringing us. Think people seriously underestimate the financial damage having Coutinho/Carlos/Digne being our top 3 earners and all 3 will be leaving for less than we signed them for. Yeah, you’re right that for a certain role, there is a player there? Do you think he’s in particularly bad form at the moment and is likely to therefore be better at certain points when he regains form, or is it a case of he just doesn’t really fit here? 
I know he’s had some brilliant performances (City/Arsenal last year, Bayern this year) but I just struggle to understand the benefit of starting him so often (especially now with Mings back)

Also completely separate thing but where do you stand on the Konsa RB/Ned/Bogarde options when Cash is out? All of this. He’s also a bit fragile for such a physical specimen. We will do everything we can in the transfer window to bring in a player who can play both CB and RB, and moving Carlos will be key to making that work, but it will be a heavy ask. Maybe Chelsea will need some more mutual PSR relief 🤷"
780,Aston Villa,"I think he’s mentally checked out.

Like him not going with Mateta for the first goal. Hes just being lazy or not concentrating. The goals he’s gifted this season with his poor passing against Palace and Wolves make me want to pull my hair out.

Problem is we’ve got him gifting goals or Cash diving in like a mad man in our own box to gift pens. Emery doesn’t have much of a choice unless Mings comes back to what he was and Konsa plays RB "
781,Aston Villa,"We're stuck for options. We've got Carlos who occasionally puts in a world class performance, shutting out the likes of Arsenal, Man City and Bayern, but can also play like Zat Knight when it suits him, or we have Cash, who occasionally looks dangerous going forward but almost always looks dangerous in and around our own box. Then you've got Mings who after being out of the game for a while has forgotten you can't pick up the ball during live play.

We should have signed a right back in the summer, simple as that. Fair play to Monchi and the boys for guiding us through tricky financial circumstances, but I feel like a lot of decisions in the summer were financially driven rather than football driven. Signing Maatsen for example when we have Digne and Moreno on the books, but leaving a gaping hole on the other side of the field. That's funny I was about to post referencing Zat Knight too. They got a matching 'laxadazical style'. > Occasionally looks dangerous going forwards, but almost always looks dangerous in and around our own box. 

Brilliant! Couldn’t have said it better myself :)"
782,Aston Villa,"Physically he's a beast and everything you want in a CB. Tactically and strategically is where it falls apart. We can't seem to play a high line with him (although we haven't seemed to do that all season so far which is a different problem entirely), he doesn't track players that well and the key issue: his decision making and delivery on the ball is woeful*.

He's had some amazing games for us but it does feel like he disappoints more than performs to expectations.

I don't like singling out individuals though tbh. We've got issues all over the pitch at present and have done all season - got very lucky in more than a few of our wins and generally I've been watching through my fingers for the most part. 

Always said this season would be a transitional one and it seems to be playing out like that. Team/squad cohesion is clearly off and Emery is perhaps too keen to over-rotate our first XI which doesn't help. 

* that said, Pau Torres was supposedly our key distributor from the back last season and this season he's been appalling too (apart from the assist to Duran in the Bayern game), so fcuk knows what's going on. "
783,Aston Villa,"He's got speed, he's powerful and can tackle. On free kicks he makes his presence known up front. He makes mistakes playing the ball out but all our defenders seem to this season and we need a squad. "
784,Aston Villa,"He's a liability, has played exceptionally well in a handful of games when mentally 100% switched on (in the 'big' games) but otherwise is liable to make positional and passing errors at least 2-3 times a match. In his defence (excuse the pun) he has had to play in a constantly changing back 4 which clearly doesn't help any of the defenders and he's proven he can be colossal at times (in games against Man City, Arsenal, Bayern) but if you only turn up for 2 or 3 games a season you're not worth persevering with. Imo our best defensive partnership is Konsa and Mings but questions remain over Tyrone after the injury and I can't see Emery playing without Pau. We also need Onana and/or Kamara to stay fit consistently to have that shield in midfield. "
785,Aston Villa,I had a little dig into this [only this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/avfc/comments/1gzg09v/on_diego_carlos/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) 
786,Aston Villa,"I saw someone say the other day that a lot of his mistakes come from laziness. I think that's definitely true to an extent.


He can get himself up for a game if he has to think about every single minute of the game, but we can't just say every time he has another error ""he was good against city arsenal bayern"", because he was also poor against spurs, poor against city away last year, poor against Liverpool. So it's not like playing the big teams is some cheat code for him. "
787,Aston Villa,"He isn't supposed to be playing as much he is. He's 3rd or 4th choice at CB. He's only playing so much due to injuries to other CBS or RB's.

Your not going to get prime Maldini as 3rd for 4th choice, so you have to accept flaws in him. As a whole I think we probably have the one of the bestt 4 CB's groups in the league and almost certainly the best 4 we've ever had, This is the correct take. He only plays that much because injury to either our Right back OR Left back means he plays, whereas a normal backup would only back 1 position"
788,Aston Villa,"He isnt good enough but we haven't got a choice. When Konsa is fit, Cash seems to be injured meaning Konsa is shifted to RB so Carlos plays and when Cash is finally fit, Konsa is injured so again Carlos has to play.

Nedjelkovic isnt trusted it seems and neither is Bogarde at CB anyway. I think this is Diego's last season for us tbh. "
789,Aston Villa,[removed] Neither him or Mings are good enough for where we want to be. It’s just Carlos is costing us every week so there’s going to be post about him
790,Aston Villa,"Don't know, but I think we should liberate Guehi from Palace. "
791,Aston Villa,I noticed with Carlos he plays one of the big clubs and he's arguably our best defender. Yet against the other teams it's like he thinks he's better than them and doesn't try 
792,Aston Villa,I've always thought he was a liability. He's a mid-table prem-level player at best. 
793,Aston Villa,He always looks like he's going to get carded when he plays 
794,Aston Villa,Another Gerrard signing on massive wages hamstringing us. Think people seriously underestimate the financial damage having Coutinho/Carlos/Digne being our top 3 earners and all 3 will be leaving for less than we signed them for. Most teams get over shot at investing to break the champions league. Thankfully we had two. Hopefully we can make some PSR sales this summer to balance the books then go again.
795,Aston Villa,"Yeah, you’re right that for a certain role, there is a player there? Do you think he’s in particularly bad form at the moment and is likely to therefore be better at certain points when he regains form, or is it a case of he just doesn’t really fit here? 
I know he’s had some brilliant performances (City/Arsenal last year, Bayern this year) but I just struggle to understand the benefit of starting him so often (especially now with Mings back)

Also completely separate thing but where do you stand on the Konsa RB/Ned/Bogarde options when Cash is out? He doesn't fit how we're trying to play in most games. If we're the dominant team, he's being asked to defend a lot of space, either between him and midfield or behind him. With Torres as his partner, that's a problem, as neither are particularly quick on the turn or have quick acceleration. Put Konsa and Cash as right back, and suddenly, defending that space is a lot easier. 

His strengths are defending deeper, being physical and long ball distribution, which dont fit what we want."
796,Aston Villa,All of this. 
797,Aston Villa,"He’s also a bit fragile for such a physical specimen. We will do everything we can in the transfer window to bring in a player who can play both CB and RB, and moving Carlos will be key to making that work, but it will be a heavy ask. Maybe Chelsea will need some more mutual PSR relief 🤷 "
798,Aston Villa,That's funny I was about to post referencing Zat Knight too. They got a matching 'laxadazical style'. 
799,Aston Villa,"> Occasionally looks dangerous going forwards, but almost always looks dangerous in and around our own box. 

Brilliant! Couldn’t have said it better myself :) "
800,Aston Villa,"This is the correct take. He only plays that much because injury to either our Right back OR Left back means he plays, whereas a normal backup would only back 1 position "
801,Aston Villa,Neither him or Mings are good enough for where we want to be. It’s just Carlos is costing us every week so there’s going to be post about him He’s costing us every week because no matter how poor he’s playing he’s still less of a liability than mings. Also when mings was playing n Fucking up every week the moment he got small criticism everyone else was acting like he was innocent n don’t fuck up

His strengths are defending deeper, being physical and long ball distribution, which dont fit what we want. This is the perfect description. At this point in time Carlos should really only be starting games when either a) Torres is out and we need someone who can act as the ball player, or b) we are playing a possession team like Arsenal or Citeh where we can sit deeper and play on the break.


Defenders outside the elite level will have some errors in them. For example people would always complain about Mings being a bit of a liability and prone to an error. But if Mings wasn't prone to a few errors he would be playing for Citeh or Liverpool.


Carlos is similar, probably a shade less desirable due to his lack of pace, though he compensates for some of that through being more physical, aggressive, and technically adept defender. "

The stats from the CL are interesting, with  Carlos being our quickest defender. Top speed of 33km per hour, which is pretty rapid. A shade quicker than Konsa. It's not conclusive of anything, but suggests to me he's quick, but slow to get to that speed."

That’s why he got spun by Delaps step over. It's a very good spot this by the way. I've not seen many people mention it, though I noticed it last season.

What I'd seen was that he was getting caught out with runners coming from a few yards deep when it line didn't push, and we were struggling a bit with it. Then suddenly in one game I noticed his body position change and he was bailing us out with recovery runs every game for a good few games. Previously he'd been facing the pitch straight on, but then he turned his body so that he was half and half almost. Meant he was already half way turned when he could start his sprint (which is very good by the way, and the earlier poster was wrong about).

I do also believe that we're always so happy to talk about confidence and form with forward players, but we (football fans) seem to think that defensive players are immune to it."

They can go pretending to be you and no one will check. I assumed that once I'd downloaded to my wallet via the email (which I had) then the email was no longer valid. I agree that as long as I can get the tickets to someone's wallet we're all good."
812,Aston Villa,I just log into the app with my MiL's ID when she can't get to a game. Works a treat. You just need to give your log in to whomever takes the ticket. Or this is a good idea.
813,Aston Villa,Can’t you sell them to a friend/family member and just email them your tickets… I'm just not sure how it works now they've been downloaded to my Wallet. I don't know how to transfer them to whoever's Wallet. I'm sure it can be done but it's not going to be straight-forward as I don't know their wallet IDs.
814,Aston Villa,Can't your friends/family just sign up for their fan IDs? They could but I don't have a large family and I don't think any of them would particularly want the tickets unfortunately.
815,Aston Villa,"You can send someone the email or you can share the ticket from your wallet How are you sharing? I can’t see the option in apple wallet. I wasn't sure if the email would be valid now that I've downloaded the tickets to my wallet. I've assumed it won't be. I'll have to look into the sharing option, maybe we can do that by email."

817,Aston Villa,"Fairly sure you can just send them the email and they can add the ticket to their wallets, I’ve done it this season for the Arsenal game Nice one, thanks. It's good to be reassured."
818,Aston Villa,I’ll buy them off you 
819,Aston Villa,"Be interested to hear how you got on. From what you've wrote the only thing I could think of is to allow them your login details I think I'll probably just go in the end and struggle through my illness. I don't really want to give away the tickets, even to friends and family. I know that might sound a bit tight but I'd prefer to either go myself or be able to resell the tickets (I really wish AVFC would facilitate this though I appreciate it's a bit of an administrative burden)."
820,Aston Villa,"This is definitely a policy change on their part. Last season I had three tickets to the Liverpool game at the end of the season but maybe 48 hours before the match one of my mates tested positive for covid. None of my usuals were able to come so I phoned the ticket office and they refunded me there and then. Sure enough the day of the game there's someone sat in that seat. 

Completely shite on their part, there's no way they wouldn't have resold them. Interesting. I think the issue is that the tickets haven't gone on general sale at all. They still said if I wanted to transfer them they'd have to be someone with appropriate ticket history. They even went so far as to say if one of us was a season ticket holder the transferee would have to pay extra!"

2. It opens 3 hours before kick off I believe for Lower Grounds.
3. Try ‘aviewfrommyseat.com’
4. You should read the info on the website. Usually matchday programme, maybe a lanyard / bracelet for entry and then your food and drink.
5. Have a good walk around the whole stadium, take in the setting and also peruse the new club shop. Thanks Are you sure about the first one? I’m sure that the entrance by the mcgregor statue has a dress code of no football shirts or trainers?"

You should have a similar view to this from that block.

The holte end is to the right, the away support (Man City fans) wil be opposite in the left hand corner (from your view).

Wouldn’t bother wearing a suit, jeans a warm jumper & jacket should do you.

Visit one of the local home pubs for a pre match beer , I prefer the Aston Inn/social (generally better post match especially if we’ve won) but take your pick!

Enjoy Thank you."

863,Aston Villa,"Diego Carlos reminds me a lot of Richard Dunne - a very good defender when you play to his strengths but the more you ask of him the more his performance suffers.

It's why some of our most impressive results have come with him in the team - they're against very strong teams where we're playing deep, defending hard and looking to take advantage of them and Carlos **loves** battling it out with a striker too - and similarly why some of his worst performances have come against teams we *should* be beating because we're more open, asking him to defend more ground and contribute to the build up more.

I fully agree Konsa is the better CB, but I don't think he's getting moved out to RB to facilitate Carlos - it's more that Carlos is getting bought in because our options at RB are limited - I mean even if Konsa was in at CB, looking at the  [Defender Influence Map (Bluesky: AVFC SCOUT)](https://bsky.app/profile/avfcscout.bsky.social/post/3lbozvkr2f22x) and the [Midfielder Influence Map (Bluesky: AVFC SCOUT)](https://bsky.app/profile/avfcscout.bsky.social/post/3lbozvlzp622x) that's still an *awful* lot of ground to cover on your own because the DM's and RB aren't *quite* giving us what we need yep, good insight. I think I made my point poorly too, I meant to say what you did, re: who plays RB. I meant that as you say, we are short of options, so Konsa has to play there, and Carlos comes in at CB, but it ultimately means we are weaker in 2 positions now (Konsa not a natural RB, Carlos not as good a CB as Konsa) Good balanced view.

Carlos seems to be the preferred scape goat for recent poor results but there's always context I do get the feeling he wants to just launch the ball into orbit rather than play it from the back"

First part checks out, but he's played only 22 games in 3 years? Was at Watford u helm"
878,Aston Villa,"Remember when the club had agreed a deal to sign Sarr and it broke down after Gerrard decided to ""go a different direction"".

I think we signed dendonker after, who is on wages higher than a lot of our first team players To be fair I think talks with Sarr broke down because he wanted astronomical wages I do regret this one, Sarr looked amazing when ever I watched him, I'd check out some of the Watford games to see if he was good or just good against us. He appeared to be a legit star player at the time."
879,Aston Villa,"Looking through the team for a default penalty taker, it's difficult to pick out a player who has a bit of technique (a la tielemans) but isn't mentally weak. 
Barkley seems technically reliable but he's been through the ringer a bit and doesn't scream confidence. 

Digne maybe? We trust him on direct free kicks. Or perhaps mcginn just for his international experience. 

Rogers I think would suffer the same way Watkins does. 
Definitely not Pau or Carlos, Konsa again doesn't seem the most composed. Duran would be an easy choice but he’s probably not going to be on the pitch when we get them."
880,Aston Villa,"Watkins should be taking the pens.  He's our No 1 striker and plays for England.  Man up and take it. I don't want him on penalties, he hasn't got the composure. He's an absolute textbook case of a player who can be incredibly effective when playing on instinct, but fluffs his lines whenever he has the chance to think.

The more time he has to get in his own head, the more often he completely fucks it. Yeah, I don't understand this. I thought he would be the main man for this - goal tallies aside, it's literally his job to bang balls away. Look at the way that 'Kane (pen)' puts them away. If he wants to build on his call for an England place, this is a skill that is essential. After all, this is England...."

898,Aston Villa,"Barrenechea is not just doing 'okay'. He's doing good considering he gets called to the Argentina National Team


Agree with you though, would be great to have a versatile player to cover several position as emergency backup, someone like Ashley Young or Calum Chambers. Wash your mouth out Calum Chambers!! Lol"
899,Aston Villa,"Barrenechea would be overkill when Kamara and Onana will be more than enough in a couple of weeks.

In January we desperately need to get a RB or CB so Carlos never plays for us again. We also were licking our chops a few weeks ago when we had a ""fully fit"" squad again and now we're back to Ramsey, Onana and Kamara being out again. The main point is our midfield group is either overworked or injury prone, which isn't a great combo."
900,Aston Villa,"Barrenechea is a DM. We have two (arguably 3 if you include Barkley) players ahead of him in that position, two of which are injured but shortly returning. Playing an out and out 6 will allow the rest of our midfield to actually play in their preferred position. I'm aware of his position, which is DM/CM. He's played mainly as a midfield two for Valencia. The point isn't about him specifically

They may be shortly returning, but the whole point of the post is I don't think you can rely on them to remain fit so we're not back to the same issue of a midfield duo/trio of Youri, Ross + McGinn. 

Kamara was injured for chunks of the season before coming back and doing his ACL. He's worked his way back on the bench to sub appearances and now has a knock again. Onana has started to pick up muscle injuries and once you start getting hamstring/calf injuries they tend to happen more frequently

Seems pretty clear we need an extra body in the midfield group given the frequency of injuries among them."
901,Aston Villa,"Kamara is key. When he gets back in form he solves a lot of our current issues. Also, having Cash healthy and Konsa in his best position will make a world of difference. "
902,Aston Villa,"Not likely an option to bring back and certainly not before January. 

What do we then do with him once everyone is back fit? 3 weeks ago we were trying to find a way of fitting 6 cms into 3 spots. Broggio is more of a wide player and will likely see more of him if Bailey (who did look better yesterday) and Philogne don’t improve in the coming weeks. 

What we miss is Diaby and luiz were very good players and both unbelievably good at this stage last season. Luiz was probably the most important player in our system first half of last season and as good as Tielemans has been I don’t think he has been as good as Luiz was. I get your point about once everyone is back fit. My point being 3 weeks ago everyone was back fit and now 3 weeks later the same usual suspects are out again. Just feels like this is going to be more of the norm than having everyone fit and available, in which case I don't think we can cope with the legs of Tielemans, Barkley and McGinn as your main CM trio.

Tielemans has never had the engine that Luiz did. Luiz was more similar to what Delph would do. Tielemans is a bit more of a Petrov imo. Always dripping with sweat, controller of the tempo but just don't ask to run too much or he's gassed."
903,Aston Villa,"For me the issue isn't midfield, though I agree it could be by the end of the season if we don't rotate Tielemans. 


The biggest issue is the effect of PSR on our summer recruitment. And more specifically that Connor Gallagher didn't want to join us. I suspect Plan A was to buy Gallagher as part of our PSR talks with Chelsea instead of Maatsen. This leaves us with 37m to fix the RB slot so we aren't forced to play Konsa out wide. 


It then leaves the 50m we spent on Onana to bring in another pace option up front to allow us to rotate Bailey who is out of form and started the season injured 


That's not to say that I don't like the signings we did make. Just that they weren't very optimised to improve on the team from last season.  While I agree with you that Gallagher not coming put a real spanner in the works, I do think we'd still spend a decent amount on a left back even if he did come. 

Digne and Moreno weren't *great* last season and with both of them out of contract in 2026, both over 30 and Digne being one of our highest earners in the squad, the need to replace at least *one* of them was always going to be a priority for the team.

I think realistically if we got Gallagher, the £50m we spent on Onana would have been split between a new, younger (and Cheaper) Left back and a CB/RB Hybrid like Geertruida, which would have freed up funds for Carlos to leave This is a good post. Think our summer business hasn’t really worked, at least not yet. We may have to take one step back this year to go two forward. I guess we will get a clearer picture when/ if Kamara can settle in although it’s a big ask. I agree with your broader point that we are reliant on injury prone/over worked players. Yeah I said in the post-match thread to someone else that the Maatsen signing made sense at the time as we thought he would become our starting LB, a younger option than our 2 30+ year old LBs. However, with the state of the squad elsewhere (RB, Carlos, a winger, an engine midfielder) spending €45m on someone who is clearly not a step up from Digne and is backup, all while still having Moreno on loan at Forest, was not the smartest move. Could've kept Moreno as backup, spent on a RB or CB given Cash/Konsa/Carlos also all prone to knocks. I guess Philogene was supposed to be that Bailey competition but it's not panned out that way thus far."
904,Aston Villa,"Honestly, I think I'd prefer us to keep Barrenchea out on loan right now and instead I'd bring back Illing-Junior if we can.

Barrenchea is doing well and getting game time and as CM/DM is a position we've got the talent in and just need to figure out how to use I'd rather we focus on the future with him.

I think the problems are coming either side of the double pivot if I'm honest; that Attacking Midfielder/Second Striker role has caused all sorts of issues over the last handful of Games, with Rogers, McGinn and Buendia all failing to impress. Getting a new player there who can help control Midfield a bit better and then bringing SIJ back to provide another pacy option up top along with Bailey and Jaden gives us a lot of options.

Which then allows us to address the RB/CB situation - as part of the problem at the moment seems to be not *really* knowing what's happening on that right hand side - is the Right Winger responcible for the width or is the Fullback? is the Fullback acting like the 3rd defensive player or is that the responcibilty of one of the DM's? Figuring out what we want to do there and replacing Carlos/Cash/Kosta in the squad is going to be a **huge** need this window

*Edit:* I think Unai and the club need to look at the partnerships outwide - Rogers and Digne seem like a really good pairing, but I worry about Rogers infront of Maatsen as they're both very attacking and the Pairings on the Right hand side are all over the place and I think thats where a whole bunch of issues arise "
905,Aston Villa,yes 
906,Aston Villa,"I think our midfield depth is fine, unless Emery takes my advice and starts playing Tielemans in the no.10 position. He's generally been great in the pivot this season, but I agree he needs a partner with a big engine to cover him. Rogers and Buendia have been poor lately, give Tielemans a shot in that position. "
907,Aston Villa,"I doubt we would recall Enzo early or buy without selling first, but I do like your idea of a different player on loan. 

CM is where we are most stacked, on paper, yet every combination of them we've seen leaves a huge void in the middle that the opponent gets to run through freely. "
908,Aston Villa,"With how easy teams are getting through the cms in the last few games, I do think you have a point.


As good as barkely was in the last 25, in the first two thirds of the game schlupp and Hughes were slicing through the villa midfield. 


The one I'd be more interested in bringing back is Illing Jr. We are screaming out for some pace in the final third, and with Bailey struggling (although i thought he played well second half) and philogene really struggling going forward, I think id like to see more options. I think when we've gone two up top over the last 2 months it's absolutely killed us and cost us games. We need more options "
909,Aston Villa,"The more likely solution is more minutes for Kamara when he's fit. Onana needs to step up also, barring his first few games, I think he has underwhelmed. Ideally, yes of course. I just think because we're so clearly desperate to get Kamara back it's gonna backfire and he's gonna keep picking up these niggles. He had that spate of ankle injuries the year before where we tried to get him back and he'd be gone again after a couple of weeks. He missed 17 games in 22/23. That's a lot for someone you need in your side. It'd just be good if in the meantime, we had someone who could fit that role and we didn't have to rush him back.

Onana having that series of games where he got subbed off at half time (I think likely cos he got an early booking but it could've been fitness related) also indicated we were prob short in that area of one body. Disagree, Onana has had some excellent defensive games that just aren’t going to show up on the stats in the same way goals go. Look at his stats and he’s in the 90th+ percentile on several lines defensively. Same with shooting and goal creating actions. It’s really only his passing where he isn’t doing a lot but that takes time and that's Teilemans role. However his form has dipped a bit along with the entire team recently. He’s only a few games into the season and under Emery mind you as well, have to be patient. "
910,Aston Villa,"I suspect we didn't sign the two Juve players for ourselves, but for accounting reasons. Let's see and hopefully I am wrong.... Nope, you're absolutely right. Neither of those guys are any good, it's just most Villa fans don't want to face that truth. But look at the facts - Juventus wanted rid of both, we loaned both out immediately (just think about that... our thin squad that has been desperately calling out for depth, and we don't even take either player into the season), Iling barely even gets on the pitch for Bologna and Enzo plays sparingly for Valencia (who by the way are a terrible, relegation battling side). 

And then there are the counter arugments like ""Iling Jr is an u21 regular"". This one always makes me laugh, like it means he has some value. Nathaniel Chalobah, Nathan Redmond, Michael Mancienne, Steven Taylor. Know what all these players have in common? They're all in the top-10 for most England u21 caps of all time. Say no more.

""Enzo made the Argentina squad"" - he didn't even get on the bench 🤣 Literally just a filler call up because he has Juventus on his CV.

I get that we all want to believe that between Emery and Monchi, we only bring in high quality, high potential signings. But this transfer was complete PSR bullshit. We bundled in two assets we plan to sell-on in the near future to continue to find creative ways to dance around these ridiculous rules. They won't ever be good Villa players."
911,Aston Villa,McGinn got skinned by Palace yesterday. The sight of him chugging back to cover his mistake was painful to watch. 
912,Aston Villa,"Sooner or later, people are going to start realising we got completely hosed in the Luiz deal. The two players we got back are duds - they weren't wanted by Juventus, they're not good enough for us, and now they're backups at the teams we shipped them out to (and no, Enzo's Argentina ""call up"" doesn't mean anything). They won't ever be regular contributors for Villa. The whole deal was done for accounting purposes. Given Luiz’s form at Juve it’s hard to argue we were the ones who were hosed…"
913,Aston Villa,Wash your mouth out Calum Chambers!! Lol 
914,Aston Villa,"We also were licking our chops a few weeks ago when we had a ""fully fit"" squad again and now we're back to Ramsey, Onana and Kamara being out again. The main point is our midfield group is either overworked or injury prone, which isn't a great combo. "
915,Aston Villa,"I'm aware of his position, which is DM/CM. He's played mainly as a midfield two for Valencia. The point isn't about him specifically

They may be shortly returning, but the whole point of the post is I don't think you can rely on them to remain fit so we're not back to the same issue of a midfield duo/trio of Youri, Ross + McGinn. 

Kamara was injured for chunks of the season before coming back and doing his ACL. He's worked his way back on the bench to sub appearances and now has a knock again. Onana has started to pick up muscle injuries and once you start getting hamstring/calf injuries they tend to happen more frequently

Seems pretty clear we need an extra body in the midfield group given the frequency of injuries among them. Seeing as the squad is full, who are you kicking out for him?"

By January when this is even an option all these players are back and we are struggling to keep them playing well again have a young player not even on the bench (he missed out on the bench before Mings, Buendia and Kamara returned) the problem is we haven’t replaced Kamara and luiz in their winning the ball and keeping the ball.

Notice how much more we need to go long from the back because Luiz and Kamara aren’t there to receive the ball? 

We aren’t as good as we were and that is the aim of FFP or psr to keep us and anyone else from genuinely competing."

Unfortunately like you said, these players atm do need a massive engine when you've got no one sweeping up and we're constantly losing the ball. There's a reason teams are battering us on the counter. We're losing the ball too high up the pitch so need at least one of our midfielders to have the legs to get back. Barkley + Tielemans do not have that. Not for a full 90 all the time.

In those scenarios you've got a box of Pau, Carlos, Barkley and Tielemans running back and none are particularly quick. The whole giving up huge counter-attack chances at every corner situation highlights this a bit too, although that's mainly us over-committing with the personnel we have.

I agree we aren't as good as we were last year but that's understandable. We lost a big cog in Luiz and although he was a bit hit and miss with fans, Diaby seemingly brought the best out of Bailey and opened up things a bit more for Watkins. Onana does not replace the way Luiz played either"

Diabys pace was the final part of a puzzle, having that pace forced teams deeper on the transition and allowing space for those midfielders to play. Baileys loss of form has contributed to how we currently can’t play out. No one fears him getting on the ball. Him on form or Diaby just offering blistering pace would make so much difference. 

All in adding another untested at this level midfielder isn’t the answer. Kamara coming back would have helped hopefully his hamstring isn’t too serious. Onana and Tielemans together means we need to play a different way and I think that’s what we are trying to do but it isn’t/hasn’t been as effective.

In the same way Gueye was a good player, but just a shit team. Not saying he's better than Luiz in any way but he was an objectively good player (in that peak year of like 2013-14 and the year after) surrounded by some of the shittest players this club has ever seen. Bowery, Herd, Hogg, Lichaj, Kozak, Tonev, Helenius, Sylla, Bennett, Richardson. Christ, those squads were like the undateables of football. 

Anyway, back to present day. It does beg the question of the recruitment then given you've rightfully pointed out the ineffective shift in style due to the incomings and outgoings. Diaby was then never replaced. Think we've looked good on the break when Rogers has space to run into and can stretch their midfield. I think we've looked stuck if we've been playing slowly against a defensive block and we've needed Ramsey and Rogers to unlock defenses. Ramsey looked great in the past when given a similar role to Rogers. When he had space to run down the left and stretch defenders, that's when he was excellent. I don't think he's been particularly effective in this high-possession/cute passing style we've often tried to implement."

Not saying he's better than Luiz in any way but he was an objectively good player (in that peak year of like 2013-14 and the year after) surrounded by some of the shittest players this club has ever seen. Bowery, Herd, Hogg, Lichaj, Kozak, Tonev, Helenius, Sylla, Bennett, Richardson. Christ, those squads were like the undateables of football. 

Anyway, back to present day. It does beg the question of the recruitment then given you've rightfully pointed out the ineffective shift in style due to the incomings and outgoings. Diaby was then never replaced. Think we've looked good on the break when Rogers has space to run into and can stretch their midfield. I think we've looked stuck if we've been playing slowly against a defensive block and we've needed Ramsey and Rogers to unlock defenses. Ramsey looked great in the past when given a similar role to Rogers. When he had space to run down the left and stretch defenders, that's when he was excellent. I don't think he's been particularly effective in this high-possession/cute passing style we've often tried to implement. Delph was very much a part of that dreadful side, was overshadowed by Tom Cleverly! That side was saved by Benteke alone every season. Delph wouldn’t make the bench at current villa he was good at getting around the pitch and that was about it. Limited passing range and horrible defensively. 

Rogers running through teams (literally through because he doesn’t seem to even attempt to go round them) has been our only attempt at breaking the lines. I do think that it is a deliberate attempt at changing style, I think it needs some work and I trust in Unai to try, but I personally think we are significantly worse than last season. We don’t have the pace to stretch the pitch and it becomes congested in the middle. We need Bailey back on it (not replacing Diaby to have another option was in my mind a mistake) to have a wide option teams doubling up on him last season and the start of this season made space for others (Rogers the first 6 games this season). 

I think Ramsey back fit and going past people on the left with Rogers doing the same centrally and Bailey then doing Bailey things on the right we could have something really good. And that’s the problem…. 2 of that 3 are both out of form and not fit. We don’t have cover that offers anything close to their level. 

The other Diaby thing we didn’t replace was his speed when the ridiculous corner routine goes wrong. Go back last season and see how often he was last man and was quick enough to cut that out."
937,Aston Villa,"Ok so we sell them on and make a profit… how is that getting fleeced 🤦 Lol, for the third time: because they're not very good. You also realise we won't actually be making a profit, right?"

942,Aston Villa,"If i see cash on the lower ratings I will not be happy for this one.


I find barkley a hard one to grade. Brilliant last 20, really really poor before that. 


Youris worst game in a villa shirt and he ended with an assist. Couple of tough ratings this time. Bailey too. Atrocious first half but much better in the second half. Everyone gets a 1 until we win a game."
943,Aston Villa,"Starting XI (specifically that back four) was extremely poor. 

Thought Watkins had a very good game even if it was maddening when he was clear through and just wouldn’t take the shot.

Don’t say it often, but Cash was a revelation coming on at half time and was desperately needed. Helped Bailey kick it up a notch. 

I like Buendia and was gutted when he got injured, but since his return I don’t think I’ve seen him make a successful pass that wasn’t a two yard sideways one. The only thing he’s contributing to the team since his return is booking points. Agree on buendia for sure, but I will say his quick short passes did help up the tempo slightly when we were letting the game drift at the end, which happened anyway lol.


I think someone high up at Leeds was saying they tried really hard to bring him in on loan during the summer and villa said no. Genuinely think 6 months in the championship would have done him the world of good"
944,Aston Villa,"Couple of tough ratings this time. Bailey too. Atrocious first half but much better in the second half. I've been forced to become a Bailey defender this season, cause while he definitely hasn't played great, he hasn't been put in positions to succeed. The second half of the game he actually had space to attack and looked like a different player."

He’s capable of pushing himself without going elsewhere."

950,Aston Villa,There were times there tielemanns and Rodger were performing tricks the performance really didn’t warrant Most accurate thing I've seen today. Acting like we were 5-0 up at times. I know they were trying flicks like we were 3-0 up when we were chasing the game!
951,Aston Villa,"I think a lot of people are going to say we were poor in this one.

And they will be correct. "

953,Aston Villa,"70% possession and 3.18xg against a relegation side and we squeeze out a draw lol. Unbelievable.  Honestly 2 goals with ~3xg wasn’t t bad at all given our current form.. but yea embarrassing goals conceded and awful pen missed I think its very worrying that from 30% possession they've managed to have 16 shots.


Because he misskicked it and it looked funny maybe people didn't notice, but when they kicked off after the barkley goal, sarr is right in front of goal with a volley he should score. We didn't have any chance of note in those last 15 mins They had more shots on target than us and 1 of our shots was a penalty. Says everything really. 

Even in the last 6 minutes added time i think they had 2/3 chances and we created **maybe** 1? That's why stats mean fuck all."
954,Aston Villa,"I know a lot of yous don't like cash, but if he's fit, he needs to play. I'm all for playing youngsters, but playing one out of position was a disaster 


I'd love to have a proper conversation about Carlos without hearing ""bayern, arsenal, city"" as a response. He is the least reliable player. Today he did at least ten awful defensive things that weren't punished and he is atrocious on that first goal.

Thought barkley did better from 70-90, Bailey did okay second half.


Rogers and tielemans were woeful. The lack of anything when it went 2 2 was frustrating. They should have scored straight from kick off but sarr fluffed it I don’t dislike cash. I am of the opinion that if we want to step up a level he is a weak link. When we ARE playing well against good sides when we can hold our own he is usually the weak link that is targeted.

I’d keep him as a back up but we need an upgrade at right back. Carlos is good at what he does. If you're defending deeper and he's in a battle against someone, he'll probably do very well. If you're dominating the ball but needing to defend open spaces, Carlos ain't your man. >I'm all for playing youngsters, but playing one out of position was a disaster

I dont often question unai. But today i have to question what his fucking logic was. We had like 3 players on the bench capable of playing RB and we played someone out of position instead. 

The whole team set up was questionable and cost us imo."
955,Aston Villa,We didn't lose! 🥳 Stopped the rot 💪
956,Aston Villa,"Surley it's time to give Rodgers a rest. I love him as a player but would love to know what his ball retention rate was today. 

Unai will turn this around. Great perforce from Barkley!  UTV Barkley was the best player for us today for sure. He seemed like the only composed one out there. I'd be interested in dropping him to the bench for a few games, just to force our play out wide more. Throw teams off a bit.

Not Wednesday, though. I’d like to see him on the left again and move either McGinn or Tielemans to under Watkins. 

You can’t put a price on a quality CDM, without Kamara AND Onana we’re asking lads to play out of position. Neither Barkley or Tielemans have the legs to get back on the counter. 61% pass accuracy, 2 successful dribbles (out of 4 attempted), possession lost 20 times. 

As someone else pointed out he still had one key pass, nearly a 2nd, but I agree he probably needs a rest. I thought barkley was very good in the last 25 minutes. But before that him and youri were getting sliced through constantly. He shouldn't be in the no.10. if we had had Barkley, Tielemans, or McGinn in the 10 we would have won today easy.  I listened more so than watched the second half while doing some stuff around the apartment, how was buendia when he came on? And yet he was still key in creating two of the clear cut chances we had today."
957,Aston Villa,I hope Monchi has a rabbit to pull out of the hat in January and by that I mean not scouting Kazakhstan for U18 ballers. 
958,Aston Villa,"Condensed thoughts: 

Feel like we won’t see Bogarde again any time soon. Offered nothing once more.

Pau and carlos is an awful pairing. I don’t think replacing either of them with Mings improves it either. We need Konsa.

Cash was great today and I don’t think it was a coincidence that Bailey much better in the second half


Ross Barkley was sorely missed in the last few games. He’s quietly become a key member of the squad "
959,Aston Villa,"Very annoying game. Glad we got the point, and real happy for Barkley finding his shooting boots in the last couple games. A shame about the penalty which would have made the second half an entirely different affair. Maybe I'm projecting a little but it feels like there's a ""it's one of those games"" mentality that creeps into the squad a little to often for my liking and stops us driving on how we really should.  
  
But hey, feels like we always struggle against Palace these days, at least we actually got something from this one I guess. Still 3 points off third, and if 115 FC and West Ham can do us a solid then seventh to end GW11 isn't dreadful for now.   
  
Onto smashing Juve and then closing the gap to Chelsea next weekend. UTV "
960,Aston Villa,"Our transfer business is really biting us in the ass. Right back was always our biggest weakness and we did nothing to address it. Reminds me of the season we had to play Mellberg at RB. 

Cash made a huge difference when he came on. Not because he was amazing but because he was halfway decent and playing in the correct position. Bogarde is not a RB and Ned must be fucking awful in training. I think Ned is penalized for being a full international and not being at Bodymoor.  Woegarde is a horrible RB and Kieran Richardson has officially been unseated as the worst RB I’ve seen at Villa Park"
961,Aston Villa,"That was set up for us to win 5 or 6 today. They are a poor side, we were at home. 

But poor individual performances, horrible defending and a lack of composure in front of goal has allowed us to basically grab a draw from the jaws of a simple victory.

Players need to have a long look at themselves.
Emery needs to stop playing Bogarde. "
962,Aston Villa,"We were already shaky defensively and then over the international break we lost both our 6's and our top defender. I don't know what we expect to see in that state. Maybe we could put a couple of men back on corners Good point, well made!"
963,Aston Villa,"Feels like 2 points dropped but at least we didn’t lose. The goals we are conceding is very worrying, we cant allow teams to just cut through us with ease on the counter like we have been doing. Conceding after 4 minutes is just a joke.

We score the pen and we go in 2 1 up at ht and probably go on to win the game. We probably should have scored more than 2 but we just don’t seem to be able carve out good chances when we are around the box.

Watkins and Barkley both worked really hard all game, I actually thought Bailey was a lot better in second half. Buendia and philogene just don’t look like they are able to change the game when they come on and Duran didn’t do much either. We’re in a poor period just gotta hope we come out of it soon. "
964,Aston Villa,"Season over? No.

Top 4? Very unlikely now.

Top 7 probably realistic target.

We just look so flimsy at the back. When you are always chasing games you don’t consistently win 3 points.

Not good. Too many players just aren’t good enough. Top 6 was always going to be a success this season with CL fatigue, PSR restrictions and squad overhaul. 

I am not too worried that we concede. That's our football and why we score a lot. The missed penalty would potentially secure 3 points here. 

But it's blatantly obvious we are lacking a right side. We should remain realistic. Top 4 last year was great but the club is not at a place to be challenging there every year. Our goal should be European qualification in any form and deep cup runs. Anything beyond that is overachieving at the moment. Last point is such nonsense. They’re the exact same players that sealed 4th last year. Agree with the rest europe was still expected to be a result of a good year, next week vs chelsea is MASSIVE"
965,Aston Villa,"Our defense with any other keeper than Emi in the current form would concede 5 goals every game. Emi has a bottom 3 save percentage this season Emi honestly hasn't been amazing so far this season. Still great, but he's leaked through a couple goals that he probably should have saved If my auntie had a cock, she’d be my uncle"
966,Aston Villa,"For all the negativity (not unjustified), we still created more than enough to win the game. Watkins had two one on ones where he didn't get a shot away. Not to mention the penalty and other chances.

Were too easy to open up, hopefully Kamara helps there, and we aren't as fluent as we were last season, but we're not far off. "
967,Aston Villa,Diego Carlos out [deleted]
968,Aston Villa,"Frustrating result and performance. Feels like we're playing with a handicap because of the goals we are conceding.

Defensively we are poor. Offensively we are ok, but miles off what we were last season and that's what it took to get top 4. "
969,Aston Villa,"Although it’s frustrating in the context of the situation, the match itself wasn’t bad. Also, while Top 4 isn’t as likely as last season, it’s crazy to me people completely giving up hope on it whilst being only 3 points away. 

The same shit happened when we lost to Tottenham last season and everyone thought champions league qualification was over, yet we got it. 

Yes, be mad, hold the players accountable, but goddamn don’t give up hope on the entire season lol. Thank god most of our fans aren’t in any position at the actual club bc they’d just give up hope straight away It’s still so tight in the table, if we get right top 4 is definitely still in play If it’s any consolation, spurs keep losing to weak teams too.

At least we didn’t lose and Watkins scored. Maybe it’s the same up but defensively as we are shocking Don't get me wrong, I fully agree with this spirit! I do think too that we played fine (although not defensively, of course). It wasn't a shocking watch like the Brugge and Spurs matches were. But it is a bit more frustrating when taking into consideration the fact that it was against Palace, who are in the relegation zone. I mean, if we struggled against them, it doesn't feel exactly bright, and it was far from being the fresh restart we desperately needed after those last games. Got Juve on Wednesday and then Chelsea next week. Exhausting even if the team were in a good form. Really really wish we could recover and I believe in our club, just wish there was more to hold on to. 👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👌"
970,Aston Villa,We need to wake up before Juventus. And the fact I can even type that sentence says it all. We’ll be fine. 
971,Aston Villa,"This was a fun one. We had bags of possession, corners, shots. Conceded 2 counter attacking goals which was a bit shit but no risk, no reward and all that. Bring on Juve and the return of Dougie, should be a cracker! UTV! "
972,Aston Villa,"Our right side is a serious issue. Two RB on the bench yet we start with Bogarde who let's be honest isnt up to the standard we need. I get Cash is just getting back but Nedjelkovic is our back up RB but he isnt given a chance. Emery of course knows the players better but based on today he at least deserved a go.

Then Bailey who actually grew into the game but is still way low on confidence. Last season we had Diaby and it gave Bailey the chance to come off the bench and find form. This season we dont really have any other option because Philogene really doesnt look natural on that side and hasn't looked like Prem quality so far if I'm honest. Concerning going into the busy winter period. "
973,Aston Villa,"Guys, look at the bright side, Man City just lost 4-nill to spurs, so now they have a 5-game losing streak while we only have 4 losses and a draw! Also, we did manage to get one through spurs while City went goalless! In my books, it means we are better than the current title holders! /j (obviously, but anyways, always UTV💜🩵) "
974,Aston Villa,The positive is we created more chances in that match than the past month combined. The negatives is that our transitional defense continues to be swiss cheese. 
975,Aston Villa,"There was a time last season and the beginning of this when I wanted the top three to lose every game so we could stay close to them.

Now I’m back to wanting them to beat everybody else to help us in midtable. My mate was celebrating Brighton beating Citeh and I was like..."
976,Aston Villa,"I'm glad we were able to come from behind twice and that we didn't lose, but obviously this is a game they could have and should have won.  Hoping Konsa and Kamara will be fit again for the next game, I'd like to see the Mings/Konsa CB pairing back again (or really any pairing that doesn't involve Carlos). "
977,Aston Villa,We've improved a lot on rescuing points from losing positions at the very least 
978,Aston Villa,"Standouts from today imo: Barkley, obviously, was great and even more important, consistent. Watkins was in it too. Mccgin first half looked better than how he looked most of season so far. Bailey also. Still far from brilliant, but had his moments there and... wasn't woeful. It needs to be talked about. We naturally seek improvement, so we got to make sure as fans that we don't overlook those efforts. Found Pau impressive first half mainly considering that he basically had to carry alone this whole barley functioning defensive line. Him and Digne were our only decent defenders today. Talking about Digne, so far this season, he's been crucial to our game. Makes things go forward and very underrated for that. It was just felt when he wasn't there, especially during the beginning of the 2nd half. Unai probably wanted, reasonably, to save him for Juve, but it has to be pointed out! "
979,Aston Villa,"We weren't poor, but a significant drop off from last seasons performances. Teams can hit us on the break but we can't do that to opposition. Our starting fullbacks played well. Barkley put in a great performance plus goal. Watkins added to his England goal of a few days ago, really well taken. Bailey hit the upright and you shouldn't miss penalties. Buendia looked full of energy as did Digne when he came on. Negatives: sorry but I've seen enough of Philogene. Maybe Chelsea can pay crazy money for him, we can be easily hit on the break, VP isn't a fortress this season. "
980,Aston Villa,We really need to improve defensively if we're going to get into Europe again. At least a point is better than nothing. This defense feels like they let in 2 goals a game. Hard to get a lot of wins when 3 goals is a minimum. 
981,Aston Villa,"I would like to point out when Cash came back on we were a lot better...

...

...

It's almost as if...

...

Playing a right back...at right back

...

Is better than playing one of the best CB in the prem out of position. "
982,Aston Villa,Jesus some of the takes in here... 
983,Aston Villa,"Top 4 over absolutely give your head a fucking wobble you freaks.  12 games in and 3 points behind Jesus!

Some of you need to go back and watch us suffer to the likes of Preston on Tuesday nights. 
Long long way to go and plenty of football to be played.     Top 4 again would be a luxury 
top 7 is reasonable aslong as the club are playing some form of European football. "
984,Aston Villa,We might get first on MOTD now...every cloud'n all 
985,Aston Villa,"That was really shit, if we keep playing like that with the fixtures we have until the new year we can forget playing in Europe next year. "
986,Aston Villa,"aside from all the players who had an obviously bad game, there are so many making zero impact and just existing out there "
987,Aston Villa,We're almost as poor as Man City 
988,Aston Villa,"Serious questions need to be asked about the coaching that allows us to be cut open from our own set pieces over and over again. Simply not good enough, we don't look like a well coached team at all, our defense is an absolute disgrace. "
989,Aston Villa,"I think its hard but understandable what is happening with the team this season, Emery did a reset, neither Douglas Luiz nor Moreno are there, it is the first time I see Ramsey playing as a starter, it is the first time that Maatsen plays as a substitute for Digne, It is the first time that Onana and Tielemas play together...even Barkley...besides that Bayley is not in good shape and the same thing happens with McGin...too many changes in the team that you have to be patience. "
990,Aston Villa,"Emery has this good manager curse  
Getting the best of your player might hide the reality of the quality of the squad.  
Once key players get in poor form (Bailey a good example for this) the vicious circle starts.  
Even though Onana was a good pick the team needs at least 3 top signings to ensure stability in performances. "
991,Aston Villa,We look so easy to score against and the snail pace we play at going forward is getting really boring. 
992,Aston Villa,"Oliver Glasner: ""I told the guys before that how Villa play fits us perfect. They leave space and we knew we had a 2v1 (Sarr and Munoz) down that side and we always wanted to attack the gaps.""


Bit worrying.. no?

People talk about teams being ""found out"" tactically. I do wonder if that's happening  because apart from Bolonga and Bayern, it seems like every team has had a period of time where they exploit our weaknesses and take advantage Palace has always been a bit of a bogey team for us though"
993,Aston Villa,"All of a month, month and a half ago, Villa were genuinely one of the best teams in Europe.

Atm, we fail to beat Palace.

Clearly, there are issues with fast counters (not just this game). But, not a lot had to change.

We could have had 5 or more again today - and granted Palace could have been better too - and that has been the story regularly. So I think we'll come good again.


Hopefully before Xmas, because I lost more pennies on us today  🤣 I may ha e to revise my.policy of waiting until we concede and thn betting on us, ot hasn't worked lately!


That said, Unai will get it sorted. 

And let's be honest, a lot of us knew a rough patch was coming. VILLA HAVE A FULLY FIT SQUAD. Has there been been a more certain kiss of death to our progress than that over the decades? We weren't one of the best teams in Europe a month ago, come off it. We rose to the occasion in the CL magnificently in the first three games but we haven't been convincing domestically all season. We began the season needing a Duran rocket against this awful, awful West Ham side! how in just a few weeks do we go from everyone’s healthy to half the squad😭 fucking internationals Well hang on, we'd won some games in a European competition, we clearly weren't one of the best teams IN Europe."
994,Aston Villa,"Honestly an absolutely embarrassing performance. 


We are absolutely not finishing top 4, probably not in any European spots. 


This shit fucking league rewarded us for finishing 4th by forcing us to sell 2 of our best players. Whilst other fucking clubs who finished below is got to spaff £60m on an 18 year old whilst having £1bn of debt. 


On our performance, or high line seems to have disintegrated for literally no reason what so ever. We don't press in any sort of organised fashion leaving huge spaces that are so easy to play through. We then commit far too many players forward and lose the ball trying to overplay every little pass. It's actually fucking embarrassing. 


Palace without Eze. Fuck me. "
995,Aston Villa,"I'm really sick of Diego Carlos now. It feels like every time he has a run of good games where he saves the team he suddenly just costs us goals everywhere right after. Seems like with no Kamara or Onana, we just keep losing the ball midfield and then our backline can't deal with it.

When you play crap just don't lose, and at least we didn't lose. Some improvements from Bailey (imagine if he hit the target not woodwork with that shot), and his linkup with Cash was fine, but overall we still don't look like a threat against a good defensive structure and are not creating good enough chances. This might help us turn it around but won't help us nearly as much as a win would've. Am now dreading Juve and Chelsea, but at least after those we have kinder fixtures to try and turn things around... however I expect if we do salvage the season it'll come after January. "
996,Aston Villa,"Unfortunately, as Villa fans, if we want to progress we need to kill our darlings. We need to massively improve our squad. Not good enough again today, but at least we saved a point "
997,Aston Villa,I’ve forgotten what winning feels like 
998,Aston Villa,"At least we're not Man City. What are they doing?
And how is it possible to be as hot and then as cold as Spurs? 
Crazy"
999,Aston Villa,"Completely and inexcusably poor. We're ponderous, predictable, dull. When you can't single out individual performances then you've got to look instead at the manager. Eleven players don't all turn this bad overnight. I'll back Unai all the way back down to the Championship if it comes to it - but something has GOT to change. And quickly.  


Only Ollie, Bailey, Cash and Barkley seemed to have any real interest in winning that game. The rest are coasting or sulking. Dreadful stuff. Another way to look at it, maybe Unai overachieved with this group of players last season, and now they are regressing to the mean. Martinez definitely wanted us to win. Not sure I'd say the same about Bailey."
1000,Aston Villa,"Seemed like Cash specifically and maybe some of the rest of the team don’t really trust Philogene once he came on. He looks to be trying a bit too hard and ends up forcing 1v1s, losing the ball consistently and unnecessarily. Hopefully he can step up and grab a goal at some point but he’s been a solid downgrade from Diaby on that right side. "
1001,Aston Villa,How bad was Carlos today as well? He is just not on it at the moment.  
1002,Aston Villa,"we have a better squad this season no doubt, it just hasnt all come together. I hope that unai will get them firing. we are still in the hunt which is a positive "
1003,Aston Villa,"So I think we are seeing how we are struggling to adjust to life without Dougie and Moussa

Tielemans is great and comparable with Dougie on many levels, but he does try to make more Hollywood passes where Dougie was less inclined to go that way. 

I was gutted when moussa left, I was convinced he was going to have a blinding second season with us…but ok off he went. I partly see Bailey’s slump as a result of Moussa who provided friendly competition. I don’t think Jayden or Rogers have what he brought to the side. 

I think we just need to work with what we have. I’d like to see Rogers brought on as an impact sub for a couple of games "
1004,Aston Villa,"Ik Barkley scored, but watch the first goal conceded, if that is Onana or Kamara, they are either already in position or sprinting to recover position, two things that Tielemens and Barkley don’t do. Would of been tempted to play Bogarde at dm, for more central solidarity "
1005,Aston Villa,"We shouldn't have let up even a draw to a team who's gonna get relegated, it feels like we dont know what we are doing out there "
1006,Aston Villa,"[deleted] You'll get downvoted because it's not what people want to hear, but it's probably true. Finishing top 4 is not likely."
1007,Aston Villa,"Awful, profligate performance. Deeply immature against a frankly bad side.

- if McGinn really thinks he should still be the captain he needs to fucking step up and lead the team like one
- Carlos should not be starting when we have literally any other CB even half-fit
- Monchi has some serious questions to answer about why exactly an 18-year-old Serb kid whom Unai clearly doesn't trust was apparently the best use of very limited money at RB this summer, given that Bogarde is (and to be clear I have absolutely no ill feeling to him at all) clearly not up to the required level at the minute.
- I love Unai but he needs to get a grip on this soft, soft side at the minute. Too many senior players not pulling their weight. Bailey has been largely awful all season, I like Tielemans but he's badly off the boil, McGinn has his moments but his limitations are getting more and more obvious.

Onto the next one.  Bailey started the season with an injury, he’s been working up to last years efficacy. I thought he was a handful today. We have not other option - Jaden blows too and McGinn didn’t work out there either.  Didn't we get Nedeljkovic last year in January but loaned him back out? He was clearly seen as a project who ideally you'd have on loan but instead need as backup as at least half of our defence (Cash, Konsa, Mings, Carlos) are injury prone or have had seriously lengthy injuries in their careers. 

The bigger waste of money imo was Maatsen. He's clearly not a better alternative than Digne in the eyes of Emery, therefore is primarily backup. At which point, you had Alex Moreno who you've had to send out on loan. So we spent 45m on a backup LB that we already had at the club anyway. 

I also don't think we should've loaned out Barrenechea given McGinn, Barkley + Tielemans have some of the highest logged minutes for players of their age (Tielemans is a 27 year old with the minutes played of a 32-33 year old. In fact, he has way more matches/minutes than Barkley who is 30 and McGinn has monster minutes played for a 30 year old) and we have Kamara, Ramsey and Onana who all have had injury concerns. At the very least, we should've looked to reinforce that midfield area if the idea was relying on a core of Barkley, Ramsey, Kamara, Tielemans, Onana and McGinn and in most matches you're hoping to play 3 of them at the same time. We bought Kosta in January and loaned him back to the parent club. You know that Nedeljkovic wasn't signed last summer, right? We signed him last winter for less than ten million euros. I don't know why Emery is starting Bogarde over him when everyone with working eyes can tell Bogarde isn't a right back, but this was still relatively little money for a talented young player who could still have a strong future. > McGinn has his moments but his limitations are getting more and more obvious

this shit again"
1008,Aston Villa,"This is officially a crisis,
We appear to be getting worse.


Don't know what to make of it all,
Midtable mediocrity and a cup run ?


UTV It's not a crisis, it's poor form. Calm down."
1009,Aston Villa,"Most of us would have been happy to be 6th at this point. It’s just the fact we performed so well at the start of the season, I think the expectations have skyrocketed "
1010,Aston Villa,"Have watched Salah play 90 minutes 2x/week for a decade but Bailey can only play for 60 and we’re stuck with Jaden, who never does anything productive. What gives? I take the point about the fitness not being good enough but Salah is a huge outlier, it's why he's Salah. injury issues"
1011,Aston Villa,The summer window looks worse and worse every passing game. The less said about that Maatsen performance the better. 
1012,Aston Villa,"Robbed palace, fucking awful performance again only Watkins looked bothered. Emery you need to sort this out quick Watkins had two opportunities that I believe last season he’d have buried .. not questioning his talent, just don’t think it’s quite there atm."
1013,Aston Villa,"Digusting. The defence is sunday league level. Absolute chaos every time the opposition attacks. Lucky to have good players going forward to compensate, like it did in the beginning of the season. The luck has run out and the amount of compensation needed offensively is insane. Lucky to be upper-midtable in January playing like this. "
1014,Aston Villa,Woegarde 👎👎👎 
1015,Aston Villa,"The summer recuitment was poor and failed to improve what was badly required. 

Philogene is a mile off this level, in the end today the players didnt even want to pass to him and we lost all momentum the moment he came onto the pitch. The fact Bailey has returned to his usual level makes this decsion and killer for this team. 

And did  we really need to bring in Matteson when we had 2 decent left backs already at the club? When you look to the right full back  position, this becomes even bigger mistake. If we had fininical issues, surely this was not what should have been prioritised over bringing in a new left back? 

Our CM right now is not nearly as good as it was this time last year, regardless of who is available or not. Luiz is a huge loss. Onana in there isnt nearly as good. 

And finally our CB's , bar Konsa are just woeful defenders. 

I think its time to drop Pau for Mings because honestly are we really better off with him in the side? Does his passing ability really make up forthe fact he is a terrible and weak CB who is not suited to English football at all? >And did we really need to bring in Matteson when we had 2 decent left backs already at the club?

Are you talking about Moreno who, as it seems,  wasn't happy to fight for his position so he got a loan?

>I think its time to drop Pau for Mings

Really? The guy who made a fuck up against Palace and a schoolboy against Brugges? 

You think he'll be better after having no match practice for a year and a half? You think he'll be better and won't make more basic mistakes whilst getting back to match sharpness?

We're in a dip, we're having a bad run, we've been spoiled since Gerrard was sacked.

Even the mighty, unbeatable, Wank Shitty are on a run of four defeats in a row and are currently losing 1-0 to Spuds 🤷

(Make that TWO nil).

All teams have a bad run. With our players, compared to others at the top, we're very lucky to have not had a poor run before now."
1016,Aston Villa,"We need to stop with the three at back experiment. It may work in other Leagues, but unless you have Rodri covering your back line it won't work. We look so much better with a proper RB.

Rogers needs a rest now. He's great, but he's overdoing it and we aren't going to improve with tired players.

Bailey looks better with proper cover behind him, but he's still a shadow and we need to bring in better wingers now. Please Villa, go all out and get Baena in Jan.

We also need another CDM. We have to great ones, but they're both so unfit. We can't just hope they can stick it out.

Tielemans needs a break too. Maybe bring Luiz back in on loan?

Overall, a few tweaks and we'll be back to challenging for top four again. "
1017,Aston Villa,Most accurate thing I've seen today. Acting like we were 5-0 up at times. 
1018,Aston Villa,I know they were trying flicks like we were 3-0 up when we were chasing the game! 
1019,Aston Villa,Honestly 2 goals with ~3xg wasn’t t bad at all given our current form.. but yea embarrassing goals conceded and awful pen missed I wouldn’t say the penalty miss was awful. That was a great read and save by Henderson
1020,Aston Villa,"I think its very worrying that from 30% possession they've managed to have 16 shots.


Because he misskicked it and it looked funny maybe people didn't notice, but when they kicked off after the barkley goal, sarr is right in front of goal with a volley he should score. We didn't have any chance of note in those last 15 mins "
1021,Aston Villa,"They had more shots on target than us and 1 of our shots was a penalty. Says everything really. 

Even in the last 6 minutes added time i think they had 2/3 chances and we created **maybe** 1? 5 shots to 6."
1022,Aston Villa,"That's why stats mean fuck all. Not at all. They mean a lot of things. They don’t mean who gets points though, correct."
1023,Aston Villa,"I don’t dislike cash. I am of the opinion that if we want to step up a level he is a weak link. When we ARE playing well against good sides when we can hold our own he is usually the weak link that is targeted.

I’d keep him as a back up but we need an upgrade at right back. "
1024,Aston Villa,"Carlos is good at what he does. If you're defending deeper and he's in a battle against someone, he'll probably do very well. If you're dominating the ball but needing to defend open spaces, Carlos ain't your man. The thing is, there are examples, as I said, city, arsenal bayern of him playing well.


But I could name as many bad performances against that level of team, he was bad against Liverpool, atrocious in the city away game last year. 


I'd say... he's good at what he does (sometimes)

Imagine being fulham and nearly signing him and ended up with Anderson instead. I'd take that any day of the week"
1025,Aston Villa,">I'm all for playing youngsters, but playing one out of position was a disaster

I dont often question unai. But today i have to question what his fucking logic was. We had like 3 players on the bench capable of playing RB and we played someone out of position instead. 

The whole team set up was questionable and cost us imo. "
1026,Aston Villa,Stopped the rot 💪 At least we're not as bad as Man City. 
1027,Aston Villa,Barkley was the best player for us today for sure. He seemed like the only composed one out there. 
1028,Aston Villa,"I'd be interested in dropping him to the bench for a few games, just to force our play out wide more. Throw teams off a bit.

Not Wednesday, though. Can't play Ramsay though, that leaves Buendia."
1029,Aston Villa,"I’d like to see him on the left again and move either McGinn or Tielemans to under Watkins. 

You can’t put a price on a quality CDM, without Kamara AND Onana we’re asking lads to play out of position. Neither Barkley or Tielemans have the legs to get back on the counter. Yes, totally agree. Rodgers just isn't that effective in the 10, even though he shows flashes. He doesn't contribute much defensively, loses the ball consistently, and also makes incorrect decisions at key moments. Don't get me wrong, he is a good player, but we are suffering with him in no.10, especially when we need wide players, given injuries and loss of form.  McGinn wasn't able to deal with their pace today. He's a club legend, but I think it's time for them to reassess his position."
1030,Aston Villa,"61% pass accuracy, 2 successful dribbles (out of 4 attempted), possession lost 20 times. 

As someone else pointed out he still had one key pass, nearly a 2nd, but I agree he probably needs a rest. Lost possession 20 times?? That's mental. 


I've said it on here before, but I feel like he took the wrong lessons from the buzz of the arsenal game. I was impressed with the pass through to watkins, not the dribbles that ended up with him losing possession. Now every time he gets the ball and goes head first into a crowd of players Sure Buendia had one key pass within 10 seconds of coming on. "
1031,Aston Villa,I thought barkley was very good in the last 25 minutes. But before that him and youri were getting sliced through constantly. 
1032,Aston Villa,"He shouldn't be in the no.10. if we had had Barkley, Tielemans, or McGinn in the 10 we would have won today easy.  "
1033,Aston Villa,"I listened more so than watched the second half while doing some stuff around the apartment, how was buendia when he came on? "
1034,Aston Villa,And yet he was still key in creating two of the clear cut chances we had today. 
1035,Aston Villa,I think Ned is penalized for being a full international and not being at Bodymoor.  Woegarde is a horrible RB and Kieran Richardson has officially been unseated as the worst RB I’ve seen at Villa Park 
1036,Aston Villa,Maybe we could put a couple of men back on corners 
1037,Aston Villa,"Good point, well made! "
1038,Aston Villa,"Top 6 was always going to be a success this season with CL fatigue, PSR restrictions and squad overhaul. 

I am not too worried that we concede. That's our football and why we score a lot. The missed penalty would potentially secure 3 points here. 

But it's blatantly obvious we are lacking a right side. I agree except it is why we USED to score a lot.  Not so much this season from open play."
1039,Aston Villa,We should remain realistic. Top 4 last year was great but the club is not at a place to be challenging there every year. Our goal should be European qualification in any form and deep cup runs. Anything beyond that is overachieving at the moment. 
1040,Aston Villa,"Last point is such nonsense. They’re the exact same players that sealed 4th last year. Agree with the rest Ok, rephrase. A few aren’t. Philogene is bottom half of prem team at his absolute best. 

Bogarde isn’t good enough.

Carlos as well has cost us too many times. [deleted] Are you sure that's not Leon's long lost evil twin brother out there? I agree, we can't just say, players fault when we lose and it's all unai when we win Genuinly, what is the problem then? Is it on Emery? Yeah and the majority of them outperformed their capabilities asking that for a second season in a row was unrealistic and their limitations is catching up to them. Especially as Emery has changed the way we play to a more possession-based style which isn't favoring our forwards who look far more comfortable playing a higher tempo on the transition."
1041,Aston Villa,"europe was still expected to be a result of a good year, next week vs chelsea is MASSIVE "
1042,Aston Villa,"Emi has a bottom 3 save percentage this season We would've conceded 5 today if it wasn't for Emi. In every game I've watched, he's been pretty solid. He can't save in 2v1 situations that the absolutely miserable central defense has been putting him in this season."
1043,Aston Villa,"Emi honestly hasn't been amazing so far this season. Still great, but he's leaked through a couple goals that he probably should have saved Aside from the Champions League oddly?? Still no goals conceded from open play there... wish we could get that Emi in the Prem"
1044,Aston Villa,"If my auntie had a cock, she’d be my uncle Well, check it out"
1045,Aston Villa,"[deleted] No need. I want him gone and have for a while, because he's clearly not good enough to play here consistently and is presumably on too much money to sit on the bench all season, but it's not like there's any evidence he's a bad influence"
1046,Aston Villa,"It’s still so tight in the table, if we get right top 4 is definitely still in play "
1047,Aston Villa,"If it’s any consolation, spurs keep losing to weak teams too.

At least we didn’t lose and Watkins scored. Maybe it’s the same up but defensively as we are shocking They're 2-0 up against citeh. Checks out which other 'weak' teams have we lost to? I must have missed it"
1048,Aston Villa,"Don't get me wrong, I fully agree with this spirit! I do think too that we played fine (although not defensively, of course). It wasn't a shocking watch like the Brugge and Spurs matches were. But it is a bit more frustrating when taking into consideration the fact that it was against Palace, who are in the relegation zone. I mean, if we struggled against them, it doesn't feel exactly bright, and it was far from being the fresh restart we desperately needed after those last games. Got Juve on Wednesday and then Chelsea next week. Exhausting even if the team were in a good form. Really really wish we could recover and I believe in our club, just wish there was more to hold on to. "
1049,Aston Villa,👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👌 
1050,Aston Villa,Would have thought Digne given his form arguably in the form of his life.. surley just managing his fitness going into the christmas period Saving him for Juve
1051,Aston Villa,"That back line doesn’t give me a massive amount of confidence Bogarde and Carlos doesn't scream clean sheets. We’re cooked lmao, Palaces attackers will rip that backline to pieces. Good thing is palace can't finish for shit."
1052,Aston Villa,Nice to see Ben Broggio on the bench. Seems to be highly rated in the academy and seen his name pop up a fair bit recently aswell. 
1053,Aston Villa,"Bah god... the return of Bogarde! And Maatsen starts. Wow. Expecting that to be a properly lopsided back four with in that case.


Anyone else hoping we'll play Mings and Pau alongside eachother one day? I know two left footers feels weird but plenty of teams do it with two right footers...  Back 3 basically"
1054,Aston Villa,Made the Gary Neville “OooOooOh” sound when I saw that backline 😭 😂
1055,Aston Villa,Bogarde and Maatsen? Well I'm intrigued. Injuries have forced a change but at least it's something different. Remember in the summer when we all wanted to have two dutch full backs? Here we go!
1056,Aston Villa,"Listen... Bogarde is actually defensively solid, it's just his attacking that's not great and if I'm totally honest it doesn't give me hope for the right hand side at all going forward. 

Carlos is a toss up we all know he can be and lets be real, before our little run of bad games, he was really really good.

Also great to see Barkley back.

Overall, I think we should be winning this and if we don't I think it's time to start asking questions about our strategy going forward ESPECIALLY if the right side is flaccid again > Bogarde is actually defensively solid, it's just his attacking that's not great and if I'm totally honest it doesn't give me hope for the right hand side at all going forward.


I actually really rate Bogarde. I am not even sure why he was taken off today. He isn't going to risk as much as Cash going forward as he is young, and feeling his way into the Premier League. In reality, he isn't even a right back, so some credit due to him. I think there is a future for him in the middle. "
1057,Aston Villa,Where Boubs? Minor injury apparently
1058,Aston Villa,"I think this game will really indicate where we’re due to finish this season.

We simply should not be losing this game even with Bogarde having to start.

If we win today I think we can still be optimistic of aiming for Europe. But to lose this game today will be absolutely catastrophic. It will be shit to lose today but catastrophic is some massive hyperbole. lose or draw. Palace are awful and have no strikers. Their 0 is nearly guaranteed. If it's 0-0 we're cooked."
1059,Aston Villa,"McGinn is the most defensive player outside of the actual defenders, this might be a basketball game Leon Bailey is a very good defensive player for the opposition this season tbf."
1060,Aston Villa,We’re going to need to take our chances. We keep getting the first chance of the game and not taking it. That’s a reversal of most of last season. 
1061,Aston Villa,"I’m looking forward to seeing Bogarde, I thought he done well the last couple games he started. 
Also excited to see maatsen too. "
1062,Aston Villa,Oof. 
1063,Aston Villa,Hoping for a big performance. Hopefully we can get the 3 points today. 
1064,Aston Villa,"I'm genuinely baffled as to why Kosta isn't starting in place of Bogarde. Whatever little we've seen of them, Kosta's been miles clear I agree based on the sample size I’ve seen"
1065,Aston Villa,All their attacking threat will be on our right then 
1066,Aston Villa,"I really hope its Rodgers on the left, Bailey on the right and Barkley in the 10, with McGinn and Tielemans behind. I mean, it has to be right? "
1067,Aston Villa,Oh no... 
1068,Aston Villa,"3 at the back with Maatsen bombing on I'm ok with.
We should be able to pick someone out the crowd to play in defence and still be beating CP with our attacking options ( I'm exaggerating but you get my point )
UTV  "
1069,Aston Villa,I have to believe that Bogarde is the answer 
1070,Aston Villa,"Don't really get the point of having two RBs on the bench. If you're resting Cash, then fine, but why even bother with Nedeljkovic if you've given Bogarde the nod? If you want Bogarde as cover if Tielemans/Barkley get injured or tired then surely start Nedeljkovic so you have fresher legs in the middle? "
1071,Aston Villa,"So basically, it's three at back with Maatsen playing advanced and coming back when on defence. "
1072,Aston Villa,Digne should have started 
1073,Aston Villa,Need to get mings in that defence we can't keep going behind this is costing us big time. 
1074,Aston Villa,Carlos again!? What has he got on Emery? Fucking nudes? 
1075,Aston Villa,arguably in the form of his life.. surley just managing his fitness going into the christmas period In Emery we trust
1076,Aston Villa,Saving him for Juve 
1077,Aston Villa,Bogarde and Carlos doesn't scream clean sheets. Considering we've had 1 clean sheet in the prem i dont think any of our back lines do
1078,Aston Villa,"We’re cooked lmao, Palaces attackers will rip that backline to pieces. You got downvoted for telling the uncomfortable truth"
1079,Aston Villa,Good thing is palace can't finish for shit.

Losing is absolutely unacceptable today. All of that has been obvious already. We're simply not as good as last season. I still don't think it means 'catastrophe' in November when down to 7th gets some form of Europe competition. Relax, we’ve got one of the best coaches in the world.  We’ll likely beat teams with more expensive squads than us and also lose to teams with cheaper squads. 

If it’s “unacceptable” that means something has to happen if we lose. What do you suggest? 

Getting in that state of mind will make it impossible for you to enjoy the football. Just a constant state of disappointment we’re not playing 10 out of 10 football."

1107,Aston Villa,"Bailey started terribly, but I think we saw some green shoots from him today. Yeah, he is comfortable with cash. "
1108,Aston Villa,"Honestly thought Bailey did well today. Maybe average overall but that’s far better than he has been. He’s not gonna play back into form in 1 game. Tielemans looked terrible, possibly his worst game for us from the moment he hit the post he started playing well"
1109,Aston Villa,"Watkins deserved that, been fighting all game "
1110,Aston Villa,I guess I’ll take the point with the way we’ve been playing 
1111,Aston Villa,"Really frustrating performance, it’s 2 points lost. Serious worries over our defence and the lack of control and cohesiveness of our midfield. At least we’ve stopped the losing streak, but it’s simply not good enough at the moment. "

1115,Aston Villa,Pau's pass to McGinn... Holy shit that was eye of the needle stuff 
1116,Aston Villa,"Say what it like about baileys form, it’s not for lack of effort "
1117,Aston Villa,Missing the pen then conceding from our own corner again is a killer. I dunno what we can change but we gotta stop conceding goals where we’re just cut through like both off their goals today 
1118,Aston Villa,Rogers and tielemans think they’re playing fifa street 😭😭 can we stop with the fancy flicks and passes they aren’t working 
1119,Aston Villa,"Corners: villa 10 - 1 palace

Goals scored from corners: villa 1 - 1 palace "
1120,Aston Villa,Such a completely painful watch. Awful. Genuinely think only Ollie and potentially Barkley can hold their heads up and say they've played well today. Cash decent enough since he came on too - but the rest are either sleeping or just aimless. 
1121,Aston Villa,Unreal.  Tielemans missed 4/6 last penalties and then to concede 
1122,Aston Villa,"Why do we have all 10 players up at corners? This happened multiple times against Liverpool, and we still doing it? "
1123,Aston Villa,Conceding on our own attacking corners is happening way too often. Too focused on coming up with clever plays is leaving us exposed 
1124,Aston Villa,"In other news, ollie's now the first player to ever be involved in 50+ goals in Villa Park. 35 goals and 15 assists at home *since 1992"
1125,Aston Villa,It's a minor miracle we're still only 3 points off third in this form. 
1126,Aston Villa,Forgot about the +20 to all stats keepers get playing against us 
1127,Aston Villa,Not a bad placed shot really 
1128,Aston Villa,"Thank God for Barkley. Shouldn't have missed penalty. Weren't terrible, positives we do have alternative full backs, Watkins scores, 70% possession. Negatives, suseptible to the break, few attempts on goal, no capable penalty taker, no win in 5. "
1129,Aston Villa,Ok well that couldn’t have gone any worse 
1130,Aston Villa,and for the briefest of moments i was thinking i didn’t miss dougies slow little shuffle to take the penalty 
1131,Aston Villa,"Seriously just don't give us corners

Give them a goal kick because maybe then we will have defenders in our own half. PEOPLE TOOK THE PISS OUT OF SPURS LAST SEASON FOR THE SAME SHIT WERE DOING NOW. "
1132,Aston Villa,"had a golden opportunity to regain the momentum with that penalty but somehow made it worse


Tielemans had 2/5 on penalties and missed his last one for Belgium, so why does he take it? Tielemans is 24/31 career on Pens"
1133,Aston Villa,"https://preview.redd.it/etc9rqbmdo2e1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=892000eb396d3293c52be0a32f29d81aab92ba8f

CMON "
1134,Aston Villa,Tielemans worst game this season 
1135,Aston Villa,[deleted] 
1136,Aston Villa,"God i need to stop coming villa park, fucking painful this is 🙈 "
1137,Aston Villa,"I'm starting to really not like the defensive structure. Tielemans and Barkley were just not covering anything centrally, the gap between them and the defence was huge "
1138,Aston Villa,Here's a bit of space opening up...\*gets excited\*...for Leon Bailey...\*immediately loses excitement\* 
1139,Aston Villa,Bailey needs to be nowhere the starting Line-up. Man Cant even control a ball. 
1140,Aston Villa,Buendia and philogene should be starting ahead of Bailey at this point 
1141,Aston Villa,Leon is so low on confidence 
1142,Aston Villa,Praying Leon gets a bit of confidence off that shot He was smiling there. Not seen that for a long time 😊
1143,Aston Villa,"Hopefully that inspires Bailey a bit more. Unlucky to miss, great effort. "
1144,Aston Villa,Our annual pen and we missed it 😢 
1145,Aston Villa,"lol I fucking knew it, we have absolutely no one who can take a pen "
1146,Aston Villa,"That wasn't a shot lads, that was a clearance because we'd just taken a corner "
1147,Aston Villa,"Fair play bailey, you've stepped up this half "
1148,Aston Villa,"Tielmans / McGinn / Barkley is rough - more speed and intensity in midfield on my Sunday league team. Individually decent players, but together as a midfield 3? Oof. 


Throw in consistently poor Carlos, Bailey, and Bogarde, and this is a team closer to relegation places than Champions League.


Cherry on top, Maatsen has been embarrassed by Sarr as well. "
1149,Aston Villa,Our defence treats Mateta like he's an actual fucking tank... Like with treads and a turret and not a metaphorical tank 
1150,Aston Villa,"Ball there from Leon

Praise as loud as criticism I’m still hoping with one assist or goal his confidence will come back Absolutely. He's had moments"
1151,Aston Villa,"Can we fix our defending following a corner? It was abysmal vs Liverpool, Palace are half the football team as pool and we still can't stop the counter. "
1152,Aston Villa,Point gained but FFS that was so winnable 
1153,Aston Villa,"lol, Bailey has done nothing this season except run straight into defenders "
1154,Aston Villa,Watkins simply has to score goals for this team to reach its potential man 
1155,Aston Villa,"When you look at the build up structure and what Emery wants his sort of hybrid RB to achieve, I actually think Bogarde has consistently shown he understands the positioning and tactical instructions. He's still just a bit too nervy and inexperienced to always execute it particularly well. But I can see why Emery goes for him. Just wish he had Mings next to him to back up his lack of muscle He needs to get stronger. He's shown aggression and awareness well but physically doesn't quite have the guts to play at this level imo"
1156,Aston Villa,PURE VILLA. FFS 
1157,Aston Villa,Did nobody tell Palace it's our birthday? Party poopers. 
1158,Aston Villa,Really nothing has changed since the break. Defensively just pure Swiss cheese 
1159,Aston Villa,Well at least this feels more like the Villa I know… 
1160,Aston Villa,What is there to say? I'm just incredibly disappointed. The awful defence just sucks the life and the enjoyment out of you. 
1161,Aston Villa,"We need a serious penalty taker, youri has missed too many for Belgium as well "
1162,Aston Villa,We’re back to that period where we have to score three goals every game to win the match. It’s unsustainable. 
1163,Aston Villa,Will it eventually get to the point where our players appeal for a goal kick to the opposition rather than a corner for us? A kind of reverse Rory Delap. 
1164,Aston Villa,Maatsen could easily have been sent off there. The ref and VAR are giving us every benefit and we're stinking up the place. 
1165,Aston Villa,"When it comes down to it, we just aren't putting in the necessary effort. Tactics can put players in the right positions, but you still need to win your matchups and we just don't win 50/50s. The amount of fast breaks we've given up off of our own free kicks and turnovers are down to effort. 

As I'm typing this up, we've just leveled the score on a set piece which has been our most consistent way to score, but my point remains. "
1166,Aston Villa,Actually thought second half Bailey did well 
1167,Aston Villa,Sadly looking like a mid table team 
1168,Aston Villa,"Watching Diego Carlos play is like watching a sloth try to fuck a coconut, slow and unnatural  Your search history must be a fascinating read He’s honestly maybe the biggest problem with the entire team imo Lol"
1169,Aston Villa,"I 100% get why we do the thing when we slow it down, but, in those first 6 months with unai we used to start really really quickly and score early "
1170,Aston Villa,Great I’m behind but they already scored haven’t they 
1171,Aston Villa,Woeful defending yet again. Where’s the pace and urgency to track back? Where’s the intensity to press to get the ball back? 
1172,Aston Villa,Mission Impossible 8: Villa Clean Sheet 
1173,Aston Villa,"Bailey is woeful, last year was an outlier. What use is a pacy winger if they won't use their pace? "
1174,Aston Villa,Bailey has no belief in himself. 
1175,Aston Villa,Our right side has been non-existent all season. Its too easy for teams to predict us. 
1176,Aston Villa,I am not one to dogpile on players when they're struggling. But I think my confidence in Bailey is gone for good. He just doesn't have it this season 
1177,Aston Villa,"Everything just feels off, the weight of passes, the timing of runs, the positioning. Everything just feels a  beat behind it's so bizarre "
1178,Aston Villa,Wow. Some save that. There's more goals in this. Come on boys. 
1179,Aston Villa,"In the two mins before that goal, ollie made about 5 different runs and resetting. Keeps making the runs again and again 


Gets his rewards. Legend "
1180,Aston Villa,How does Pau Torres somehow look even hotter? Hair drenched. Oozing handsomeness. 
1181,Aston Villa,Bias aside that should be a pen 
1182,Aston Villa,"Oh yeah, forgot about the +20 goalkeeper stat against us "
1183,Aston Villa,"of course, why wouldn't you expect a missed pen and then go a goal behind "
1184,Aston Villa,There are very big questions to be asked regarding the defence and what is actually happening. 
1185,Aston Villa,We are being beaten by hoof ball and ourselves. 
1186,Aston Villa,Our defence is very worrying. This is relegation defence. 
1187,Aston Villa,No more corners please. 
1188,Aston Villa,"Feels like 75 percent of our conceded goals this year are against the run of play, so back breaking "
1189,Aston Villa,Time after time after time after time we are our own worst enemy. We play beautifully at times and then a stupid individual mistake undoes it all. 
1190,Aston Villa,Maybe Bailey's just more comfortable having cash behind him. Leaves him more free to possibly make mistakes maybe 
1191,Aston Villa,"Barkley and tielemans, tielemans in particular, have given the ball away a lot "
1192,Aston Villa,There’s just not enough energy in our movement. Taking too many touches in the final third. Play a pass first time and TRY to create something ffs 
1193,Aston Villa,"How is that a free kick, they played on???? "
1194,Aston Villa,They’ve played the advantage already what the fuck? 
1195,Aston Villa,"Watkins, just take the fucking shot on "
1196,Aston Villa,Great save by emi 
1197,Aston Villa,"That was a firm ""HURRY THE FUCK UP"" whoever shouted that "
1198,Aston Villa,"Blows my mind that a striker doesn’t take penalties. It’s like an electrician refusing to change the batteries in the remote. You’re not going to get an easier opportunity to do your job. Blows my mind a striker can be bad at penalties. Watkins is 4/9 career Pena, know the facts Seriously, Watkins or Rogers should've taken"
1199,Aston Villa,We desperately need a backup for youri. Completely reliant on him 
1200,Aston Villa,"Near Witton station just after the game. A black car hit two guys who were walking to the station post game. Witton station is a mess. Police do nothing to help control the traffic there. Last game i saw a bloke in the middle of the street screaming and shouting waving a bat to get people to move so his mate could drive through the crowds. That helps. Nope, still didn't see it.

>A black car hit two guys

Hang on, your post says he ran over them? Bit of a difference between hitting them and running over them.

Whichever it was I hope they're well."
1201,Aston Villa,"Always makes me a little nervous, so many people in the road. "
1202,Aston Villa,Whereabouts? 
1203,Aston Villa,"[Mirror article on the incident](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-villa-park-hit-run-34177558).  Apparently he mounted the pavement and hit this woman as she pushed her 85-year-old nan out of the way... Says they're still looking for him, but I'd be stunned if they can't identify him with all the CCTV around a Premier League football ground. "
1204,Aston Villa,I did see the car go through the crowd didn't realise it hit someone 
1205,Aston Villa,So we’re people hit? Or ran over? Bit of a difference considering speed must have been low for the most part. 
1206,Aston Villa,"That's a tad vague.

I'm in London and didn't see any accident 🤷 Congratulations. no shit sherlock"
1207,Aston Villa,Witton station is a mess. Police do nothing to help control the traffic there. Last game i saw a bloke in the middle of the street screaming and shouting waving a bat to get people to move so his mate could drive through the crowds. 
1208,Aston Villa,"That helps. Nope, still didn't see it.

Whichever it was I hope they're well. "
1209,Aston Villa,Congratulations. 
1210,Aston Villa,no shit sherlock 
1211,Aston Villa,See you on the roof in five minutes? 
1212,Aston Villa,"Make sure you stop at Witton Arms, enjoy your time there. Villa is a proper football team for any visitor. I was there in October for champions game vs bologna It’s now on the list !"
1213,Aston Villa,"For full match day experience you need to get a burger with plenty of fried onions from one of the food vans on the way to the ground. 


Make sure to give a little hello to your seat neighbours, and in L6 I'd imagine you'll be standing up for most of the match. Don't expect much in terms of refreshments at half time as the queues are awful & remember you're not allowed to take beers into actual seats themselves.


Have a great day! Already starving.  And yes, the no beer in the stands is quite the bummer. Guess I’ll have my fill outside"
1214,Aston Villa,"Should post on the [Villa North America Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/113197252080708). Might be another yank or two over for the game, often is. Thank you I will check that out too"
1215,Aston Villa,"Have a great time! I'm a brit that's just moved out to the USA, I have to (hopefully) get up and go to a pub for 7am tomorrow, we better win! That is how I spend every match day in Portland, Oregon !"
1216,Aston Villa,"Sorry, I read that completely wrong there. A ""yank"" can mean something completely different in my vocab! 😂 A bit too rainy for one of those at the park I’m afraid"
1217,Aston Villa,Aston inn is better than the witton imo. Bit the witton is still a grid laugh. Fan zone is decent as well. I'm in L2 lower is a good atmosphere. I’d heard about the Aston Inn. Will I see you there?
1218,Aston Villa,"I’m not sure how this commenting works if everyone sees it, but thank you to all for the suggestions and the well wishes. It was truly a special day. Aside from not being a win, I couldn’t ask for a better time. Ollie takes that pen we win it… all is well. We move. UTV "
1219,Aston Villa,Enjoy the game pal UTV. 
1220,Aston Villa,"I usually travel up on my own from the south if I go, give me a message next time you’re over and I’ll happily show you about! :) "
1221,Aston Villa,I genuinely thought someone was promoting the fact he had a solo yank at villa park till I read it 
1222,Aston Villa,[deleted] I didn’t come all this way to sit! UTV!!!
1223,Aston Villa,Let’s us know how it went 
1224,Aston Villa,Solo Wank was how I read it 😂😂
1225,Aston Villa,"👍Make sure you’re clear that us 🇺🇸 also despise what Chris Heck is trying to pull.  A London business plan will not thrive in Birmingham, and certainly when our form isn’t 🔥 "
1226,Aston Villa,It’s now on the list ! 
1227,Aston Villa,"Already starving.  And yes, the no beer in the stands is quite the bummer. Guess I’ll have my fill outside "
1228,Aston Villa,Thank you I will check that out too 
1229,Aston Villa,"That is how I spend every match day in Portland, Oregon ! I should already be asleep.... Another PDX Villan here, is there a good pub you go to?"
1230,Aston Villa,A bit too rainy for one of those at the park I’m afraid Have a great day. Hoping for a big win for us. UTV!
1231,Aston Villa,I’d heard about the Aston Inn. Will I see you there? 
1232,Aston Villa,I didn’t come all this way to sit! UTV!!! 
1233,Aston Villa,😂😂 
1234,Aston Villa,I should already be asleep.... I know how it goes. Set several alarms…
1235,Aston Villa,"Another PDX Villan here, is there a good pub you go to? "
1236,Aston Villa,Have a great day. Hoping for a big win for us. UTV! 
1237,Aston Villa,I know how it goes. Set several alarms… 
1238,Aston Villa,"You can just send the ticket to anyone you like. I literally did it ten minutes ago as I can't make it so I've sent it to my partner.

If he downloads it to his wallet he can then share it from there. Nice one thanks!"
1239,Aston Villa,"I'm glad you've asked this question. I've got 2 tickets and can no longer get to the game (just got out of hospital with pneumonia). I understand tickets are non-refundable. I'm hoping if I call them they'll be able to put them up for resale, otherwise I'll be looking to sell them here which is not something I'd really like to do because it's hard to avoid being conned\\people thinking they aren't being conned. Fingers crossed. "
1240,Aston Villa,"If you meet the purchase requirements for the game, and the window the ticket was bought, your mate can DM the twitter account AVFC Support "
1241,Aston Villa,Nice one thanks! 
1242,Bournemouth,"My hot take this week is that Ryan Christie is indispensable in the midfield. Without him we leak like a sieve. Thoughts? We definitely missed Christie massively, his press and attack are also vital to creating chances."
1243,Bournemouth,"We definitely missed Christie massively, his press and attack are also vital to creating chances. "
1244,Bournemouth,"Maybe he just wants to get Huijsen minutes. Can't be fun being on the bench every week and never getting on, particulalry if AI rates Huijsen as better than the rest of the subs. Makes sense to keep him involved and feel likenhe is contributing. 
I've also been thinking that there's a chance Zab/Marcos get sold in the window and he wants Dean to be involved as he will be the next guy in line? "
1245,Bournemouth,"Usually after Senesi gets a yellow card. He's dangerously close to 5 now, which would mean his absence for a whole match. Semenyo got his 5th yesterday, we're without him at Wolves.

I didn't think Huijsen did too badly yesterday, we didn't let another in after he came on. Senesi has been a little off form lately, not his usual boisterous self. Possibly due to him being all loved up? "
1246,Bournemouth,"Senesi hasn't had a good couple of last games. Distribution wise, which along with his stepping out to block has been very poor compared to his usual standards. 

I really rate Marcos, but I think he deserved to be subbed in the last 2 games, and should be sweating over whether he starts the next game. "
1247,Bournemouth,genuinely I think it’s cause he feels bad that he’s not getting any minutes 
1248,Bournemouth,"Huijsen adds a threat at set-pieces due to his height. He's also very progressive on the ball and attempts ambitious passes - when you have five subs, you may as well make changes if the status quo isn't working. I think this is the answer that makes most sense. Cant believe people are trying to say he’s come on because he needs minutes and Iraola feels bad. That’s not how football works??!!!"
1249,Bournemouth,Huijsen needs minutes I mean…everyone needs minutes. You can’t just bring people on because you feel sorry for them lol I don’t get that as a reason. A manager has to make a substitution for tactical reasons otherwise what are we just gonna have players coming on every game because the manager feels bad they’re not playing?
1250,Bournemouth,"We haven't seen LOADS of Huijsen, but what we have seen his passing is levels above Senesi. The change usually happens when we're chasing the game, and having someone of his passing ability at the back just opens up the pitch a lot more and he can bring the ball out of defence to create overloads on his side.

Doesn't look like he's physicially ready to start and play 90 minutes, but he's a good option to have to try and give us a different way of breaking teams down. So no, he's not an attacker, but he changes our attacking options. Fair enough, cant see I’ve seen anything of Huijsen to judge. But that’s interesting to hear because as far as I was aware, Senesi is (or was) considered that ball playing CB with great passing range and all"
1251,Bournemouth,I just didn't think Senesi was at his best yesterday. That and the booking made me think it was an obvious change. 
1252,Bournemouth,I think this is the answer that makes most sense. Cant believe people are trying to say he’s come on because he needs minutes and Iraola feels bad. That’s not how football works??!!! You’re assuming that for the most part…I read one person say that & you ran with it bc you’re being close-minded. Why post on here if you don’t want to open your mind & hear alternate perspectives? Don’t make assumptions.
1253,Bournemouth,"I mean…everyone needs minutes. You can’t just bring people on because you feel sorry for them lol I don’t get that as a reason. A manager has to make a substitution for tactical reasons otherwise what are we just gonna have players coming on every game because the manager feels bad they’re not playing? I never said anything about feeling sorry for him. I think he’s good & deserves to play. So, I don’t get why you’re talking about that. It is tactical imo. Keep Senesi card free bc he picks up yellows all the time late in matches & then has been out for suspension in past. Not to mention, he’s been injury prone & this helps keep him fit. And Huijsen is good & we want to develop him as he will likely be a starter for us sooner than later bc someone is coming to scoop Zabarnyi and/or Senesi this summer. If it was about feeling bad, then everyone would be playing? Obviously, this ain’t youth football…this is 💯 tactical & helping progress the club forward in the present & future from my perspective"
1254,Bournemouth,"Fair enough, cant see I’ve seen anything of Huijsen to judge. But that’s interesting to hear because as far as I was aware, Senesi is (or was) considered that ball playing CB with great passing range and all You obviously don’t know anything about Huijsen then & seems like you’re just here to stir 💩 up without thinking or considering any perspectives other than you’re own, which is funny coming from someone posting a question on Reddit. Especially a smaller club page like this Huijsen is an offensive CB as they come. Do your research and/or be open-minded when you clearly don’t know & are asking"

If he’s barely played how do you know how good he is 😂😂"
1258,Bournemouth,Huijsen is an offensive CB as they come. Do your research and/or be open-minded when you clearly don’t know & are asking This is me doing my research hahahaha wtf
1259,Bournemouth,"Everyones literally saying Huijsen has barely played but at the same time you’re trying to tell me he’s the most offensive CB. So which one is it? If he’s barely played how do you know how good he is 😂😂 Yeah he has barely played. And being an offensive CB doesn’t make you the best player? You are using zero logic to defend your fragile ego…again idk why you even asked the question here if you don’t wanna know the answer. And, I’ve watched him play & have done the research. The potential is there, but he’s young & needs to develop. Especially considering he could be a starting option next year…he was almost gonna be the starter this year. We are prepping for Zabarnyi/Senesi exits….what is so hard to understand? Attackers are not the only subs ever made. And when you have a young, talented CB who has great offensive skills why not throw him in to develop when you know Senesi is not gonna come back to help you win & is prolly going to Série A next year…it’s really basic logic…you’re welcome"
1260,Bournemouth,This is me doing my research hahahaha wtf Then be open-minded like I said…all you’ve done is make assumptions that align to your lack of knowledge
1261,Bournemouth,"Yeah he has barely played. And being an offensive CB doesn’t make you the best player?

1263,Bournemouth,"we were so close to a draw... If we could only have played the first 90 minutes like we played the last 7.....

Kudos to Brooks, he came on fighting for his place in the team and made his mark."
1264,Bournemouth,"Semenyo was a little quiet, imagine if he got that last goal. What a friggin volley. "
1265,Bournemouth,"Not a coincidence that Christie was missing from the team and we lost. He's absolutely vital in the midfield block. He may not score, but he creates, defends, and will not give up. He's the spine of the team now that Dom's gone. Him and Cook together are probably the best defensive midfield in the league. "
1266,Bournemouth,I'm still mad.. I mean we went from defeating Man City to this... There are no words Brighton are better than Man City at the moment and they don't suit our play style as much.
1267,Bournemouth,"brighton fan here, will say yall played decently for the first half, however your form dipped tremendously after the baleba red which is pretty weird

also imma be real the ref was fucking shit against us but this is the prem so whatever

i still think yall are a good side tho, had us clenching asses for a while, good luck on the next few games Not the first time Brighton fans have clenched their asses"
1268,Bournemouth,"If we could only have played the first 90 minutes like we played the last 7.....

Kudos to Brooks, he came on fighting for his place in the team and made his mark. Ikr, it's like we realised in the final few minutes we were down 2 goals and were gonna lose if we didn't start attacking"
1269,Bournemouth,Brighton are better than Man City at the moment and they don't suit our play style as much. 
1270,Bournemouth,Not the first time Brighton fans have clenched their asses 
1271,Bournemouth,"Ikr, it's like we realised in the final few minutes we were down 2 goals and were gonna lose if we didn't start attacking "
1272,Bournemouth,why is kepa starting AGAIN 😭

1276,Bournemouth,Found out the hard way today brollys are banned 
1277,Bournemouth,"Got it, much thanks :) "
1278,Bournemouth,"Yeah I realised, most warnings are  on umbrellas. "
1279,Bournemouth,"Tyler Adams, who came on in the second half, not long before we dropped a goal, and has played about 3 times for us in between sicknotes? "
1280,Bournemouth,"He's absolutely fucking superb. Solid as a rock, and only getting better with experience. We'll be lucky to keep him much longer, the boy's going to the top. Signed a new contract in the summer though so it'll be big money if he goes any time soon"
1281,Bournemouth,One of the best CBs in the premiership 🍒🍒👍 
1282,Bournemouth,"He's absolutely superb. Lacking a bit of pace but positioning, physicality, ability on the ball are all top drawer. Very experienced internationally and still so young. He'll play for a huge club in the next couple of years, but the transfer fee will be massive. "
1283,Bournemouth,Dogs bollocks. Whatever you pay will not be in as much as he is worth. You’re lucky you’ve got Hughes. 
1284,Bournemouth,"Very good, only criticism is that he's a little slow on the turn. Very likely will do bigger than better than us in his career. "
1285,Bournemouth,Stay away from our players! 
1286,Bournemouth,"He's our best player. He was our best player last year. He's as solid as a rock, if he could head the ball he'd be playing for Real Madrid. "
1287,Bournemouth,"Better than Ake I reckon and I previously regarded him as our best ever player. 

Boy will be in the champions league in no time. "
1288,Bournemouth,You are not getting him. 
1289,Bournemouth,One of the most underrated defenders in the prem 
1290,Bournemouth,Signed a new contract in the summer though so it'll be big money if he goes any time soon 
1291,Bournemouth,Carlisle pa here. Went to a match with my son. Met the team and Eddie Howe. Love the cherries. Mechanicsburg Here
1292,Bournemouth,"Hudson Valley, NY here with a supporters bar. You’re always welcome to come for a visit! What bar? I visit there occasionaly."
1293,Bournemouth,"Allentown, Pa "
1294,Bournemouth,I’m in Philly! UTCIAD! Ditto
1295,Bournemouth,"Sunbury, PA

Chose the cherries as my team when I lived with roommates who were EPL fans. It was their first year in the league so I picked them. Once I read to about their rise to the league and their history, I was hooked. "
1296,Bournemouth,"Brother, I'm from Idaho "
1297,Bournemouth,"Columbus, Ohio. "
1298,Bournemouth,"Williamsport, Pa "
1299,Bournemouth,Mechanicsburg Here 
1300,Bournemouth,What bar? I visit there occasionaly. Newburgh Brewing Company in Newburgh. Sits a couple blocks up from the Hudson River with immaculate views and we’ve made 2 official beers for the club to boot!
1301,Bournemouth,Ditto 
1302,Bournemouth,Newburgh Brewing Company in Newburgh. Sits a couple blocks up from the Hudson River with immaculate views and we’ve made 2 official beers for the club to boot! 
1303,Bournemouth,"My hot take is that we play much better against top tier teams than teams on our level or below. Hence we lost to Leicester, followed by beating Arsenal, drawing with Villa, trouncing Citeh, then losing to Brentford. Hopefully Brighton will bring the best out of us after the break.... "
1304,Bournemouth,"I don't understand the decision to drop Travers when he was making a lot of amazing saves. 
Unal not looking good either. "
1305,Bournemouth,"I'll sacrifice the point if it finally proves Kepa is a liability and he shouldn't be playing.

I don't understand why we loaned out a decent goalkeeper who was prone to make mistakes, to replace him with a goalkeeper who wasn't playing regularly, and even when he did he was known to make mistakes?! "
1306,Bournemouth,Wonder why Travers didn't start 
1307,Bournemouth,Done with Unal. Travers has the job. Come on 
1308,Bournemouth,"I'm still kinda new to watching soccer, but it looked like our goalie was not good at all today. Flat footed and watching balls go by.. "
1309,Bournemouth,What a cracking game of football.dont mind losing but that thomas Frank is a pure sleeve bag. What does pure sleeve bag mean? Why is he a sleeve bag
1310,Bournemouth,"Just me, or not a lot of subs this game? "
1311,Bournemouth,Is Unal really impressing more in training than PB? I’d much rather see him come on there. We all know he brings more than what Enes has been bringing…no disrespect Miss Philip Bangers
1312,Bournemouth,Unal is not impressive. 
1313,Bournemouth,What does pure sleeve bag mean? 
1314,Bournemouth,Why is he a sleeve bag Their team played the ref as much as they played us. We were dominant first 15 mins. Once they started getting some possession in the first half they were going down under the slightest of contact winning set pieces to slow the game down. When they took the lead they were very slow at restarts and subs. When they had possession they continued to fall down very easily. None of this is against the rules of course but very frustrating and indicative of a sleeve bag.
1315,Bournemouth,Miss Philip Bangers

1317,Bournemouth,"Maybe just play better? 🤷‍♂️ Absolutely true but my point is that his teams are very frustrating to play against. Nothing against the rules, its all fair game but bloody annoying."
1318,Bournemouth,"Absolutely true but my point is that his teams are very frustrating to play against. Nothing against the rules, its all fair game but bloody annoying. "
1319,Bournemouth,"My son lives in Cumberland & has come to enjoy AFC, or at least he keeps up b/c he knows I follow the Cherries. He was a MU fan when he was little, I bought him a little MU kit in Thailand on a liberty visit in the 90s. 

He even bought me t-shirts, & a sweatshirt, at extra cost, he had to buy those from the AFC online shop & pay shipping from, presumably, the South Coast over to me in Central Florida. Love to hear this!"
1320,Bournemouth,no. Sadness
1321,Bournemouth,Love to hear this! 
1322,Bournemouth,Sadness 
1323,Bournemouth,Kepa is useless man. 
1324,Bournemouth,Is there any way to terminate Kepa’s loan 
1325,Bournemouth,I just have a hard time understanding why Kepa comes back into the starting lineup after Travers has played out of his mind recently… Is there a threshold in his contract that he has to play a certain amount of games? I’m not to familiar with contracts as oppose to American sports. 
1326,Bournemouth,I remember people downvoting me for saying no to bringing Kepa to the club....... now look at everyone. I believed you even though I didn’t want to…🥲
1327,Bournemouth,kepa is ass 
1328,Bournemouth,"Good game guys I come in peace I went onto Twitter to see the Bournemouth account and it’s just like Brentford’s, when they lose it’s full of big club fans like Arsenal all over social media being obsessed. yet if we try giving them stick they act better than us haha "
1329,Bournemouth,I believed you even though I didn’t want to…🥲 
1330,Bournemouth,"What difference does it make what country the persons parents happened to be in when they were born?

1345,Bournemouth,"I really want to see him do well.  He seems like a pretty good guy, and he works so hard on the pitch. "
1346,Bournemouth,🤣🫶🏼 
1347,Bournemouth,I feel this way about a lot of our players except Fraser. I actively dislike the little c***. 
1348,Bournemouth,I too always look to see how he's done. He served us well. True professional. Ryan who? Not so much. 
1349,Bournemouth,"Our biggest January transfer target needs to be a decent back up option to Evanilson because Unal is not that Why, what’s wrong with Unal? Sorry, I haven’t been watching the games much recently due to work and uni. I thought he was a somewhat decent backup to solanke last season"
1350,Bournemouth,"Why, what’s wrong with Unal? Sorry, I haven’t been watching the games much recently due to work and uni. I thought he was a somewhat decent backup to solanke last season No pace, no ability to hold the ball up. No idea what to do with the ball when he has it. When he came on against city he lost the ball each time he got it. He’s a good third option but not the guy if Evanilson is out for a chunk of games"
1351,Bournemouth,"No pace, no ability to hold the ball up. No idea what to do with the ball when he has it. When he came on against city he lost the ball each time he got it. He’s a good third option but not the guy if Evanilson is out for a chunk of games This. I feel like the only thing he can do is shoot if it’s teed up for him"
1352,Bournemouth,This. I feel like the only thing he can do is shoot if it’s teed up for him 
1353,Bournemouth,I can. UTC 
1354,Bournemouth,"i don’t think my ass has ever been more clenched SAME. WOW. Put some oil on it, I’m on my way Lmao 100%, I was almost certain a few times it was just a matter of time before CIty managed once again to make a comeback and win against us but for once, NO, THIS TIME WE F\*CKING WIN! HAVE SOME OF THAT!"
1355,Bournemouth,"7 points out of Arsenal, Villa, and City hahahaha fucking inject it Absolutely wild. 

I put a bet on them finishing top 10 but could they hit 7th??? You were great against us (Villa) and deserved the point. 

Fantastic result today. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

Iraolo is clearly a top coach."
1356,Bournemouth,UP THE CHERRIES!! 
1357,Bournemouth,WHAT A FUCKING WIN. UTC!!! 
1358,Bournemouth,Kerkez has been incredible lately 
1359,Bournemouth,My finger nails are GONE. Up the fucking Cherries! 
1360,Bournemouth,"Well done, you lot are on smoke 💀 (arsenal fan). You actually play football against top teams instead of giving up "
1361,Bournemouth,ünal with two absolutely dumb plays that almost gave it up at the end. He’s absolutely dogshit unfortunately. Should have just kept Evanilson on He didn’t seem very fast either. I think this is the first time I’ve seen him play and wonder why we even signed him.
1362,Bournemouth,"Congrats Bournemouth, from a City fan. We've been giving you hell for years and you probably used to consider any game against us an automatic loss. You were way better than us today, well deserved win. Nothing but respect, proper club with great fans, good luck in the rest of your season! Inject more money into your team, lol."
1363,Bournemouth,"I thought that Haaland attempt was in, god bless the post. Up the Cherries! "
1364,Bournemouth,"No way have we come away undefeated with 7 points against Arsenal, Villa and City, incredible stuff!! "
1365,Bournemouth,Wow wow wow wow  I cannot believe 🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒 
1366,Bournemouth,FUCK YES!! UP THE CHERRIES!!!!!! 
1367,Bournemouth,"My stateside family recently adopted the Cherries, perhaps you heard our cheers from across the pond! 

UTFC!!! "
1368,Bournemouth,"I'm really happy we finally beat this cheating bastards.
We played excellent but the last 10 minutes I almost die. A victory is a victory though! UTC and here's to more Evanilson goals!!! "
1369,Bournemouth,"As an Arsenal fan, thank you for making this weekend of football slightly less miserable "
1370,Bournemouth,https://i.imgur.com/j6asHp7.jpeg 
1371,Bournemouth,"What an afternoon out. We've beaten them all now, nobody left to conquer since we made it to the Prem.

Was really, really deserved and when you factor in opposition, our best performance under Iraola "
1372,Bournemouth,Chelsea fan dropping by. That was really solid. Always tough facing you guys away

1376,Bournemouth,"Amazing.  You go back years and think of where we were, and now the 7 points against the last 3 opponents….  Amazing. "

1383,Bournemouth,Up the freaking Cherries! 
1384,Bournemouth,"Glorious that. Looking forward to the reverse fixture being their final home game for some time in the PL, if there is any justice.  But really good work today! "
1385,Bournemouth,Longest 6 minutes to ever have existed.

Iraolo is clearly a top coach. "
1401,Bournemouth,He’s absolutely dogshit unfortunately. Should have just kept Evanilson on Looks like a deer in headlights every time he has the ball. Not meant for this level at all.
1402,Bournemouth,"He didn’t seem very fast either. I think this is the first time I’ve seen him play and wonder why we even signed him. he was walking towards the ball on an open 1v1 that could have sealed the game

instead gave up a counter attack"
1403,Bournemouth,"Inject more money into your team, lol. ![gif](giphy|ch1Z4rUWBZBnO)"
1404,Bournemouth,How? 
1405,Bournemouth,my stomach hurts. 
1406,Bournemouth,Good lord. 
1407,Bournemouth,Looks like a deer in headlights every time he has the ball. Not meant for this level at all. 
1408,Bournemouth,"he was walking towards the ball on an open 1v1 that could have sealed the game

instead gave up a counter attack "
1409,Bournemouth,![gif](giphy|ch1Z4rUWBZBnO) 
1410,Bournemouth,"Said it earlier but this was the most complete game he’s ever played, and to do it across from Silva + Foden is even more impressive. Got forward and obviously made a huge difference there, but his technique defensively has improved so markedly this year and he showed it all off today "
1411,Bournemouth,Wow didn’t realised he’s only 20 
1412,Bournemouth,I keep forgetting he's only 20. He's consistently been good for us and gives it 100% down the left hand side every game. Yesterday was the best I've seen him play for us and he's certainly got a very bright career ahead of him 
1413,Bournemouth,"The 4-3 result against Liverpool I think still tops it for me.  Was that the first major scalp we took in the premier league? The game was sensational, the comeback was unreal and it displayed the quality of a very young Nathan Ake.  I live about 300 meters from the stadium; this afternoon and during the Arsenal game, the noise (with proper live updates!) coming from Dean Court was crazy.  Eddie Howe and Iraola have taken us Cherries to places we never even dreamt of when I was a kid (or even 30!). We used to get free tickets through our school for week night matches just so they could fill some extra seats.  Long live our success and remember where we came from. The premier league was the ice cream, but these wins are the cherries on top. iirc that was the first Cherries game I watched when I could finally watch Prem games here in the states.  I was looking for a team to get behind and I haven't looked back since..  I sit in a mall today waiting for my wife to try on clothes proudly sporting my Cherries Jersey!!! We'd beaten Chelsea 1-0 before but I think it was the first major scalp yes. 

I think in terms of quality of opposition I think some of the Chelsea wins in the last Prem spell were good. The evening game at DC where we smashed this line up 4-0 was absolutely unreal. 

https://preview.redd.it/zie8l222yjyd1.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=de0dcfa2d0e47db72aadf0854461f68b072bdd3d I was on a boring work zoom call DMing a guy about the game and the ROAR from my window for Evinelson’s goal was epic. Just sat in the garden at the 90th minute listening to the chants. Great game!"
1414,Bournemouth,Nothing beats doing united 3 0 at old Trafford 
1415,Bournemouth,"I always felt we could beat city under Iraola, glad they've finally done it. last year we were so unlucky to not get a point against them at home"
1416,Bournemouth,"Greatest win was 2-1 vs Grimsby in 2009. 80 minute Steve Fletcher goal secured our survival in league football. Without it, wins like today would never have happened Facts!"
1417,Bournemouth,"As much as I despise Arsenal I wanted to say the game a couple of weeks ago but I think it has to be the 3-0 at Old Trafford is the greatest win, although its not the same UTD of the past its still Old Traffird and it should have been 4-0, so that game takes my vote

Edit: Another reason is I think Man City i feel has been weakened recently? Doesnt take away from the result of course "
1418,Bournemouth,"Easily top 5 for me, probably top 3 because it's Man City and it's Pep. So glad we FINALLY got a win over him and City. "
1419,Bournemouth,I think the 3-0 at Man United's was better. We totally dominated them even though this modern United is a shadow of what it used to be 
1420,Bournemouth,"Adoni made it sound like they were going to park the bus during his press interview, and boy did they not. What a fun match to watch, and well deserved points! "
1421,Bournemouth,"Its definitely up there, in terms of the quality of our opponent it probably is the best win we've ever had "
1422,Bournemouth,It’s all up there 
1423,Bournemouth,"Quality of opponent beaten makes it the biggest win IMO. I’m not well educated on Bournemouth’s past, but I do know they haven’t been in the Premier League for a large amount of their history, so in terms of Premier League wins, this HAS to be their biggest ever. In terms of all time, I’ll let those that know Bournemouth’s history a bit better tell me if it is the biggest one!

If you were to rank wins that secured league promotions over this one in terms of impact for this ball club, I wouldn’t blame you one bit, but this has to be their biggest league win of all time, period! "
1424,Bournemouth,"Def not the greatest, but I agree that it's up there. I think beating Man Utd 2-0 in the FA Cup in 1984 while Man Utd were in their prime is hard to beat.  I'm old enough to have been at that game and it was an amazing experience. I recall that made national TV news and newspaper headlines all over Europe.... i.e. no internet back then :-). "
1425,Bournemouth,No. Our history is more than just a few years in the Prem. That's why the question was raised 'Greatest' is different to 'most important' so I believe the question is fair
1426,Bournemouth,iirc that was the first Cherries game I watched when I could finally watch Prem games here in the states.  I was looking for a team to get behind and I haven't looked back since..  I sit in a mall today waiting for my wife to try on clothes proudly sporting my Cherries Jersey!!!

1429,Bournemouth,last year we were so unlucky to not get a point against them at home 
1430,Bournemouth,Facts! 
1431,Bournemouth,That's why the question was raised 
1432,Bournemouth,"'Greatest' is different to 'most important' so I believe the question is fair I didn't say it wasn't fair, I gave my answer which is we have had greater wins"
1433,Bournemouth,"I didn't say it wasn't fair, I gave my answer which is we have had greater wins "
1434,Bournemouth,"City are missing like 6 key players. For the first time ever i’m quietly confident we can get a result against them…

^(please don’t reply to this after they bollock us 4-0)

edit: nvm just seen their lineup 💀 It's a free hit. Normally would expect to get nothing from this but with 4 points from the last two tough games, we have good momentum and with their missing players I reckon that we're going to get the win today."
1435,Bournemouth,What a win! 
1436,Bournemouth,"Unal was dreadful with every touch. Im glad someone said it. That last run they had that was open, 1v1. Yea walker’s fast but ünal was walking to the ball

and then almost gave it up at the end with terrible touches. who is this guy?"
1437,Bournemouth,What a WIN 
1438,Bournemouth,"It's a free hit. Normally would expect to get nothing from this but with 4 points from the last two tough games, we have good momentum and with their missing players I reckon that we're going to get the win today. "

1440,Bournemouth,didn’t seem like there was any urgency in his movement at all. 
1441,Brentford,"WTF? No clue, doubt the club wasn't clear about what his role would be when he signed."
1442,Brentford,"Attitude problems could explain why he's not getting any minutes. Hope to be proven wrong and that my speculation is wildly innacurate, but it'd be dissappointing from our recruitment department to splash that much cash on him if he turns out to be a toxic figure with a toxic family. Lurking Liverpool fan here. There was a lot of talk about his bad attitude at LFC. There was a time before the loans he wasn’t getting involved in match day squads despite being fully fit. 

Again, could be BS but this isn’t a good look"
1443,Brentford,"Can't judge the boy by his Dad's ramblings.

Facts are what they are though and so far Fabio has failed to impress on his Premier League minutes.

Hopefully that will improve in time "
1444,Brentford,I would also like to know WTF. 
1445,Brentford,Oh no!…anyway 😑 
1446,Brentford,I’ve seen that he has family and friends around him who have been known to be like this unfortunately 
1447,Brentford,"This happened two days ago. It was brought up at the meeting yesterday. Doesn't seem to be a big deal, Thomas thinks Fabio's doing fine. What meeting?"
1448,Brentford,"I mean, he had his best spell at Hull City so maybe he is more of a Championship caliber player We don’t pay £27.5m for championship caliber players."
1449,Brentford,"We should start him along with mee and Igor against leicester since that's a game we'll probably win regardless. We haven’t beaten Leicester in years, I wouldn’t be so confident We’ve never beaten Leicester in my lifetime."
1450,Brentford,"No clue, doubt the club wasn't clear about what his role would be when he signed. He’s set his account to private now so I can’t ask him. No his family and friends have been known to be toxic in the past. he has people around him who do this a lot"
1451,Brentford,"Lurking Liverpool fan here. There was a lot of talk about his bad attitude at LFC. There was a time before the loans he wasn’t getting involved in match day squads despite being fully fit. 

Again, could be BS but this isn’t a good look Lurking Fulham fan - he played well for us but thought he was above us. He thought wrong"
1452,Brentford,"What meeting? There was a fan forum held by the club. There's video of the whole thing up on YouTube if you look through the Grapevine, but I was just forwarded a voice note from someone who asked the question."
1453,Brentford,We don’t pay £27.5m for championship caliber players. 
1454,Brentford,"We haven’t beaten Leicester in years, I wouldn’t be so confident 1953. 
It’s the one game I’d really like to win. 
We’ve come close, 2 draws 23/24. Leicester was in the championship last season, they just sacked their manager, their Defense is one of the worst in the league, and it'll obviously be a home game, I'm extremely confident."
1455,Brentford,We’ve never beaten Leicester in my lifetime. 
1456,Brentford,He’s set his account to private now so I can’t ask him. 
1457,Brentford,No his family and friends have been known to be toxic in the past. he has people around him who do this a lot Any actual proof of this
1458,Brentford,Lurking Fulham fan - he played well for us but thought he was above us. He thought wrong To be honest he was right to think he was above Fulham. 😉
1459,Brentford,"There was a fan forum held by the club. There's video of the whole thing up on YouTube if you look through the Grapevine, but I was just forwarded a voice note from someone who asked the question. Nice thanks"
1460,Brentford,"1953. 
It’s the one game I’d really like to win. 
We’ve come close, 2 draws 23/24. Okay I didn’t think it was that long haha!!!

They’re one of the few teams (maybe only?) that we haven’t beaten yet"
1461,Brentford,"Leicester was in the championship last season, they just sacked their manager, their Defense is one of the worst in the league, and it'll obviously be a home game, I'm extremely confident. There’s precious few Brentford fans who’ve seen us beat Leicester.    
They’re well over 70."
1462,Brentford,Any actual proof of this Not me personally but I’ve heard like Liverpool and Fulham fans act like this is not a surprise and that they saw similar stuff so he obviously has a bad circle around him
1463,Brentford,To be honest he was right to think he was above Fulham. 😉 
1464,Brentford,Nice thanks 
1465,Brentford,"Okay I didn’t think it was that long haha!!!

They’re one of the few teams (maybe only?) that we haven’t beaten yet "
1466,Brentford,"There’s precious few Brentford fans who’ve seen us beat Leicester.    
They’re well over 70. "
1467,Brentford,Not me personally but I’ve heard like Liverpool and Fulham fans act like this is not a surprise and that they saw similar stuff so he obviously has a bad circle around him 
1468,Brentford,"I guess we’ll take the point. A win would of been great and had the red not happened I'm confident we would of won but with 10 men for 50 minutes, I'm happy with that result Bloody pleased to."
1469,Brentford,A point?? Away from home??? Lets goooo Clean sheet aswell
1470,Brentford,Good defensive display again. Nice to have a point away. Let’s move on. 
1471,Brentford,"If not for that red card, we probably could and would have won that Yeah Everton were toothless."
1472,Brentford,"A point playing 10v12 is decent, I'll take it. Collins motm "
1473,Brentford,"Could’ve been worse. No injuries, right? Unless we can talk it down  Norsgaards red was for serious foul play according to guardian, so no injuries but we lack el capitan for 3 games."
1474,Brentford,"Not our proudest performance, but brilliant defensive work. And again, flekken keeping us in it "
1475,Brentford,"Everton fan here. We were absolutely woeful, but fair play, your defending was resolute. DCL is no better than Maupay from what I’ve seen."
1476,Brentford,"Love to see dividends from the KLP investment. He’s developing well. He's a duracell bunny, but yeah he's got some serious talent too! If he can improve at one on ones he'll be world class."
1477,Brentford,Amazing point and clean sheet against Everton and the premier league. (who knew they could work together) lost a chance of 3 points but a very solid point nonetheless 
1478,Brentford,![gif](giphy|3oKIP6cQ7KAkr8scPS|downsized) 
1479,Brentford,Considering I’ve been screaming at the TV about our defense for the past month and they held…there are good draws and bad draws and this is a good one 
1480,Brentford,Clean sheet ! And our first away point ! Such a shame Norgaard got sent off as Everton were poor I thought. Onwards and upwards and great to see Thiago out there 
1481,Brentford,"Big performance from Collins, LP and Flekken. "
1482,Brentford,Thiago 👀 
1483,Brentford,That draw was a win 
1484,Brentford,"It felt like a game where we might concede in extra time like so many times before but we held strong. Terrible refereeing hurt us but also not sharp enough when we did get opportunities in the final third. On a positive note, Thiago looks solid, and the improvement this year of Flekken, Collins, KLP and Damsgaard is refreshing "
1485,Brentford,We need to appeal that red card. What a load of bull. 
1486,Brentford,"How did Thiago play? For the 20 he was on. Looked ready. Will add to the attack. 
Risks upsetting the Wissa/Mbeumo connection tho’"
1487,Brentford,"How did Thiago look? Big, dangerous, ready to go."
1488,Brentford,A clean sheet & a point away from home! Didn’t think I’d live to see the day 😆 
1489,Brentford,I’ll gladly take a point here. And awesome to see Thiago fit 
1490,Brentford,On to the next! Up them Bee’s Baby! 
1491,Brentford,Could Thiago take Wissa's spot against Leicester ? Tough one. He could but it would rightly anger Wissa but he needs to start soon. Wissa will likely move to LW
1492,Brentford,"Looked like Norgaard knicked the ball so red seemed harsh, but given that got to be happy taking a point on the road. Nearly matched them in xg despite them having the ball more and an extra guy. "
1493,Brentford,"A win would of been great and had the red not happened I'm confident we would of won but with 10 men for 50 minutes, I'm happy with that result Exactly this, first cleansheet of the season too. Not a bad day all things considered."
1494,Brentford,Bloody pleased to. 
1495,Brentford,Clean sheet aswell 
1496,Brentford,Yeah Everton were toothless. In the first half from what i heard they were all right but we dominated the  second
1497,Brentford,"Unless we can talk it down  Norsgaards red was for serious foul play according to guardian, so no injuries but we lack el capitan for 3 games. "
1498,Brentford,DCL is no better than Maupay from what I’ve seen. At least Maupay was fun to watch.
1499,Brentford,"He's a duracell bunny, but yeah he's got some serious talent too! If he can improve at one on ones he'll be world class. "
1500,Brentford,"Looked ready. Will add to the attack. 
Risks upsetting the Wissa/Mbeumo connection tho’ "
1501,Brentford,"Big, dangerous, ready to go. The man is a giant!"
1502,Brentford,Tough one. He could but it would rightly anger Wissa but he needs to start soon. 
1503,Brentford,Wissa will likely move to LW  Damsgaard is doing pretty well tho ?
1504,Brentford,"Exactly this, first cleansheet of the season too. Not a bad day all things considered. "
1505,Brentford,"In the first half from what i heard they were all right but we dominated the  second Yeah the got away some long range shots but we looked more dangerous. 
They spent time in our half but we looked like where the goals were going to come from."
1506,Brentford,At least Maupay was fun to watch. On his day he can be incredible. Problem is he has his day once every three-four months.
1507,Brentford,The man is a giant! 
1508,Brentford," Damsgaard is doing pretty well tho ? Damsgaard is also better in the midfield than as a winger, so that's fine. With Nørgaard out for potentially 3 games there's room for him."
1509,Brentford,"Yeah the got away some long range shots but we looked more dangerous. 
They spent time in our half but we looked like where the goals were going to come from. "
1510,Brentford,On his day he can be incredible. Problem is he has his day once every three-four months. 
1511,Brentford,"Damsgaard is also better in the midfield than as a winger, so that's fine. With Nørgaard out for potentially 3 games there's room for him. Fair !"
1512,Brentford,Fair ! 
1513,Brentford,Still shots really don’t tell the story of what happened Are you suggesting studs into the thigh does not deserve a red card?
1514,Brentford,"Also not a tackle No, not a tackle. He went studs up into his knee. Sad it happened to him, but that's the rules"
1515,Brentford,Not a tackle but cool. 
1516,Brentford,Tbh I can see why that’s a red. Real shame as Everton were there for the taking Yeah unfortunate and unintentional but can’t argue too much with the red I agree that it’s a red but it is unfortunate that he was just trying to win the ball I don’t think he should be banned for three games because of that. It also looked like wissa should’ve scored when he went 1v1 with Pickford but oh well I’ll take a clean sheet and any points away
1517,Brentford,“Red card attempt to score” 
1518,Brentford,"That looks way worse in the picture than it did at speed during the game. Not a fan of the call, but if the ref saw something like this shot.... "
1519,Brentford,It’s crazy how I still can’t find a video of it anywhere haha 
1520,Brentford,"Never a red . Not Malicous, deliberate or dangerous . The ball was there to be won . "
1521,Brentford,He was bloody trying to reach the ball to score. It was not a red in any way 
1522,Brentford,It looked like he nicked the ball and caught him on the flow through. No denying he caught Pickford but there was no intent in that 
1523,Brentford,The still makes it look worse than the intent of going for the ball 
1524,Brentford,It’s absolutely mad that this was a red. 
1525,Brentford,"A great example of the issue with VAR.

Supposed to only intervene for a clear and obvious error.

Sliding in at the far post attempting to stab the ball in the net is not a tackle, nor is it a foul.

By watching it back repeatedly in slow motion and using a still image, it completely distorts the actual situation.

We'll appeal it and it SHOULD be overturned. "
1526,Brentford,Are you suggesting studs into the thigh does not deserve a red card? I’m suggesting that the still shot doesn’t actually tell the story of how and why this happened
1527,Brentford,"No, not a tackle. He went studs up into his knee. Sad it happened to him, but that's the rules "
1528,Brentford,Yeah unfortunate and unintentional but can’t argue too much with the red 
1529,Brentford,I agree that it’s a red but it is unfortunate that he was just trying to win the ball I don’t think he should be banned for three games because of that. It also looked like wissa should’ve scored when he went 1v1 with Pickford but oh well I’ll take a clean sheet and any points away 
1530,Brentford,I’m suggesting that the still shot doesn’t actually tell the story of how and why this happened True.  Still a red card though.
1531,Brentford,True.  Still a red card though. 
1532,Brentford,"Subs: Valdimarrson, Schade, THIAGO, Cavarlho, Mee, Yarmoluk, Konak, Roerslev, Maghoma "
1533,Brentford,thiago finally on his way back 
1534,Brentford,Hope to see Thiago get some minutes later on in the game. 
1535,Brentford,"Oh okay lets punish players for just trying to score in a bang bang play Even made contact with the ball first, albeit slight"
1536,Brentford,I can't believe that is given. Norgaard was going for the ball and Pickford is moving in front of him 
1537,Brentford,Let's put an end to this away form curse and smash this lot. Go Bees! 
1538,Brentford,That is an ABSURD red. 
1539,Brentford,Horse shit red card 
1540,Brentford,"Please, let Flekken get a clean sheet "
1541,Brentford,"Well it's not an impressive start, our progressive passing leaves a lot to be desired Every game we start out like they have never played with each other before, so many passes where the receiver is like oh shit the ball is coming to me! Daamsgard can’t get a touch"
1542,Brentford,Fucking disgrace. 
1543,Brentford,The refereeing in the prem continues to be horrendous with no accountability for bad performances. PGMOL are more focused on punished players and managers that speak out about it than improving the refereeing 
1544,Brentford,Flekken bailing us out again 
1545,Brentford,"Anytime a striker stretches for a cross just have the GK run into his foot, easy red cards. "
1546,Brentford,This ref is a fucking bitch Amen
1547,Brentford,"KLP has been our best player today I don’t like seeing Daamsgard going off.
I would think Damsgaard to Thiago would be deadly to Everton"
1548,Brentford,"Fucking bullshit, it wasn't a tackle, he's stretching to reach for a goal scoring opportunity Ref agreed until VAR called him over"
1549,Brentford,This is a hard watch early on 
1550,Brentford,"So close for wissa, man "
1551,Brentford,Thankful we have Collins 
1552,Brentford,Wissa? You're supposed to score those :( 
1553,Brentford,That was such a dogshit red card. 
1554,Brentford,Well that was a frustrating first half. But even with 10 men we can win this game. 
1555,Brentford,Thiago's strength on the ball is so refreshing to watch 
1556,Brentford,"Once again somewhat struggling to keep possession, lots of sloppy touches that are going a little too far? "
1557,Brentford,I know Wissa will score. I remember his goal against Chelsea and all the misses that came before. 
1558,Brentford,This ref has it out for us 
1559,Brentford,"Man this ref sucks, feels like every single time there is any contact we get a whistle. let the men play ball "
1560,Brentford,"I can’t believe what is happening, but I’m so sleep deprived I’m not sure if it’s good or bad "
1561,Brentford,I’m shitting myself The curse of conceding after 90mins hangs heavy on my mind.
1562,Brentford,❤️🐝❤️ 
1563,Brentford,Come on you Bees! 🐝 Let’s take 20 points from them 
1564,Brentford,WHAT THE FUCK 
1565,Brentford,"You are not supposed to use the VAR, come on! "
1566,Brentford,I don’t even know guys. Wtf was that card. Really? Wow. Hard to believe VAR called the ref over
1567,Brentford,Branthwaithe gets away with that bullshit but every time we win the ball in a dangerous position the whistle is blown. Cool. 
1568,Brentford,"Not to take anything away from Flekken's immense goalkeeping this game, but his distribution has been unusually poor. "
1569,Brentford,What the fuck was that? 
1570,Brentford,I hate Prickford. Always have. Always will. Pickford was really selling it too. Ironic given his history of nasty tackles
1571,Brentford,Game us bullshit 
1572,Brentford,"That's not a foul on Wissa, come on... "
1573,Brentford,"Dams has had a poor game besides that one great pass to Wissa, might be worth subbing out sooner rather than later "
1574,Brentford,"Oh great Schade might be coming in to do nothing He’s coming on in his preferred position. Thiago will be the striker.

He’ll put crosses into Thiago. He doesn’t have to score"
1575,Brentford,I think they should swap wissa for thiago we need some height if all we can do is launch it since we are down a man. Need a target. 
1576,Brentford,How do we not convert these chances... 
1577,Brentford,KLP needs to be sharper when we have players forward. But I like how we are playing 
1578,Brentford,Nice to have some strength up top for a change. Having a plan B for situations like this is ideal He’s going to be a monster for us.
1579,Brentford,"We take that, 1st CS and away point "
1580,Brentford,"i'll take a point after the red. Did we get a single marginal call go our way today? Not even close to getting one. The added time is prob the only thing, should have been 7 or 8 really not 4"
1581,Brentford,Ugh that might be a red card.. He was clearly going for the ball but that was rough
1582,Brentford,"[deleted] He was having a decent game. Every flat cross you will see players stretching to reach it, he likely never saw Pickford"
1583,Brentford,This is more like it 
1584,Brentford,"Even made contact with the ball first, albeit slight It’s never a penalty. It probably shouldn’t even be a yellow."
1585,Brentford,"Every game we start out like they have never played with each other before, so many passes where the receiver is like oh shit the ball is coming to me! "
1586,Brentford,Daamsgard can’t get a touch 
1587,Brentford,Amen 
1588,Brentford,"I don’t like seeing Daamsgard going off.
I would think Damsgaard to Thiago would be deadly to Everton "
1589,Brentford,Ref agreed until VAR called him over 
1590,Brentford,The curse of conceding after 90mins hangs heavy on my mind. 
1591,Brentford,Hard to believe VAR called the ref over No doubt.
1592,Brentford,Pickford was really selling it too. Ironic given his history of nasty tackles 
1593,Brentford,"He’s coming on in his preferred position. Thiago will be the striker.

He’ll put crosses into Thiago. He doesn’t have to score "
1594,Brentford,He’s going to be a monster for us. 
1595,Brentford,Not even close to getting one. 
1596,Brentford,"The added time is prob the only thing, should have been 7 or 8 really not 4 "
1597,Brentford,He was clearly going for the ball but that was rough 
1598,Brentford,"He was having a decent game. Every flat cross you will see players stretching to reach it, he likely never saw Pickford "
1599,Brentford,It’s never a penalty. It probably shouldn’t even be a yellow. 
1600,Brentford,No doubt. 
1601,Brentford,I made a new username ( very similar too the old one) . Just putting it out there. This is my first season with theBees and as a fan from across the pond I’m not familiar with the breaks and what not. I didn’t like it at first but it is what it is. I’m ready for a win. Let’s Go 👉U Bee’s 🐝 🐝 
1602,Brentford,"Would love to see Thiago make his PL debut today. Come on you bees. That would really be something, to see him come on at 70min."
1603,Brentford,"Dyche has a 100% record against us which is mad. Hopefully we can at least score some goals and and have another entertaining game, as much as we’re up and down it has been terribly exciting. "
1604,Brentford,Good teams beat bad teams when they're down.  Let's do the business today bees. 
1605,Brentford,"That would really be something, to see him come on at 70min. "
1606,Brentford,A bore draw? Were you at the game? It was anything but. 
1607,Brentford,"There will be a box office collection point. You'll probably need photo ID, and confirmation of your purchase (email receipt?).  Because everything is online they can confirm the sale and issue a duplicate ticket. 

I once travelled to Leicester away and had left the tickets at home, but got in OK. Was the ID needed for both tickets or just the main purchaser / collector? Bought a ticket for me and a friend but the second ticket is under my brothers name so hoping they won’t need both Leaving the ticket at home? That must have been a nightmare realisation."
1608,Brentford,"Was the ID needed for both tickets or just the main purchaser / collector? Bought a ticket for me and a friend but the second ticket is under my brothers name so hoping they won’t need both In my case both tickets had been bought together for two named members as well, and as I'd paid and had the id they reissued both tickets. In fact the other ticket wasn't actually being used by the person in whose name it had been bought either, but that complication didn't arise. Just go to the window by yourself. Say your ""brother"" is still in the pub.

Yep left the tickets on the kitchen table and forgot to pick them up on the way out. Didn't realise until I was at the ground. At least I knew there was no risk of anyone else using them in our place."
1609,Brentford,Leaving the ticket at home? That must have been a nightmare realisation. 
1610,Brentford,"In my case both tickets had been bought together for two named members as well, and as I'd paid and had the id they reissued both tickets.

1611,Brentford,"Ponne is a very funny and nice guy. I'm a season ticket holder at Malmö FF and a huge fan so I really love the guy. He’s a great guy, yeah. Haven’t been following Malmo unfortunately, but it seems you’ve done very well and so has Pontus since he’s returned. Best of luck for the future from the U.K."
1612,Brentford,No sign of Bradley Walsh? No. Sadly.
1613,Brentford,"Great stuff. What was the occasion ? Evans is an absolute unit 😂 It was just called the HALL OF FAME 2024. The first one they’ve held for a few years and there were so many players / managers at tables and milling around. My Mum entered a draw and got lucky, so we went together. Paid event, but well worth it. Other stars were Marcus Gayle, Dean Holdsworth, Keith Millen, Terry Hurlock, Kevin O’Connor etc."
1614,Brentford,Ahh yes. Apparently was an excellent night. 
1615,Brentford,"Who was the best dressed?   
Peter Gilham’s jacket looks great. Yeah, everyone made an effort and looked smart. Peter’s jacket was class - he looked very dapper and is aging like a fine wine. Andy Scott was there too and he was immaculately turned out TBH. 👍"
1616,Brentford,"He’s a great guy, yeah. Haven’t been following Malmo unfortunately, but it seems you’ve done very well and so has Pontus since he’s returned. Best of luck for the future from the U.K. He's done really well. He won the award for the league's best defender the same night he accepted his induction to the hall of fame. He's, unfortunately, injured right now and will be out for Ferencvaros and Galatasaray."
1617,Brentford,No. Sadly. 
1618,Brentford,"It was just called the HALL OF FAME 2024. The first one they’ve held for a few years and there were so many players / managers at tables and milling around.

1620,Brentford,"He's done really well. He won the award for the league's best defender the same night he accepted his induction to the hall of fame. He's, unfortunately, injured right now and will be out for Ferencvaros and Galatasaray. "
1621,Brentford,You’re best to ask on here and the Brentford grapevine if anyone wants them 
1622,Brentford,"Yeah Grapevine or Facebook best bet. Club *might* take em back dependent, I've had them do it once maybe. "
1623,Brentford,I voted for the 4:3 v Ipswich. 
1624,Brentford,I will shove this page to my friend's eyes who laughed at me when i told him our games are the best. 
1625,Brentford,We played the most boring anti football at Craven Cottage so no idea why that's on this list Two stoppage time goals from a substitute will always be entertaining
1626,Brentford,Fulham game !? 
1627,Brentford,Two stoppage time goals from a substitute will always be entertaining 
1628,Brentford,"Wicked, we should have got him in the summer really, he put in a proper shift I think he would have been to expensive.  He’s waiting for his contract to run out end of 2025 then he’s of a free and we can give him a £9m deal over 3 years."
1629,Brentford,"Would be a good buy. Not a long term solution, but solid stop gap and good cover. 

I’ll be honest LWP has been fairly decent at WB. A better defender than Canos was and just as good in attack. You don't offer a stop gap a £9m deal."
1630,Brentford,"He was fairly inconsistent throughout his loan (though better towards the end of the season) and he would be second choice when Rico returns, and given his age he wouldn't have much of a re-sale value. Ideally Meghoma will develop into a useful backup to Rico, and KLP has proven to fulfill his defensive duties quite well when filling in at LB. 

I don't hate the idea, but I would rather gamble more on youth. "
1631,Brentford,"Article begins ""John Wenham has speculated"". "
1632,Brentford,"Just play meghoma, hes ready and hes a baller. "
1633,Brentford,Just seen the Norway highlights. Nusa would’ve been good for us I’m going to watch them now.
1634,Brentford,Won’t Rico come in as LB ? I hope so but he could be a bit off after a long period of injury and a good backup is needed to rotate the LW position
1635,Brentford,Nonsense article 
1636,Brentford,"I think he would have been to expensive.  He’s waiting for his contract to run out end of 2025 then he’s of a free and we can give him a £9m deal over 3 years. Yeah his wages were ridiculously high at Tottenham. Sounds pretty sensible, it’s about time we invest in fullback depth haha"
1637,Brentford,You don't offer a stop gap a £9m deal. 
1638,Brentford,I’m going to watch them now. 
1639,Brentford,I hope so but he could be a bit off after a long period of injury and a good backup is needed to rotate the LW position 
1640,Brentford,"Yeah his wages were ridiculously high at Tottenham. Sounds pretty sensible, it’s about time we invest in fullback depth haha Since rampant speculation appears to be on order here 😜    

He does Spurs *zero* good right now. Not playing competitive ball, he does himself *zero* good right now. I think we get him on another cheap loan in January, because:  

* We get *him*
* He gets *us* 
* Spurs gets to say ""we did you a solid, *twice*""

When Yoane or Bryan comes up for transfer and they're in the mix, you better believe they'll bring this up if it comes to the fine margins."
1641,Brentford,"Since rampant speculation appears to be on order here 😜

1642,Brentford,What’s going on here? Looks like we’re practically guiding teams by giving teams space to attack down the left. 
1643,Brentford,Interesting that the closest teams to us are city and arsenal That shows how good we are lol
1644,Brentford,That shows how good we are lol 
1645,Brentford,"I believe the answer is officially no, but you will be absolutely fine. We share tickets throughout my friendship group. We've had no issues men getting in on female names either. They never check Thanks, that was my worry"
1646,Brentford,"Yeah, you'll be fine. All that's done is a QR code for the ticket is scanned by the machine, you don't need corresponding ID with it or anything. "
1647,Brentford,"My girlfriend, her family and I have got six season tickets and two memberships between us. We just share them out to whoever is available. Never had a problem at all. "
1648,Brentford,"The only caveat would be an adult entering on a senior or a child's ticket as they wouldn't be paying the correct price. They might be intercepted by the stewards, but I've never seen it. "
1649,Brentford,"Reality is, they’d rather a Brentford fan in that seat so as long as that’s happening I don’t think they really mind at all. "
1650,Brentford,I had the task of scanning three season tickets last game to avoid yellow cards after abit of blagging after the second one just the steward what I’m doing and he was fine he thought it was bullshit too 
1651,Brentford,Yeah they don't check names 
1652,Brentford,They don't check (my brother uses my membership for his mates all the time) 
1653,Brentford,"Yes your ticket is yours to use so if you can't make it you can give it to someone else.

You technically can't sell it.

An adult using an adult ticket, senior a senior, child a child etc is the only caveat Is that the official stance too ?  Like if for whatever reason the gender being different did get questioned, I can just say that and I'm good to go?"
1654,Brentford,"Just scan the QR code so its not an issue. Only time it can be an issue is when you scan a u25 or child ticket, the scanner goes a different colour to adult ticket. However, do not be that person who brings an AWAY FAN in to the home end. "
1655,Brentford,"Thanks, that was my worry Yeah, you’ll be fine. My aunt has a season ticket which I often use, and they never check.  As a 40+ YO bloke I often wonder what would happen if they did, but I’m sure it would be handled well. Chill guys and girls on the turnstiles."
1656,Brentford,"Is that the official stance too ?  Like if for whatever reason the gender being different did get questioned, I can just say that and I'm good to go? You're best off checking online to be safe but that is my interpretation of it yes.

An adult Season ticket holder can't make it then they can give their ticket to a friend or family member to use as long as they are in the same age category. 

My male cousin has used my wifes before now."
1657,Brentford,"Yeah, you’ll be fine. My aunt has a season ticket which I often use, and they never check.  As a 40+ YO bloke I often wonder what would happen if they did, but I’m sure it would be handled well. Chill guys and girls on the turnstiles. "
1658,Brentford,"You're best off checking online to be safe but that is my interpretation of it yes.

An adult Season ticket holder can't make it then they can give their ticket to a friend or family member to use as long as they are in the same age category. 

My male cousin has used my wifes before now. "
1659,Brentford,"All of our home games have been against the lower performing Other 14 teams and we didn't deserve to win against Crystal Palace. 

Our away games have generally speaking been against Big 6 teams or better performing Other 14 teams.

The Home / Away form thing I wouldn't read much into.

Chelsea are back in form. There are a number of other 14 teams who are performing remarkably better than us.

There is no guarantee of how many European spots there are.

We're 11 games in and doing ok and I am enjoying watching Brentford and I am less afraid of relegation this season compared to last. I'm happy, but ""probably the season when we can get into Europe"" I don't agree there. Ok, I guess that's your opinion"
1660,Brentford,The Fulham came would have helped... 
1661,Brentford,"Nah we’re not ready for Europe. How long did it take Brighton to push for it and look how it really hurt them? We were very close the second season but got ripped apart with injuries last year, we would have been annihilated in Europe.  

We need to find consistent mid table finishes to be able to attract the players and sponsorships/investment that can help us push up. 

We are always put as relegation candidates by everyone and we need to change that narrative and build slowly up to something bigger without over extorting ourselves and getting into trouble. Totally agree.

Even if we were relatively injury free, we don't have the squad to play in additional midweek games for half the season.

If we did make Europe and had a bad run of injuries, that would be a guaranteed relegation battle.

I'd be happy with a few 9th-12th placed finishes, like you said, to build the narrative and hopefully have more strength in depth. Finishing 9th was a stroke of luck that season. Had we finished in a European spot and given our injuries last season I think it would have cost us place in the Premier League."
1662,Brentford,I’m proud of our home form but they are both just hard to keep for instance they talk of our away from but it’s been city Liverpool Utd and Fulham etc but same time our home form has been the bottom five also 
1663,Brentford,"Its not happening boys, next season maybe.
Baby steps. "
1664,Brentford,Unlikely we are going to make Europe 
1665,Brentford,"Now watch Damsgaard, Mbeumo and Flekken pick up international duty injuries! You take that back Why would you speak this into existence, mate???"
1666,Brentford,"Ok, I guess that's your opinion "
1667,Brentford,"Totally agree.

Even if we were relatively injury free, we don't have the squad to play in additional midweek games for half the season.

If we did make Europe and had a bad run of injuries, that would be a guaranteed relegation battle.

I'd be happy with a few 9th-12th placed finishes, like you said, to build the narrative and hopefully have more strength in depth. Exactly.

And most of our stars want to leave us now.

Like Newcastle and Barcelona wanted Mbeumo.

 We were looking at some called ""a Hungarian youngster for replacing MBEUMO"" and even a German Kahn."
1668,Brentford,Finishing 9th was a stroke of luck that season. Had we finished in a European spot and given our injuries last season I think it would have cost us place in the Premier League. 
1669,Brentford,You take that back 🫠
1670,Brentford,"Why would you speak this into existence, mate??? "
1671,Brentford,"Exactly.

And most of our stars want to leave us now.

Like Newcastle and Barcelona wanted Mbeumo.

 We were looking at some called ""a Hungarian youngster for replacing MBEUMO"" and even a German Kahn. Exactly? Wtf you mean exactly. They argue against your point and you agree with them? Lol

And the guy above accurately commenting on our form and who we've played and you say, well that's your opinion..?

Are you an ass or just look like one?"
1672,Brentford,🫠 
1673,Brentford,"Exactly? Wtf you mean exactly. They argue against your point and you agree with them? Lol

And the guy above accurately commenting on our form and who we've played and you say, well that's your opinion..?

Are you an ass or just look like one? "
1674,Brentford,"I keep telling people that they have no idea how much Thiago is going to impact us when he comes back. I know it was a short cameo, but against Wimbledon he was unreal. So fast, so strong, so aware, great vision. Was the most excited I've been about a players performance in pre season since I saw Raya out in Austria"
1675,Brentford,"Completely agree, Igor did look great. It also seems Nunes played well in the friendly. Hopefully we can see them Hickey and Henry at the Gtech soon! "
1676,Brentford,Was the most excited I've been about a players performance in pre season since I saw Raya out in Austria 
1677,Brentford,"Home: Palace, Southampton, West Ham, Wolves, Ipswich, Bournemouth

Away: Liverpool, Spurs, City, United, Fulham

We certainly are not going to keep up our home form, but not our away form either. The entire slate is top 10 teams, except United :).

It has been a weird start to the season with super easy home fixtures and pretty difficult away fixtures. Hard to get a grasp of how good this team is. Definitely not in danger of relegation, unless an injury crisis happens like last year. But outside Southampton, don't think the worst teams in the league are as bad as last year either. "
1678,Brentford,better this than the other way around! 
1679,Brentford,Interesting. 0 away points but looks a lot worse for some of those teams who are meant to be challenging for top four (Spurs!) 
1680,Brentford,"Arsenal fan here. your away form might look poor but playing Liverpool at anfield, city at the etihad and utd at old trafford (no matter how bad their form) it's not all that disappointing. And you've got some of the hardest fixtures out the way. "
1681,Brentford,"
I just entered the ballot for the Arsenal home game a few weeks ago and found out that I was selected for tickets yesterday. I believe the website says they let you know 5 or 6 weeks prior to the game. As far as getting tickets if you dont get lucky with the ballots I believe it depends on if it's a Cat A or B game if it's a Cat B you can get tickets off the ticket transfer if it's a Cat A unless you have points from going to previous games it kind of seems you are SOL. If it's a cat A you might be able to continuously pester the ticket office for help other than that it doesn't seem like there are options aside from getting lucky with ballot or risking it with strangers on here or forums/Facebook. Thanks. That’s how I would’ve guessed it goes. I wish I could make it to a less marquee game, but the only game I can theoretically make with my schedule is the Chelsea game in April. I’ve applied through the ballot - fingers crossed. 🐝"
1682,Brentford,"For the second part of your question, one thing to consider is that it will be harder to find two tickets on the exchange right next to each other rather than two singles nearby. Depending on the age of your daughter, that may or may not be an issue. Yeah, she’s 8, so it would be less than ideal to be too far apart. haha"
1683,Brentford,"Make sure to check the website starting 5-6 weeks before the match. I didn't get an email or anything and almost missed the window

Also make sure to pick up the physical tickets at the box office the PDF ticket doesn't work "
1684,Brentford,"Thanks. That’s how I would’ve guessed it goes. I wish I could make it to a less marquee game, but the only game I can theoretically make with my schedule is the Chelsea game in April. I’ve applied through the ballot - fingers crossed. 🐝 Same situation for me the only time I could take off was during the holidays, but it worked out. They save 100 tickets for overseas and to be honest even for the big games I'd be interested to see how many of that 100 are actually taken by overseas members I know the club is growing but 100 internationals for any given game is i feel like a pretty decent number. Good luck hope the ballot saves you the headache."

1687,Brentford,"""Mikel f\*kcing Damsgaard"" "
1688,Brentford,I will bet my only pair of boxers that he wins the next ballon d’or 
1689,Brentford,"He’s been so good lately, him and Wissa are on the Team of the Week as well: 

https://www.premierleague.com/news/4170608 "
1690,Brentford,"Got his first premier league goal too, performance has been fantastic so glad he finally closed out the goalless narrative. "
1691,Brentford,Legit 
1692,Brentford,"We got him under contract till 26/27.     
I hope we can extend it. "
1693,Brentford,"I haven't seen him play but unless he's available for less than 10m I can't see this being good business personally, thiago and carvalho were signed in the summer. That's enough for now. The bees are hardly shy of a goal or 2 as it is. Keep in mind that we're almost certainly going to lose Mbeumo in the summer, potentially also Wissa, and Schade really isn't there yet. Carvalho is more of a midfielder than forward. Kuhn is a great player, but Celtic aren't going to sell him cheap. Especially now that they're doing decently well in the Champions League. Less than 10m? Celtic wouldn’t sell for any less than 20/25m I’d imagine.
No need to sell unless it’s a ridiculous offer.
They’ve making bucket loads in the Champions League and are sitting on cash reserves of over 100m."
1694,Brentford,"This is old news, was kicking about in summer too. Apparently their agent still fancies a move tho. "
1695,Brentford,"He had a slow start at Celtic, despite a fantastic pre-season game against Man City, but now he's performing really well. Celtic paid around £3m for him to Rapid Vienna in the last winter transfer window, so they could easily sell him for a big profit in the next window. 

A possible replacement for Mbeumo? Possibly. I can't see Fulham needing another winger. "
1696,Brentford,"Keep in mind that we're almost certainly going to lose Mbeumo in the summer, potentially also Wissa, and Schade really isn't there yet. Carvalho is more of a midfielder than forward. "
1697,Brentford,"Kuhn is a great player, but Celtic aren't going to sell him cheap. Especially now that they're doing decently well in the Champions League. "

1699,Brentford,Janelt has been adding to his highlight reel these last two games. Perfectly weighted ball that curled right in front of Wissa Great pass but I think Wissa does well to get across the defender so he can’t make a tackle.
1700,Brentford,Beautiful 
1701,Brentford,One of the most beautiful goals I’ve ever seen 
1702,Brentford,Great pass but I think Wissa does well to get across the defender so he can’t make a tackle. 
1703,Brighton,"Imagine this means Hurzeler just wants to get him a bit more match fitness. Hopefully can start making an impact from the bench soon Yeah the animosity towards him in this thread is so weird to me. He's an exciting young player with a lot of talent who has been plagued by awful injuries but loves football. He clearly wants to play, and the U21s are a great way to get match fitness back. If you're not playing in the starting 11 then you'd want to be in the U21s."
1704,Brighton,Hope Cam has a good game 🇦🇺 He just scored!
1705,Brighton,"Where is Kadioglu , Is he injured ? Last I heard, yes he’s hurt."
1706,Brighton,How is Jamie Mullins playing so far this season? I also want to know this answer. Up the Bohs!
1707,Brighton,The Paraguayan fans on Instagram are NOT going to be happy LOL How come? Did he not travel to play for them? They have an irrational hate for him from what I've seen so I doubt anything he could do would make them happy.
1708,Brighton,"https://www.youtube.com/live/3ig2hJwk-M8?si=ZnN7MMTZCSJiUFEW

Link for those watching the game. Currently in 13’ "
1709,Brighton,He'll be pissed He asked to be part of the U21s a couple of seasons ago to stay involved.  He might see himself as a bit beyond that now though. Why do you think that? I think he'll be happy to play
1710,Brighton,He’s playing… the same as he always is. Taking shots at goal Subbed off at halftime which was planned. Team just scored without him though. I didn’t think he was making good decisions at the level of a first team player. Trying too hard to force the goal. Poor decision-making. Selfish player
1711,Brighton,😬 That feels rude. Solly started during a 10 nil hammering of Palace. Maybe they’re going for a bit of the same? I can’t imagine he starts on Friday then. 
1712,Brighton,"Brutal, he's definitely wound someone up at the club and this is teaching him a lesson. "
1713,Brighton,"Yeah the animosity towards him in this thread is so weird to me. He's an exciting young player with a lot of talent who has been plagued by awful injuries but loves football.

1719,Brighton,Why do you think that? I think he'll be happy to play 
1720,Brighton,Subbed off at halftime which was planned. Team just scored without him though. I didn’t think he was making good decisions at the level of a first team player. Trying too hard to force the goal. Hmm seeing this half and his other performances off the bench I can see why rutter and Pedro get in over him. They work harder and make better decisions. If you can’t even work hard then you don’t deserve to start in this huerzeler team. Even the technical quality is suspect because Rutter is insane.
1721,Brighton,Poor decision-making. Selfish player 
1722,Brighton,"hey if march can play one, idt enciso should put it below him to play onw At least it’s European opposition! That kind of has me worried tho, because Solly played that one game and poof, nothing after that."
1723,Brighton,well he's still U21...

If you can’t even work hard then you don’t deserve to start in this huerzeler team. Even the technical quality is suspect because Rutter is insane. Rutter and Pedro are 2 and 3 years older and have had far fewer injuries compared to him to disrupt their development. Rutter and Pedro have had 2 and 27 games missed due to injury whereas Enciso has been injured for 53 games since 2020. 

He definitely has talent, and if he learns to use it will be a great asset as his long shot is lethal."

1728,Brighton,"Honestly, everyone has been absolutely clinical this season. But if I have to name some, it would be Joao, Mitoma, JPVH, Georginio & Bart. Welbeck robbed of the Aadkurr D’Or"
1729,Brighton,"Honestly, although everyone has been phenomenal this year, Baleba has just been frankly ridiculous. He's probably my shout, although Pedro, Rutter, JPVH and Welbeck have also been standouts for me. "
1730,Brighton,"Gotta give some love to Welbz. He’s been playing out of his mind, and he’s making Georginio and JP better out there. Always impressed with Welbeck's linkup play up top."
1731,Brighton,"Baleba, welbeck , van hecke, Jp and mitoma add bart and that’s a perfect list imo"
1732,Brighton,Verbruggen for me. 
1733,Brighton,You could literally name any of the regular starters and it’d be reasonable. That how freakishly good we are at the moment 😂 
1734,Brighton,"We obviously need to see more, but I'm already a huge fan of Matt O'Riley and his style of play. Georginho has also been a wonderfully pleasant surprise in the attack. JPVH is looking like the future of the back line, Mitoma and Joao Pedro are bringing consistent quality to the front line, and of course Baleba has been fantastic. not to mention we have a killer keeper in Bart. 

Hard to pick just one as the ""best"" so far, but I guess I'd have to say Baleba. "
1735,Brighton,"Best players so far: Welbeck, Bart, Georginio, Baleba, Mitoma and JPVH. 

And if they can roll out this 4-2-3-1 team, they can beat anyone:

Bart  
Veltman, Dunk, JPVH, Kadioglu  
Baleba, Hinshelwood  
Georginio, Joao Pedro, Mitoma  
Welbeck

And that leaves Adingra, Igor, Ferguson, Estupinan, Ayari, and O'Riley on the bench (among others). The depth on this team is incredible. I hope it holds up! We're not seriously pretending Ferdi starts at LB over Pervis are we? Don't forget Minteh!"
1736,Brighton,"Top 5 for me is:

1) Baleba

2) Welbeck

3) Pedro

4) Mitoma

5) Van Hecke

Honourable mentions go to Rutter, Veltman and Igor. "
1737,Brighton,Nice try Chelsea scout 😂😂😂
1738,Brighton,"van Hecke, the 2 league games we were without him we conceded 6 goals, with him in the side we average 1 goal conceded per game


Bart is the best keeper in the league alongside Onana and Alisson as well "
1739,Brighton,"Verbruggen, JPVH, Baleba, Welbeck "
1740,Brighton,there's nobody better 
1741,Brighton,"Pedro, Van Hecke, Verbruggen, Baleba "
1742,Brighton,Welbeck robbed of the Aadkurr D’Or 
1743,Brighton,Always impressed with Welbeck's linkup play up top. 
1744,Brighton,add bart and that’s a perfect list imo 
1745,Brighton,"We're not seriously pretending Ferdi starts at LB over Pervis are we? Igor also I think should start over dunk  If you look at stats adjusted for playing time, Ferdi has more shots blocked, clearances, and goals than Pervis. He has relatively the same number of tackles, interceptions, and fouls. And he has less yellow cards. Pervis has won more headers than Ferdi. When you compare them to Igor, it's not even close. 

I included Dunk because of experience. He is a steadying force, similar to what JPVH is developing into. If you go on stats, he's definitely benched and I would replace him with Pervis."
1746,Brighton,Don't forget Minteh! 
1747,Brighton,😂😂😂 
1748,Brighton,Igor also I think should start over dunk

that 1 goal in the league he was playing as an attacker on the right, and although i see where you're coming from, mitoma just isn't as effective without estupinan and for me that partnership has been crucial."

1751,Brighton,Good point! 
1752,Brighton,"It would take an unprecedented run of form for us to challenge for a title.

But I like our team and our coach. It could happen! "
1753,Brighton,"What was Leicester's chance after 12 games I wonder Yeah, but what happened to them after?"
1754,Brighton,"Goddamn Salah is ripped  

2nd place race is real though!  i was staring at his arm for like 2 minutes when i first saw this Heard he's got pretty bad asthma"
1755,Brighton,"There is a 0.0% chance I will ever look as good as Salah with my shirt off. If you are lazy, sure"
1756,Brighton,I swiped 😔 i wiped 😼
1757,Brighton,We are MASSIVE 
1758,Brighton,"I've got £7 on it with a £2k payout. 

Yes, I pray to Tony Bloom every night. "
1759,Brighton,God damn Salah 
1760,Brighton,Would be funny ngl. 
1761,Brighton,"I think these odds understate our chance.  Hear me out.  All it takes is for a few key things to happen.  Obviously the team has to perform well, which we've done on a tough opening 12 games.  The team starts to gell more and more. New arrivals hit form. We don't have too many injuries but we can suffer a few. And then, most importantly, the teams above us have to slip up a bit.  Citeh and Arsenal have already shown some wobbles.  Chelsea are not a tight unit. Liverpool could have some key injuries. I give us a 0.5% probability.  Or put another way if we were to run this season 200 times, we'd win one.  I believe! Also, I'd give us a 4% chance at second place. Let’s start with europe i do wonder how the numbers in the graphic were calculated"
1762,Brighton,"Not even thinking about a title run right now, the likelihood is just very very low.  However, top 4 is within reach given our form and upcoming schedule.  Just really fun to think about considering that 4-7 years ago we just wanted to stay up.
Gotta get 3 points Friday if we're serious about a top 4 run. "
1763,Brighton,Salahs packing 
1764,Brighton,makes you think if that wolves comeback didnt happen we would have been 2nd place currently Arguably that was necessary both to galvanise the team at the back and give FH a bit of a wake up call about playing all out attack when winning a game. That 4 on 1 that led to the last Wolves goal would have taught all the lads rushing forward a lesson. Still annoying mind.
1765,Brighton,"Damn I mean we still have months to go in the season.. with those odds, are they really just ready to hand the trophy off to Liverpool? "
1766,Brighton,![gif](giphy|ToMjGpKniGqRNLGBrhu) 
1767,Brighton,Pretty much everyone i speak to is certain we're getting top 6. Champions League would be too much for me to comprehend. 
1768,Brighton,"None of the teams I support won anything in last 10 years, I can leave you guys if it will boost our chabce "
1769,Brighton,"if 1% is 1 out of 100, then .1% is 1 out of 1000. 

I'll take those odds! lol. 

honestly, if city continues to drop points, who knows... it feels like anyone can beat anyone this year... "
1770,Brighton,"yoooo Brighton has a reddit🤣🤣🤣
oh my days W club🤣😭🔥 "
1771,Brighton,"Hell yeah. 

I’m happy with that. "
1772,Brighton,Liverpool be hitting the target hard. Is 76% really their percentage ?? JTOL wtf is ur account
1773,Brighton,"Yeah, but what happened to them after? I mean if you offered me a league title and an FA cup in exchange for relegation I'd take that in a heartbeat lol"

1788,Brighton,Are you sure? 
1789,Brighton,"You technically don’t need to buy 2 MyAlbion+ memberships if you register them as a guest and buy through the guest window. But, if you want to guarantee tickets then your way is probably safest.

Best way to get to the stadium is a short train journey from Brighton to Falmer - which is free with a match day ticket. You won’t miss it as all the fans will be funnelled in the same queue so just follow the blue and white tops. 

I’d get there an 1hr-1hr 30mins beforehand. You can take a look around the club store and get food/drink. The new fan zone might be open by then too (not sure on the launch but it’s coming soon). Players will be warming up and you can get a pie which is decent! No tailgating, fans tend to drink in pubs before games.

It’s very safe for family, if you want to be really careful then you can go for the East stand. West stand is also pretty chill but a bit more atmosphere. North stand is the best for atmosphere but if you want a more relaxed stand then avoid this and any seats close to the away fans (south). 

You’ll pick up on the songs, it’s mostly ‘albioooon, albioooon’, ‘seagullssss’ etc. so not exactly hard to pick up. The lyrics will be shown for ‘Sussex by the sea’ so you can join in on that when the game starts. 

You can eat and drink soft drinks at your seat, you can’t drink alcohol at your seat. 

No scams I can think of, it’s pretty straightforward. I’d avoid most of the stadium food apart from the pies as it’s going to be pretty overpriced. But if you have no other options then it’s there. Definitely make the most of Brighton while you’re down - the pier should be good fun for your kid and the laines are fun to look around. 

What game are you shooting for? "
1790,Brighton,😂😂😂 
1791,Brighton,"how do you check that? it's on the reddit recap, there should be a picture of a banana next to your profile"

1795,Brighton,"From today's articles, Crawley Town ladies and gentlemen...


*The details that Faal has described to The Athletic include:*


*Being falsely told by the club that he had failed his medical, which he says they later explained as a “miscommunication”*

*Crawley telling him ‘no negotiating’ on a contract which would be found invalid by the English Football League

At least they've settled on the biggest team out of the 3. Lmaooo you noticed!"

Love how we’ve been performing so far but unless we can start picking up points against the teams on the lower end of the table we’ll struggle to keep up the pace. I see us fighting for that 5th-8th place spots potentially and the start we’ve had will be a huge help for that. Yeah that's all well and good but this isn't even our final form, we still have not played with our best playing 11 yet , with matt , pedro coming back and gomez joining us later, could see us going all the way"

1811,Brighton,"Quick tip: it's not ""go seagulls"" it's just ""SEEEEEEEEAAAAGULLS!"" though we'd also accept ""alllbiiioooon""

Welcome to the journey, we've come a long way to get to this point! We're playing amazing football at the moment but keep your defences high- there is a pecking order in the Premier League and we're a popular team for players to be poached from. 

I'm a believer though and I think once my city can consistently stay in European competitions we can challenge the top just by being run by the most passionate genius' in football! 

UTA! SEEEEEEEEAAAAGULLS!, got it. "
1812,Brighton,Up The Albion is also acceptable Only if you buy me dinner first.
1813,Brighton,"Shoot, my Sussex raised and lifelong Seagulls supporting spouse used to travel to Cincinnati for meetings (alas, all moved online now). Wish he'd known about this - he would have been mighty chuffed to see it!  Thanks for your great post, it did Brighton my day! ![img](emote|t5_2ubcf|32567)

UTA!! Must have been P&G related"
1814,Brighton,Ah that’s so cute! 
1815,Brighton,Wooooo!! US fans!!! 
1816,Brighton,"Yo, you another Bengal/Seagull fan?! Yes, I support the Bengals. If it weren't for Burrow I'd be out for the season, he is special. If they shut him down for the year I'll probably tune out until next year. Just kidding I'll still watch and suffer."
1817,Brighton,Another Cincy fan checking in- cheers! 
1818,Brighton,Another US-based fan here! They're the most exciting club in the PL and you won't be disappointed. 
1819,Brighton,Another Cincinnati fan here....sounds like we're multiplying!  UTA!!! 
1820,Brighton,"Also a new fan from the States. I started following the Premier League last fall and chose Brighton to root for because of the owner, the history, the fans, the diversity of the players, and how they cultivate talent. The end of last season was disappointing but man, this year has been fun to watch! Georginio and Baleba have been gamechangers, Fabian Hürzeler has been a godsend, and it's been awesome seeing Welbeck thrive with their more aggressive attack. Hoping it lasts! "
1821,Brighton,"My aunt/uncle live in Milford :-)  Former Ohioan here, welcome! "
1822,Brighton,Love hearing about people across the world who support our club! Welcome aboard :)

1830,Brighton,Yes indeed I do. The music is an interesting choice tho.. It’s “We have explosives” from The Future Sound of London. It featured on the OST of WipE’out” 1995. I play racing games a fair amount so I enjoy Electronic music

1838,Brighton,And yes the pun with the grenade and the song title was intentional 
1839,Brighton,"Yes Appreciate the brevity. 

In the end, I just want to see him getting his minutes. I’d rather he face the best competition because he’s top level talent.

The beauty of this game is that the despair you feel when a favored player moves on or struggles with injuries is supplemented by the joy of watching new young talent like Joao Pedro or Jack Hinselwood, and seeing a guy like Danny Welbeck playing with youthful energy and poise."
1840,Brighton,"Far to low for him but I respect your optimism 😭 That was my perception too, obviously any team below the championship would benefit from having his presence up front. 

I could see how any premier league player of his talent dropping too far down the football pyramid might have the potential to derail their career rather than getting them back on track."
1841,Brighton,"Hate to say it but this is peak yank right here lol

Big ferg is so much better than wrexham level, championship might honestly be too low as well, it’s a shame I think we’ve hit our limit on loaning to other PL sides. He just needs to be in a system that feeds him for a while I’ll own that I’m embarrassingly American. 

We are a football starved culture in America, currently in an age of football enlightenment. That might be a laughable illustration in a culture where our sport plays a dominant role.

Regardless, apologies for the faux pas.

No argument on Ferguson being too talented for league one. 

The basis of the discussion was well-intended (I just want to see Ferg getting minutes) while also admitting that it seemed like an unlikely scenario to entertain."
1842,Brighton,Jesus Christ 
1843,Brighton,"I think Americans have been tricked into thinking Wrexham are much bigger than they really are. They are way below Ferguson's level.

Ferguson is capable of playing at a Premier League level, he just needs to find a loan that suits his play style. I think Southampton could work well.

Although I haven't seen a single reliable source say he wants to leave. American here, not all of us are like this 😅 I will be the first to admit that I am embarrassingly American. I can tell by the comments here that I lack perspective and have a lot to learn about football in the UK.

Nothing personal, but I think you are misreading the larger American perspective on Wrexham. 

I can only speak for my ilk, which is adults who grew up playing and loving football and being mocked for loving a sport that had little to no culture significance (here, anyway). 

Wrexham for us isn’t about anything except growing the reach of The Beautiful Game in a culture where most people are too naive to understand that American football wouldn’t even exist without “soccer” being there first.

I live in a small community where starting a youth club created a backlash from the school district because they feared what “soccer” might do to their football program. They literally tried to sue. 

I have to acknowledge that Ryan Reynolds being an owner of Wrexham has done so much to normalize football here, the difference here is measurable.

So, Wrexham is small in the perspective of EFL, and may even be loathsome to people in close proximity.

In perspective, I did say that Ferguson at Wrexham was a pipe dream unlikely to happen, but I would never want that to hurt his long term growth or career. 

In the end, I want one of my (and my son’s) favorite players to get his minutes. If that can’t happen at Brighton, I’d love to be able to at least watch him play."
1844,Brighton,"As a fellow yank / fellow fan of both brighton and wrexham / player of way-too-much football manager - a loan to a league one club like Wrexham (or in Okonkwo's case, a league two club at the time) is a move that would benefit the development of an U21 player who's well below Evan's skill level and confidence. I think it's especially an important move for an U21 keeper like Okonwko because they have zero chance of getting consistent game time or competitive experience other than Premier League 2 (the U21 league) or the very occasional cup game when a backup keeper is injured, and consistent game time is crucial for someone hoping to make the jump to the first team. Big Arth was such an important get for Wrexham, but the reality is that he didn't have much future left at Arsenal (I'm not totally sure if he was released and signed on a free after his loan, or if he was actually sold to Wrexham, but either way that was going to be the end of his time on a premier league side... for now 😉). 

A League One loan wouldn't be realistic for someone at Evan's level (raw, but already in the first team and competing for game time) but would be more suited to academy players like Cam Peupion (who was loaned to league two Cheltenham) or Caylan Vickers (signed this year from league one Reading). "
1845,Brighton, Americans really do make me laugh sometimes I can only hope that the laughter causes you to smile and that it’s seen as an endearing quality. 😅
1846,Brighton,"Ultimately it's up to him but there's good non-football reasons to go. 


If all he needs is minutes he'll never get the kind of global media exposure that he'd get at Wrexham from any championship-level club. This could pay dividends if he wants to become a superstar ""face of Irish football.""

But the quality of competition does matter. If he thinks he needs to refine his game against better competition and keep his head down, he needs to get loaned into a top league. I could see him in a struggling Serie A or Bundesliga side. Roma would be an interesting choice. Maybe we loan him to St. Pauli as a thank you for Fabian?

Either way I don't think he'll end up in the Championship. I appreciate this perspective more than I can articulate. He’s an impressive young man, and I don’t doubt that there would be a net positive for him to be in a situation like that. 

It’s a good reminder to me that ultimately I want to see him succeed, whether that’s at Brighton or somewhere else. The competition that he’d face beneath the top tier won’t help him grow.

Cheers"
1847,Brighton,"Forgot to mention, I’m aware that there may be a perceived stigma in the UK about top level talent dropping down the EPL pyramid to play, but I honestly don’t know how prevalent that is.

Please feel free to enlighten me, as I am admittedly naive about this. It’s seen pretty universally as a sign you can’t hack it in the premier league and is generally associated with very young or very old players.

If you want to play premier league football you need to be playing premier league football, Which I appreciate sounds paradoxical. You generally want to be playing against the best to improve yourself. He could go tear up the national league or league 2 and get 30 goals but it wouldn’t be seen as positive to his career."
1848,Brighton,"Thank you! I really appreciate the shared perspective. 

I went into this believing that there was an honest discussion that could be had about how a player loan might be equitable to “playing in the minor leagues” for a short “rehab stint” after injury (baseball analogy, for anyone unfamiliar) and then a player of Ferguson’s caliber would be back to the premier league quickly, given his dominance at a lower tier.

I now understand that analogy was patently flawed. "
1849,Brighton,"I doubt he'll actually go. Wrexham would be awful for him apart from statpadding. He'd be banging in every shot against Stevenage. Would normally say someone would likely attempt to injure him but he looks like a tough, strong lad. "
1850,Brighton,This is a 50 million pound player. We're not sending him to League One 
1851,Brighton,"To be longer winded that the exceptional SEAtoPAR response (which made me laugh out loud), Wrexham are not a good destination regardless of how many minutes he might get or how popular the club are. 

In baseball, injured or other players returning from time away from the game may go to AA or even A ball to get their timing back and take some swings in a low-pressure environment. That's usually for 15-30 days or so. Players who are scuffling on the edge of the majors might get sent down for a few weeks to get their grove back, or not be called up until at bats are there for the taking. 

Loans in football are for at least 1/2 a season (January to May in this case). Evan will get minutes in the FA Cup matches, but if Brighton loan him out in January, that's it for him until next campaign. That's a big window, so a loan will only take place if it suits all parties. In the player's case he wants minutes at the highest competitive level in a spot that will make him look good - either to Brighton or to a potential suitor who will pay big money for him. In the club's case they want him to get minutes and get better. Sending him to a AA or A club like Wrexham might get him some goals but he's not going to be going against good opposition. He'll be going into scrappy unsophisticated matches for the most part, like against the mindless thugs of Crawley Town, who will look to teach the lad a thing or two for being a star. 

Unlike younger players who are coming up the ladder, Evan doesn't need to prove he's PL ready. He clearly can play on the international and PL stage. He wants minutes to keep sharp and continue his growth. 

It will take a very special situation in my opinion for EF to go out on loan. He's tremendous asset that needs to go to a high level club but not a rival, a club who will keep him fresh but not turn his head. And that's ONLY if BHA feel like the don't need him in any case. Evan might not be happy with 10 minutes at the end of games, but Welbz is only one hammy on a cold night in Stoke from being on the shelf for 8 weeks. Wait your turn lad, and keep doing the work. See Pepi, Ricardo as an American example. 

Think if your very attractive wife wanted to go to a big company event that was important to her career at the company and you couldn't go. You'd be ok with her going with her brother, or a gay friend. But not her divorced co-worker and not the young handsome single guy from marketing. And neither of you would want her going with your sloppy drunk younger brother. 

So back to the original question - Yes, Wrexham (and 97% of other clubs out there) are beneath him. "

That pass from Pedro for Mitoma yesterday was unreal. Very true. However I also thought we’d lose at Bournemouth… We came out with 10 the last time we played all of those teams  Liverpool has seemed to be our only issue this year in terms of top of the table some bottom feeders have gave us a problem We have to realize that we are a different kind of Brighton now! 😎 MAYBE OLD BRIGHTON Not this team. This team is really becoming something else we shooting for the title screw the naysayers and doubters. I straight up Believe we can win the league. We want champions league nothing less if we be consistent and work hard together we have what it takes to finish in a champions league spot and If Liverpool slips up at all its on we can challenge for the title. Only thing Im worried about and that I feel like could stop this from happening is injuries but we seem to be managing and looking after our players if they do get an injury so Im happy. UTA!

1885,Brighton,"I like to believe we wouldve bottled bournemouth if we didnt bottle wolves, helps me sleep The ecstasy of beating city and contributing to the bald fraud’s record losing streak is more than enough to paper over the wolves bottlejob. Beating the cheeky cherries away is icing."
1886,Brighton,"it’s crazy to think if we won the games we didn’t win, we’d be doing bettter 🤯 😂😂😂😂"
1887,Brighton,Even just if that pass against wolves was just two metres to the left 
1888,Brighton,"This has been the case for years but having Welbeck, Rutter and Pedro in attack makes me feel good about breaking down defence.

That pass from Pedro for Mitoma yesterday was unreal. 100% Joao Pedro is the missing puzzle piece. We good now. If he didn't get injured we would be in second rn. Algood though hes back now letsss goo champions league here we come!"
1889,Brighton,Very true. However I also thought we’d lose at Bournemouth… 
1890,Brighton,We came out with 10 the last time we played all of those teams  Liverpool has seemed to be our only issue this year in terms of top of the table some bottom feeders have gave us a problem 
1891,Brighton,We have to realize that we are a different kind of Brighton now! 😎 
1892,Brighton,MAYBE OLD BRIGHTON Not this team. This team is really becoming something else we shooting for the title screw the naysayers and doubters. I straight up Believe we can win the league. We want champions league nothing less if we be consistent and work hard together we have what it takes to finish in a champions league spot and If Liverpool slips up at all its on we can challenge for the title. Only thing Im worried about and that I feel like could stop this from happening is injuries but we seem to be managing and looking after our players if they do get an injury so Im happy. UTA! 
1893,Brighton,"Yeah, our track record playing teams literally at the bottom of the table is not great, but hopefully we're seeing the beginning of the end of that curse 6 wins against relegation sides in 47 PL games I believe, lol."
1894,Brighton,"I'm 38 LOL.

I've been around too long to get my hopes up too high. (Losing a play off to a shit Palace team will do that). 

But to dream and to fantasise about? Why not. "
1895,Brighton,The ecstasy of beating city and contributing to the bald fraud’s record losing streak is more than enough to paper over the wolves bottlejob. Beating the cheeky cherries away is icing. 
1896,Brighton,😂😂😂😂 
1897,Brighton,100% Joao Pedro is the missing puzzle piece. We good now. If he didn't get injured we would be in second rn. Algood though hes back now letsss goo champions league here we come! 
1898,Brighton,"6 wins against relegation sides in 47 PL games I believe, lol. "
1899,Brighton,"He'd get less game time there than here. They just want to sign him onto a 30 year contract Yeah but if I’m gonna warm a bench, I’d rather be minted doing it…"
1900,Brighton,100 million take it and run Tony will make it 150 million and a percentage of all future sales 🤣 Bargain
1901,Brighton,If they pay more than 50m I say take it. 
1902,Brighton,"Chelsea has interest? 

Alexa play “here comes the money” "
1903,Brighton,You bet they do. 
1904,Brighton,Who aren't they interested in anyways? 
1905,Brighton,They just want to sign him onto a 30 year contract they need to continue their 115 players strategy they can't do that anymore... 5 years max
1906,Brighton,"Yeah but if I’m gonna warm a bench, I’d rather be minted doing it… You'd feel a whole lot better about not starting when sat in your new Lamborghini."
1907,Brighton,Tony will make it 150 million and a percentage of all future sales 🤣 
1908,Brighton,Bargain 
1909,Brighton,they need to continue their 115 players strategy Dressing room feels empty if they aren’t doubled up on cubbies
1910,Brighton,they can't do that anymore... 5 years max 
1911,Brighton,You'd feel a whole lot better about not starting when sat in your new Lamborghini.

1914,Brighton,Out of all the relegation candidates theyre the one we should theoretically put the sword based on the way they play. But yknow what Brighton are like. 1-1 
1915,Brighton,that's a beautiful counter at 56' Truly. Dibling by far their best player this match IMO
1916,Brighton,"Their keeper has made some baffling decisions It's the wind I reckon. Yup, he just conceded one with a bad one..."
1917,Brighton,Lallana left with a hamstring injury; he'll probably be a doubt for us 
1918,Brighton,They scored two against Liverpool. They are not pushovers. 
1919,Brighton,They are pants. We will kill them. Sweet summer child!
1920,Brighton,Main takeaways were their quick counters which we've improved at defending; their sloppy play out the back; but also their fight. This could be one where we go up a few then start to concede if we aren't careful. 
1921,Brighton,"Lallana will be fit and play for the full 90 mins…..

Although tbh he will prob do a hamstring shaking hands at the line up. "
1922,Brighton,Truly. Dibling by far their best player this match IMO 
1923,Brighton,It's the wind I reckon. 
1924,Brighton,"Yup, he just conceded one with a bad one... "
1925,Brighton,Sweet summer child! 
1926,Brighton,"I normally try to get a stream link for you guys, but for the life of me I can’t find one. Perhaps faplayer.tv - not sure if it works though. Best of luck ladies! "
1927,Brighton,"15 games in and hes already being linked with a move away. thats a pretty good indicator of how hes doing. hope he stays a long long time. Yeah, one season would definitely be too short. Hopefully bigger clubs stay away and he stays a while I’m hoping we can hold on to him by pricing out clubs with a massive price tag. He seems happy here."
1928,Brighton,"Great morning read as always good job! Really hope enciso and Ferguson can get back to form either for us or out on loan Thanks so much! And agreed about Enciso and Ferguson. I’d be happy with an Enciso loan, but I really hope Ferguson regains his form and stays with us this season. 

I worry a loan could be the first step to us losing him permanently before he hits his full potential at Brighton. Probably an irrational fear, but I’m worried about it with how many clubs have been supposedly keeping tabs on him for so long"
1929,Brighton,"Hey Everyone, 

I’m back with another news roundup. A relatively small one this week, but there are some interesting stories in here. The biggest being that Evan Ferguson reportedly wants to leave on loan in January. Let me know what you think!

1930,Brighton,"As a neutral I think Brighton is still the best place for him to play. Injuries did him dirty and I think he will strive as Brighton won't be able to hold Welbeck in this form forever and Joao Pedro for more then 2-3 years - his prime is still not there to be expected within the next 2-3 years so he should be fine. Problem is its not just a matter of Welbeck getting old or injured. Its about performance. The role that Welbeck plays in link up and the then in finishing, is amazing. Ferguson's game is still relatively crude in comparson. He is improving but no means can assume that the team wwould function acceptably with him in Welbeck's role.

So he has a job to do to improve actually. Yeah with Pedro playing the 10 it's basically between Welbeck & Ferguson for the 9 & with Christmas around the corner, you're not gonna have a 33 year old play 3 times a week. 

As an Ireland fan, the talk around Fergo is maddening half the time with the loudest voices being people who never watch him. His finishing & movement is top tier & the class ball he played to Szmodics against Finland is a sign of his link up getting up a gear. 

People will slate his form but Newcastle was a tough game for everyone & Wolves is the only Prem game he played more than 10 min. Welbz is in the form of his life though, so it's obviously a hard spot to take. But he's gonna get a chance there before January"
1931,Brighton,I may be in a minority but I really don't see what all the fuss is about Ferguson and although injuries have certainly played a part I'm not yet convinced he'll become the real deal. 
1932,Brighton,"Would love to see Ferguson  brave the continent, Serie A would he great. Juve in particular are very light up front, he could easily displace Vlahovic and Milik. Fantasy would be Zirkzee out, Evan in. 

Either way, would be great to see him, and Kelleher find first team football. I'd say Brentford will be in for the latter. "
1933,Brighton,"Like, just watch Delap.  This is where Evan should be, but he needs to play.  Clearly there's no interest in playing him here... "
1934,Brighton,"Yeah, one season would definitely be too short. Hopefully bigger clubs stay away and he stays a while Yeah. respectfully, they can keep their grubby hands off him"
1935,Brighton,I’m hoping we can hold on to him by pricing out clubs with a massive price tag. He seems happy here. He was very obviously unsettled by Joao Pedro coming in at all. And more so by him settling in so well and starting.
1936,Brighton,"Thanks so much! And agreed about Enciso and Ferguson. I’d be happy with an Enciso loan, but I really hope Ferguson regains his form and stays with us this season. 

I worry a loan could be the first step to us losing him permanently before he hits his full potential at Brighton. Probably an irrational fear, but I’m worried about it with how many clubs have been supposedly keeping tabs on him for so long No form being regained without being played or passed to."
1937,Brighton,"Problem is its not just a matter of Welbeck getting old or injured. Its about performance. The role that Welbeck plays in link up and the then in finishing, is amazing. Ferguson's game is still relatively crude in comparson. He is improving but no means can assume that the team wwould function acceptably with him in Welbeck's role.

So he has a job to do to improve actually. "
1938,Brighton,"Yeah with Pedro playing the 10 it's basically between Welbeck & Ferguson for the 9 & with Christmas around the corner, you're not gonna have a 33 year old play 3 times a week.

1939,Brighton,"Yeah. respectfully, they can keep their grubby hands off him "
1940,Brighton,"He was very obviously unsettled by Joao Pedro coming in at all. And more so by him settling in so well and starting. Who
Ferguson?"
1941,Brighton,No form being regained without being played or passed to. 
1942,Brighton,"Who
Ferguson? "
1943,Brighton,"Maybe leicester or southampton. I'd probably just prefer if he could find a more attacking team in another league. I feel like the style matching and the mood being positive is more important than him playing in this league. I would love Leicester but I do not believe it is allowed, agree to disagree about the league but. I believe he needs a prem club."
1944,Brighton,"I'd greatly prefer a slightly weaker league where he can start every week and play in a team more stylistically similar to us. No point sending him to a weak prem team where he won't get service most of the time. A team in the top third of the championship might even be preferable (although that hasn't helped sarmiento get minutes). Blackburn fan checking in here. Yes, please! Attacking, creative team with no-one to finish the chances. Plus van Hecke and Ayari have done well here recently."
1945,Brighton,"I really don't think he'd leave tbh.

He's one injury away from starting. Doubt that. Hürzeler prefers Welbeck, Pedro and even Rutter as a striker.
He’s got loads of potential but he just doesn’t fit in out playing style atm He can't compete with Welbeck in this system though, doubt he wants to rot on the bench till an injury."
1946,Brighton,"Send him to the fucking championship and let him bang goals in for fun. Get his confidence up. The problem is he doesn’t work with our system and never fucking has. Who knows, maybe they fix that in the future, but currently he’s just slowly pressing, offering no hold up play and hoping to get a shot off. "
1947,Brighton,"Think this will be a huge regret. Welbeck can go out for the season at any game. Evan should be getting more minutes and starts here and there in this busy period.

  
He was being compared to Kane and being called the next 100m player a couple years ago. Rutter and Pedro can both play striker if needed. Honestly, our striker plays more of a 2nd #10 role than a proper striker anyway, which is part of Ferguson's issue here at the moment. He won't excel here unless he becomes more patient in possession or our attack adapts to having a pure finisher om the pitch."
1948,Brighton,"Can’t really see him walking into any PL side right now tbh. Everton have DCL, Beto, and Broja who will be coming back from injury soon. 

Leicester, Southampton, and Ipswich Town either already have too many players on loan or other forwards I think they like better.

Who knows though. If he just wants a better opportunity to compete than he has now, maybe he’d be open to a move somewhere that he’s not guaranteed to start. "
1949,Brighton,"I think him going on loan to a competitive championship club would be a great step and a better fit for the playing time he needs and the level he's at. He's one injury away from starting here, but unless that happens, Welbeck has to be first choice, he's in the form of his life with not many seasons left where that'll be possible. If something were to happen injury wise, Rutter and Joao Pedro and our small army of wingers have more than enough attacking power to compensate. He needs game time and confidence to build on his potential and a few minutes at the tail end of games isn't going to cut it. Then in a season or two he's ready to be the obvious starting choice (or, worst case scenario, it'll be clear he was never going to be). "
1950,Brighton,Dortmund for 6 months or so would be interesting 
1951,Brighton,I don't see any way he'd be going out on loan. If he leaves it'll be because we've cashed him in. 
1952,Brighton,"I would love Leicester but I do not believe it is allowed, agree to disagree about the league but. I believe he needs a prem club. This is correct. PL clubs are only allowed two loans players at one time from other PL clubs and both players can’t be on loan from the same club. Leicester would have to terminate Buonanotte’s loan."
1953,Brighton,"Blackburn fan checking in here. Yes, please! Attacking, creative team with no-one to finish the chances. Plus van Hecke and Ayari have done well here recently. "
1954,Brighton,"Doubt that. Hürzeler prefers Welbeck, Pedro and even Rutter as a striker.

1957,Brighton,This is correct. PL clubs are only allowed two loans players at one time from other PL clubs and both players can’t be on loan from the same club. Leicester would have to terminate Buonanotte’s loan. 
1958,Brighton,"Points after 12 games: 

▫️24/25: 22 

▫️23/24: 19

▫️22/23: 21

▫️21/22: 17

▫️20/21: 10

▫️19/20: 15

▫️18/19: 14

▫️17/18: 16 Must be said that 23/24 had European games also. Took its toll in the latter half of the season."
1959,Brighton,That includes a home draw against Ipswich and the Wolves debacle. Crazy to think if we had been more locked in we would be a top 2 team Ipswich can draw against anyone. and still playing every big 6 team in that time as well
1960,Brighton,"Even the most optimistic fan would have struggled to predict this. I think what is brilliant is there are still areas of improvement, time needed to settle everyone in, headroom for growth for players and players coming back in injury.

Verbruggen is settled now, Estupinian starting to come back to his best, Ayari and Baleba werent meant to be this seasons high flying midfield, Enciso and Ferguson picking up form again for national teams, and hopefully Kadioglu/ Minteh/ Hinsh and March can all hit ground running again when back from injury.

As we approach January i cant see glaring areas that need addition, an out and out RB who can compete with Veltman would be the main consideration but i dont think it will be a critical issue if we dont. Wow and no mention of dunk either. We won’t b making any signings in the next few windows"
1961,Brighton,"im brand new to football and I randomly picked Brighton as my team before the season started so I'd like to take at least some credit for this. How random was it? Same lol, but i picked brighton randomly last year"
1962,Brighton,![gif](giphy|Jlt69Ka6SwtH2|downsized) 
1963,Brighton,I’m a very big fan of hurlezer 
1964,Brighton,your honor i love him 
1965,Brighton,Think I might agree 
1966,Brighton,"The man with the spreadsheet comparing like-for-like fixtures will also tell you that the same fixtures last year gave the Seagulls 10 points with a -11 GD (This year, 22 points with a +5 differential). POUR IT ON LADS. "
1967,Brighton,Must be said that 23/24 had European games also. Took its toll in the latter half of the season. We also didn’t recruit a lot and some were absolute dire tripe (Dahoud) Ask Villa now. Taking its toll on them as well
1968,Brighton,Crazy to think if we had been more locked in we would be a top 2 team 
1969,Brighton,Ipswich can draw against anyone. 
1970,Brighton,and still playing every big 6 team in that time as well 
1971,Brighton,"Wow and no mention of dunk either. Testament to how good Igor has been.

Also good signs with McConville (think I may have spelt that wrong), who I've seen touted as a young version of Dunk, getting picked for Northern Ireland and doing well in the U21s I’m glad Dunk is out. l like Igor starting"
1972,Brighton,We won’t b making any signings in the next few windows Diego Gomez?
1973,Brighton,How random was it? I’m Canadian and don’t know anything about the sport so I just googled who to cheer for as a new fan and a YouTube video suggested Brighton as a fun well run team so I checked out their first game and I got hooked.
1974,Brighton,"Same lol, but i picked brighton randomly last year "
1975,Brighton,We also didn’t recruit a lot and some were absolute dire tripe (Dahoud)

1978,Brighton,I’m glad Dunk is out. l like Igor starting 
1979,Brighton,Diego Gomez? I suppose technically he’s already signed with us but joining in January

1981,Brighton,I suppose technically he’s already signed with us but joining in January 
1982,Brighton,Good for u. Join the Seagulls family 
1983,Brighton,Fat asian? What?
1984,Brighton,What? That's a no lol. I picked Brighton from the_fat_asian's clueless Americans guide to the EPL where he made the same argument.
1985,Brighton,That's a no lol. I picked Brighton from the_fat_asian's clueless Americans guide to the EPL where he made the same argument. Oh actually yeah you’re right it was fat asian I didn’t know the name. I just rechecked the video I watched
1986,Brighton,Oh actually yeah you’re right it was fat asian I didn’t know the name. I just rechecked the video I watched Nice! Sidenote I'm an NSC fan also so since you're Canadian I just have to thank you for Jacob Shaffelburg.
1987,Brighton,Nice! Sidenote I'm an NSC fan also so since you're Canadian I just have to thank you for Jacob Shaffelburg. I haven’t watched any mls yet to be honest but you’re welcome
1988,Brighton,I haven’t watched any mls yet to be honest but you’re welcome 
1989,Brighton,Glad I'm not the only one who noticed. 
1990,Brighton,"actually so proud of him, especially after all the vitriol against him "
1991,Brighton,"I'm very pleased for him. His recent comment that it's more difficult to gauge and meet the pace of the game when coming on a substitute told me that he's honest and self-reflective of his own game, including weaknesses. Also bravo to FH for immediately bringing  on Wieffer and Adingra for Pedro and Rutter once Baleba was red carded. FH showed conviction in his back-up game plans. "
1992,Brighton,He put in a shift. He was solid and will be solid. 
1993,Brighton,"I'm happy he ignored the vicious keyboard warrior attacks from basement dwelling attention deficit disorder teens, who seem to plague all football forums. He'll be good for the Albion. "
1994,Brighton,Great defensive display 
1995,Brighton,His first touch on Saturday was bad but as he settled in he impressed for sure. 
1996,Brighton,"It would be the most brighton thing to beat city, spurs, bournemouth then lose to southampton At least they don't have JWP to score a brace like last time. Oldd Brighton Maybe not this team. They weren’t dreadful against Liverpool …"
1997,Brighton,I am expecting a brutal loss 😅 I think like 3-2 loss but they score 2 goals on the last 5 minutes ![gif](giphy|1LTMQhfCdneeJJqM5b)
1998,Brighton,A fixture against the bottom placed team is actually terrifying though 
1999,Brighton,"We’d be second right now even after all other teams had played if we hadn’t bottled the Wolves game Yea, and forest tbh another team that was bottom when we played them. sensing a pattern here."

2003,Brighton,Let’s not get our hopes up…BHA is (quite deservedly) known as the Robin Hood of EPL. 
2004,Brighton,"If it wasn't for fumbling against two other relation battling teams we would already be clear second so I'm not highly confident Of course, thing is, everybody except Liverpool has been dropping points left and right"
2005,Brighton,"We are Brighton & Hove Albion, we indeed can lose to them 2-0 straight 😅 "
2006,Brighton,When is the new bottle factory on the seafront opening? 
2007,Brighton,At least they don't have JWP to score a brace like last time. Nah it’ll be a Lallana brace
2008,Brighton,Oldd Brighton Maybe not this team.

I cheat a bit with the Centre backs, need some good evo’s but this team is competitive, Div 2 and 8-9 wins on rivals Looks really good honestly"
2022,Brighton,After seeing Yankuba playing for a whole year on Feyenoord I just KNOW for the next 5 years he’s gonna be remembered 🙏 
2023,Brighton,I can’t wait for a few more CB evos so I can get Dunk on the pitch. I somehow managed to evo Captain Jack a few times and he’s a monster at CDM and RB

If you play him as a wingback however, he's really good"

2033,Chelsea,"I hate how you somehow managed to get the “your” and “you’re” both wrong He’s just a chill guy that confuses your and you’re. The best part is that the first 'your' is used correctly, and then they messed up the others. Lmao  Thought it was intentional lol He’s just a chill guy. Leave him alone *yro’ue At least their consistent. (I know it’s the wrong they’re) Your a grammar nazi and this world needs you're kind of people! It's just a meme mate

It's not like he's writing something formal"
2034,Chelsea,"You used all the correct forms of your / you’re - just not in the correct places. The chance of him using them all in incorrect places is the same as being correct, and somehow he got it all wrong. It’s like answering a T/F test and got all the questions wrong. Hilarious 😭😭😭 He’s just a chill guy who mixes up your and you’re"
2035,Chelsea,"Clearly wasn't intentional, I don't see how Palmer could've been mad at Noni. I could see a certain 900 goal merchant do it lol"
2036,Chelsea,You might even say he’s a cold guy Fr
2037,Chelsea,That pic of him sat down watching the handbags against Forest is this meme in reality. Fr
2038,Chelsea,"Boggles my mind how many people I’ve seen say Noni should’ve just lifted both feet when he jumped.  Have people never jumped before?  You need at least one foot to push off the ground in order to jump, you can’t just magically levitate into the air without pushing off of the ground.

Sorry had to get that off my chest cuz I heard it on a podcast this morning You can jump with both feet but you’re still right. It’s way quicker to transition from running to a single leg jump than to a two legged jump. I mean you can jump with both feet, but noni was running too so it’s harder Noni can’t just elevate up in the air??? What a scrub! Real talk, Noni did well to lift one leg before even jumping with his standing leg"

2043,Chelsea,"Why is that “chill guy” meme popular? It’s not funny at all You're not a chill guy 🤷🏿‍♂️ Yeah I don't really get it either tbh Just this months meme of choice. The joke mostly depends on the punchline. This one isn't funny, but I like the photoshop effort, and it beats most memes we see on this sub on meme-Tuesdays"
2044,Chelsea,"yah but also thats slightly on him? he could have maybe slowed it for a sec and scored? he is learning what its like to be double marked and kicked around.....he is still showing top class quality, though. really wish he got that goal just for the stats That's what I think too. If people want to blame anyone it should be Palmer."
2045,Chelsea,"Are people seriously stupid enough to talk about this?

Just as Palmer could be mad at Madueke for blocking the shot, Noni could be mad at Cole for shooting at him instead of next to him and into the goal.

It's good that our players are smarter and knew that it was just a bit of bad luck. If we're going to talk about it then I'd rather talk about the runs. 

I think we have a ""Hazard""problem with Cole and it's a good thing. I remember the articles and general verdict being Hazard was too creative to anticipate. It would create funny little instances of block shots or a player looking out of place because Hazard had assumed the position of that player. 

That's exactly what happened here. Cole was in Noni's typical spot. So when Noni made the run to the far post instead of standing his ground you ended up with two players trying to do the same thing. 

Unfortunately that kind of presence of mind to avoid that situation just comes with time. This instance of Chelsea has a better supporting cast than Hazard ever did. Should have gotten our boy a CL medal with Chelsea. I have a strong feeling we don't make that mistake with Cole. Woah lets calm down"

2088,Chelsea,The way madueke takes on all defenders has me excited He can legitimately just walk past his defender when he wants to. If he ever learns to square it once in a while he will be top top top.
2089,Chelsea,"Doesn't worry me too much because he's made huge improvements in this area over the last year.

We can see he's got major talent, can dribble past anyone, but he hasn't been as effective as he could be at times because he's just a little too selfish and either doesn't pass or holds it a second too long sometimes. Tbh gotta give some credit to Poch too because there was a massive difference between Madueke at the start of last season and the end of it.  

This should become better with time too as he grows more experienced and mature. I think we forgot how young the entire team is, no-one is the finished article yet. Genuinely

What is different to Madueke compared to someone like Harvey barnes? I see people say how he dribbles past everyone. Can’t remember the last time he stood his defender up 1v1 and beat him off the dribble. Maybe in acres of open space on the break because he is rapid, but he can’t actually beat his man when the defense is settled imo"
2090,Chelsea,"![gif](giphy|jUwpNzg9IcyrK)

Madueke after blocking Palmers shot "
2091,Chelsea,"The funny thing in the game against Leicester was that after Madueke blocked Palmer’s shot, he became less selfish and tried to pass more often to make up for it That's not uncommon for him. 


He only shoots until people start to become visibly pissed off with him and then he overcompensates and starts passing even when he should be shooting"
2092,Chelsea,"You people are genuinely insufferable, fucking hounding one of our players at every single moment. Haha sure its just a meme but you cant scroll 5 seconds without seeing something negative about the guy. No wonder Moi said he preferred to play away from home "
2093,Chelsea,"You know I doubt Robben always could crack it like that when he cuts in. Maybe it will take some time. 

Imagine him and Misha banging them in from the top of the box over and over lol "
2094,Chelsea,Madueke is a baller and key player in our squad. Don't get all the hate he gets. He brings a lot to the table. 
2095,Chelsea,"Noni is looking for the pass more than he was last year.  Now, I just want him to be more decisive when taking on defenders.  With more teams giving more defensive attention to Palmer, someone needs to be more aggressive. "
2096,Chelsea,When he first got here he didn’t even know passing was an option. It was like the “a” button not existing in Fifa. So he’s been improving. Still not great 
2097,Chelsea,"The idea that madueke is a good dribbler is overblown. Maybe last year he was decent but this year, he hasn't been that good

https://i.redd.it/hilij5hmdd0e1.png

Mudryk, a player most people here would consider shit and can't dribble has the same successful dribbles as madueke I don't think anyone would say mudryk is shit at dribbling. His issues are mental. His positioning and decision making are bad but he's always been able to beat a man"
2098,Chelsea,He can legitimately just walk past his defender when he wants to. If he ever learns to square it once in a while he will be top top top. 
2099,Chelsea,"Genuinely

What is different to Madueke compared to someone like Harvey barnes? Four and a half prime development years for starters. Huh? My whole point was that Madueke is 22 and still developing and you've chosen to compare him to a guy who is 26, which is supposed to be around the age the player becomes the finished article. 

And tbh Noni comes off fine in a comparison between the two of them in stats right now. This year they've both played in 14 games and both have 5 G+A as of right now. 

. For starters, Harvey Barnes passed the ball when he was Madueke’s age."
2100,Chelsea,"I see people say how he dribbles past everyone. Can’t remember the last time he stood his defender up 1v1 and beat him off the dribble.

2102,Chelsea,"I don't think anyone would say mudryk is shit at dribbling. His issues are mental. His positioning and decision making are bad but he's always been able to beat a man Mudryk is an absolutely horrible dribbler

He can beat players for pace and he’s strong enough to take it past them in the middle of the pitch but that isn’t dribbling, dribbling is about close control in tight spaces and Mudryks touch has always let him down in those areas.

there’s a big difference between how Hazard and Sancho dribble compared to Mudryk and Madueke who are both very much in the kick and chase mould not the gifted technically one."
2103,Chelsea,"Four and a half prime development years for starters. Yeah 

It would not at all be surprising for Noni to be way better than Harvey Barnes in 4 years time 

Maresca likes him a lot so he'll get his opportunity to shine here"

2106,Chelsea,"You don't watch games then lol Lotta that around here. A lot of I'm going to send 40 comments into the match thread and not a lot of I'm going to watch the match. He doesn't tho, his successful dribbles per 90 is the same as mduryk in the prem or at least they were before the Leicester game recently, I'm sure it hasn't changed much.

He doesn't take his man on anymore as often and even when he does, he ain't that good anymore, just in the Leicester game, he took his man and dribbled it out of play by himself"

He passed it slightly more.  Very similar player imo He had 10 league assists in his 3rd PL season. How many PL appearance would you guess it take for Madueke to hit double digits in the league, rn he’s on pace to get his 10th on his 230th game."

He’s been injured so much but tbf to barnes he had a great cross on him"

2147,Chelsea,Dude was so underrated. Top CB Dont think I ever saw anyone say he wasn't a great CB. The only thing is that obviously you'd have to say he was just a notch below JTs level. JT brought the defensive organisation and Cahill was a very good partner for him to do that. JTs leadership definitely elevated the levels of players around him particularly in defence.

2165,Chelsea,"Weird stat but okay

If we remove our most important players goal contributions then where would we be? I think it was originally supposed to be about how good Salah is with his contact talks right now. Didn't need to add Chelsea to it. It's almost as if Salah wasn't there, they could play another attacker in his place! Yeah, but people take this as it means something Right behind Liverpool in 14th."
2166,Chelsea,"Great, now take away Palmer’s goals and assists and see where we’d land Well we finished 12th the season before he arrived so.."
2167,Chelsea,I really hate this stat I remember we had same thing last season with Cole Palmers contributions…like these guys some sort of aliens or something . They happened to be part of the 11 on the pitch you know . 
2168,Chelsea,"This just in: Without your lungs, you'd probably not be able to breath and you'll die. "
2169,Chelsea,"Such a useless stat, honestly OK, so it isn't just me. A stat for stat's sake. How is it?

It shows how much they will potentially struggle next season without him. What? This is a good stat that shows how crucial is Salah to Liverpool Your inability to glean the very obvious insight the stat is suggesting says more about you than the utility of the stat"
2170,Chelsea,"Every season, Salah is making us more and more bitter that we sold him. "
2171,Chelsea,"Salah is amazing, an all-time great player. 

But if you remove his wonderful output, you’re just seeing what Liverpool with 10 men get… he’s a massive part of their success, but so is the entire squad’s quality, discipline, style of play and chemistry which has been built over the better part of a decade. 

Weird thing to post here- if we hadn’t of lost to Liverpool and they were docked 17 points then yes, we’d be top of the table and Man City + Arsenal would still be the favourites. 

Maybe if we removed Haaland and Saka too then we’d be looking good! "
2172,Chelsea,Now do Palmer! 
2173,Chelsea,Tf is the point of this 
2174,Chelsea,"I don’t like this cause it’s like okay, remove Cole’s goals and assists from our tally, see where we end up lol "
2175,Chelsea,His passing this season has revolutionised his play.  He’s changed and adapted as he’s aged. Only the very top top players can do that. 
2176,Chelsea,So you’re saying Liverpool without their best player would be worse. Imagine us without Palmer. Probably would have been relegated last season. 
2177,Chelsea,How does removing salahs goals put us above city He scored against us?
2178,Chelsea,This is actually the dumbest stat I’ve ever seen 
2179,Chelsea,I remember when we were called Cole Palmer FC last SZN 
2180,Chelsea,LOL what is this stat I guess someone had nothing to do today 
2181,Chelsea,This is more a compliment to Salah than Chelsea lol 
2182,Chelsea,Is this a stat of Liverpool playing with 10 men? 
2183,Chelsea,"Funny to think thay by this logic, Sanchez is our most important player if every shot on target we faced is counted as a goal. "
2184,Chelsea,This is like saying google is nothing without google search. 
2185,Chelsea,![gif](giphy|L3X9GvVhP1nY23Ah6u) 
2186,Chelsea,That’s gotta be the most ridiculous stat ever. 
2187,Chelsea,"And if my grandma had wheels... But seriously, do people still think teams that consistently win are purely 100% dependent on 1 single individual, the one who is scoring the most? What about the goalkeeper and defenders that try to avoid conceding goals and are busy getting the ball forward to the midfielders? What about the midfielders trying to outrun / outdribble and outpass their opponents occupying the same space in an attempt to create chances for the forwards? What about that winger doing all the work up until the box so someone else can just wait at the right time and right place to tap it in (Haaland). And sure, there are players like Palmer, Salah, Messi, Vini, etc., that create and score a lot of their own chances, but it doesn't happen in isolation from others, it happens because of what the others are doing as well. This isn't the 80s when Maradonna sliced and diced through the opponents all the way from his own half while faking out 8 players, bringing the shame of a thousand forefathers on the opponents' names. Those days are loooooong gone. "
2188,Chelsea,It'd be a better stat if you took every teams best G/A Player out. (Still dumb) 
2189,Chelsea,"These stats are so arbitrary, it's not like they would have played with 10 men if he wasn't on the pitch, they'd have scored plenty of goals still

At the absolute worst, they'd be 5th or so "
2190,Chelsea,Not sure how useful this stat is but yeah sure 
2191,Chelsea,Guess he’s taking revenge on us then 
2192,Chelsea,I dont feel like this stat works in the slightest. If Liverpool didn't have Salah then someone else would have been playing and they would have still secured some of the points they have done. There's no telling for example that Chelsea definitely win if Salah didn't play in the game vs us. Without him Liverpool might have played it differently tacticswise and still secured a draw or still won. 
2193,Chelsea,"Without Cold Palmer, chelsea would be in the championship right now. "
2194,Chelsea,"If you took away 17g/a a team would be in worst shape.    
Color. Me. Surprised.    
  
What type of insanity "
2195,Chelsea,"Hahahka this sub never fails to make me laugh, cus without him evrything  would have played out in a way where nobody else would have scored ever and they woiold have lost evry game, sure, the coping in this sub about these billion dollar bottle jobs is insane What are you taking shots at the sub for? Pretty much every response is this thread is talking about how stupid this is."
2196,Chelsea,Now take out Palmer's point contribution and we're last. Cheers 
2197,Chelsea,Probs shouldn’t have let him go 
2198,Chelsea,Where’s that guy who said Liverpool wouldn’t drop off when salah and vvd leave? 
2199,Chelsea,We are one high ankle sprain away from the title is all I’m hearing 
2200,Chelsea,"I think it was originally supposed to be about how good Salah is with his contact talks right now. Didn't need to add Chelsea to it. I think this also meant that Salah was a former Chelsea player who we let go. 

Damn De Bruyne, Lukaku (before becoming a bellend) Salah plus a prime Hazard. Damn we could have dominated English football for the next decade. 

Mourinho really screwed the pooch with his man management skills regarding dealing with the new generation of players."
2201,Chelsea,"It's almost as if Salah wasn't there, they could play another attacker in his place! Yeah I've already been assured by liverpool fans that salah leaving would be no big deal as they have gakpo."
2202,Chelsea,"Yeah, but people take this as it means something "
2203,Chelsea,Right behind Liverpool in 14th. 
2204,Chelsea,Well we finished 12th the season before he arrived so.. 
2205,Chelsea,"OK, so it isn't just me. A stat for stat's sake. Wait! You are also a stat for stat's sake?

![gif](giphy|Wgb2FpSXxhXLVYNnUr|downsized)"
2206,Chelsea,"How is it?

It shows how much they will potentially struggle next season without him. There were similar posts last season about how Chelsea would be near relegation without Cole Palmer. 

But it’s a disingenuous take. Are we going to assume another PK taker like Nico or Noni would miss all 9 PKs that Palmer scored? Or that nobody would step up in Palmer’s absence? Chelsea probably would be mid table but definitely not relegation zone without Palmer last season. Because when a player leaves a club you don’t play with 10 men.

Everyone knows Salah is an all-time great. Someone else will play there, it's not like they'll be fielding 10 once he leaves"
2207,Chelsea,What? This is a good stat that shows how crucial is Salah to Liverpool 
2208,Chelsea,"Your inability to glean the very obvious insight the stat is suggesting says more about you than the utility of the stat It shows obviously Salah is important, which is obvious to anyone watching the sport over the past decade. But it's the same kind of stat that showed we were going to get relegated last season without Palmer, which assumed whoever we played instead of Palmer would have 0 g/a over 30+ games, which is stupid. If Luis Diaz, Darwin, or Gakpo replaced him each game, they would not be in 13th place What relevance does it have to Chelsea? If we had 3 more points and Liverpool were shit then we’d be top of the table. Crazy insight. They'd be nowhere near 13th, this stat assumes they'd be down to 10 without him every game. It obviously shows he's important, but someone else might have contributed just as much in his place, or even more, there's just no way to say

At worst, they'd be 4th-5th, the whole team has been playing well"
2209,Chelsea,He scored against us? Oops oh yeah
2210,Chelsea,What are you taking shots at the sub for? Pretty much every response is this thread is talking about how stupid this is. 
2211,Chelsea,"I think this also meant that Salah was a former Chelsea player who we let go. 

Damn De Bruyne, Lukaku (before becoming a bellend) Salah plus a prime Hazard. Damn we could have dominated English football for the next decade. 

Mourinho really screwed the pooch with his man management skills regarding dealing with the new generation of players. Mourinho didn't screw anything. KDB + Salah couldn't break into the squad at the time and left to get consistent playing time elsewhere. I'd say both did was right at their current situations Sturridge ended up with big injury problems but when we sold him he was our top scorer while playing out of position and we sold him to Liverpool way too cheap at the time. We'd have had at least a couple of incredible seasons from him if he were given a fair chance. The talent was so blatant and he showed it for a few seasons at Liverpool at least. People really only talk about Salah and De Bruyne but Sturridge was the next biggest mistake imo.

Also with regards to Jose and Salah. Jose said that he had wanted to keep Salah but felt he needed a loan to Serie A to get stronger. The sale of Salah was taken out of his hands by the club."
2212,Chelsea,Yeah I've already been assured by liverpool fans that salah leaving would be no big deal as they have gakpo. The football equivalent of 'we have McDonalds at home'
2213,Chelsea,"Wait! You are also a stat for stat's sake?

![gif](giphy|Wgb2FpSXxhXLVYNnUr|downsized) Haha. I read the post after a long night. To me, when I read it, it was a case of a world-class, almost out of contract player having a great start to the season."

Salah is always saving liverpool.

Liverpool are in some problems at the moment. They have 4 world class players, as in players that are established and would start for almost any team and those are allisson, TAA, VVD and salah. Allisson is getting old and their replacement for him is unlikely to reach the same levels. The other 3 are all out of contract this summer and can talk to other clubs from january. Whatever happens they cannot get like for like replacements for these players so you'd expect the team to decline. Tbf that’s two seperate things isn’t it?

Not many opportunities for players on the periphery to gain minutes, confidence, and stake a claim KDB was great in the very limited time that he did feature, and that was after spending a year on loan destroying the Bundesliga.

Salah didn't get infinite opportunities, but he played more and looked completely out of his depth at the time, and that was against minnows.

The two are not comparable, KDB was already ready to play Prem football at the time, while Salah developed a bit later. Plenty of fans didn't want KDB sold but pretty much everyone was ok with Salah leaving because he was a meme back then."

He's never had to do it, prior to this run the most he'd lost in a row was 3. That's hardly a rut! This is insane, I fucking love it but I'm also weirdly glued to see what the fuck Pep does.

2250,Chelsea,"Ill be honest, ive been shittalking him since day 1, and im a little ashamed to say also posted negative comments.
But recently his performances have been good and he definitely is trying to fit in, yes he's still got bagage but it can only be positive, no?  I hope he has a great xmas and bring on the next couple of fixtures! 💙 I’ve always been on the fence that there’s a good player there he just isn’t suited to us, but fair play he’s finding a way to work in our system now When did this ""recently"" apart from last match actually start? Or are you including a conference league match against a club that wouldn't even play in League 2 in the UK?"

I just feel he's improved quite a bit in a small space of time your right about the quality of opponent he's played recently but it can only be a positive, it adds a few pounds back to his value prolly a 40-50mil player, he's an asset after all. He's trying hard to fit in, which can only read as he actually wants to be there.
I remember learning Welsh when i moved from England in my teens and it was so daunting to speak publicly/not that im anyone but i just mean openly other than friends not in front of a camera to millions of people, so his recent interview he done in english, wasnt the best but he had the humilty to try.

2263,Chelsea,"Despite the side struggling in recent matches, Andrey has continued to do well - and was rewarded with his first armband.

Rosenior describes him as doing well in his captain's debut. Not bubbling over with praise, but certainly happy with it:

“He was great,"" Rosenior told GFFN after the match. ""He constantly shows professionalism every day in his work, he constantly wants to improve and constantly trains at 100 per cent.

>""There were other players that had a worthy cause to be captain but I felt that Andrey was the right choice. I felt that he didn’t do the armband any disservice at all.” Giving a loan player the captains arm band feels weird but I guess this is his second year there"
2264,Chelsea,"Yeah Andrey is definitely worthy of the armband in that Strasbourg side 


They're going to have to make big preparations for next season without him, he's unbelievable Question is, who do we send there when he comes back?"
2265,Chelsea,"Enzo, caicedo, tosin, cucurella (according to marescas words), James and now santos 

People have moaned about a lack of leaders for years. I think we’ve done well to buy young players who are also potential leaders; it’s usually a rarity Lavia also apparently earmarked as a character that has a fantastic character and could one day be a leader 

Also Colwill has had the same said about him Recruitment definitely has something to do with it, but we've also just created an environment with a bit of a power vacuum in terms of leadership. Signing all these young hungry players, and challenge them to step up and be leaders is probably pretty powerful. There's almost no one left with historical dressing room power.

There's not really an established power system in place, social or otherwise 'institutional', so these young players can probably sense an opportunity to have an impact. Bet some of them are looking around the room and thinking they can throw their name in the hat for good measure. Maresca is encouraging it as well. He's also mentioned Levi as a future leader. And Cesare has captained U21s.

I remember when we got Enzo, it felt like the 3 prized mids at that moment were him, Rice and Jude, only the latter 2 as surefire leaders. We bemoaned the fact that we didn't have one of those guys to step up and fill the leadership gap (outbound Thiago aside), but I always thought that it wouldn't be too long before the kids we had stepped up. Don't forget colwill either, he'd be my pick for future captain. Add Viega to that list. Colwill is the one for me After his racist video Enzo should’ve never been made captain.  Sorry, Enzo? He's getting back to his game, but every game I've seen him captain us, refs don't even look at him. Dont think he has that type of field presence.

Plus, after the whole racist chant thing, I'd rather not James? You’re talking about Lauren James right? Please say yes."
2266,Chelsea,"When’s he arrives here I just want to make sure we have a kit with a proper collar so he can still pop it. 

He looks like a baller that way "
2267,Chelsea,"Can’t wait until he’s with us next year. This project is so exciting man, so much talent in this club and so young. Still think we need a few more older players personally but I’m riding with the boards decisions "
2268,Chelsea,Needed another Carioca to carry Thiago Silva’s legacy. 
2269,Chelsea,"Get santos back here. Casedei ugochukwu and carney to be sold/ loaned next season. Midfield options of caicedo, enzo, Lavia, santos is absolutely elite "
2270,Chelsea,"A luxury problem is how do we manage Caicedo, Lavia, Andrey and Enzo together?

All 4 of them are top class We will need all of them especially if we have champions league football Modric Casemeiro Kroos Valverde seemed to work decently for Madrid. We will be competing in 4/5 competitions plus Lavia is injury prone. There will be plenty of minutes to go around."
2271,Chelsea,"Estevao and Andrey in Chelsea blue next SZN 

We been patiently waiting. Soon my brothers. "
2272,Chelsea,I know it’s very unlikely but I hope to see Andrey and Casedei team up in the midfield for us consistently one day I think they sell casadei. I had such high hopes for casedei. Hopefully he comes to a decent player somewhere
2273,Chelsea,"It's nice to have some great young brazilian talent joining the club, him and estevao look to be future stars. "
2274,Chelsea,Strasbourg throw away leads every game and it’s genuinely the most enraging thing ever 
2275,Chelsea,He captained Brazil's under 20 team. So he definitely has leadership qualities. 
2276,Chelsea,"I'm sure he can play a role for us when he comes back next summer, excited to see how he develops "
2277,Chelsea,"I wanted him to stay from last season, but I’m sure the bosses up to know what they are doing "
2278,Chelsea,Giving a loan player the captains arm band feels weird but I guess this is his second year there Reece captained Wigan in his last game for them at 18 tbf. Although it’s a big different giving it to a loan player at the start of the season I guess.
2279,Chelsea,"Question is, who do we send there when he comes back?

I don’t think he’ll have the same role as Andrey though, but he’s one of our Strasbourg loans, that’s for sure If they can get away with Moreira as a FB and recently LM, then I think Paez can function centrally for them too."
2307,Chelsea,"Definitely 

Casadei has also captained for Italy when he's played for them in his youth career I doubt Casadei is here long-term though"
2308,Chelsea,"If not, perhaps he could borrow Jean Beliveau's jeans, or Dickie Noles' dickies. Perhaps not Dickie’s - apparently he’s a bit of a dick."
2309,Chelsea,"Exactly, usually by example of good sportsmanship and talent then reece definitely should not be captain."
2310,Chelsea,"Yeah, great reply with no counter argument and just trying to insult. I'd say that's more on par with the average reddit user. “Refs don’t even look at him” is a statement that disqualifies you from having serious conversations"
2311,Chelsea,"Have you watched Paez yet? Because at this point he has zero defensive work rate. Just walks around when his team doesn’t have the ball. Paez most definitely knows how to track back lmaoo, actually brilliant in that regard"

2316,Chelsea,"then reece definitely should not be captain. I agree, as soon as any of these guys shows they are captain material they should be given a shot. Caicedo is proving to be a good prospect for this.


As much as I like Reece, he needs to play regularly and stop being a hothead"
2317,Chelsea,“Refs don’t even look at him” is a statement that disqualifies you from having serious conversations Lmao have a good day

2320,Chelsea,Lmao have a good day 
2321,Chelsea,That is 100% just not true lol I watched him a lot beginning of the year/last year (not so much recently) and he was constantly tracking back for his team and helping defensively. Maybe hes become more lazy now (his g/a has decreased as well)
2322,Chelsea,I watched him a lot beginning of the year/last year (not so much recently) and he was constantly tracking back for his team and helping defensively. Maybe hes become more lazy now (his g/a has decreased as well) That’s fair. He’s been so bad when he doesn’t have the ball that the hype around him has fallen off dramatically. Still think he has a lot of talent but he seems to be trending more towards a guy we loan out a few times and never see play for Chelsea. I hope he sorts it out because his shot is absolutely fucking bananas.
2323,Chelsea,That’s fair. He’s been so bad when he doesn’t have the ball that the hype around him has fallen off dramatically.

2324,Chelsea,"Insane consistency from this young men.

He is only 20 years old.
He plays like a very experience guy calm on the ball.

And also very physical profile too he is winning 8.5 duels per game.
He is also winning 1.7 aerial duels with 72% winning rate.

There is no reason for him to come here next season and challenging for a midfield spot.
He is also a box crasher too which Maresca is asking from Enzo to do.

Don't think we will need to sign lots of players next season. A #1 and a big man striker to back up Jackson and were squared away Another good CB that can challenge Fofana and Colwill, and another striker (samu please I beg) and we are golden"
2325,Chelsea,Ugochukwu is having a similar time at Southampton as what Santos had at Nottingham Forest. Might have to send him back to France in January. He will be sold
2326,Chelsea,He also just captained them. Insane for such a young loan player I was just about to bring this up. At 20 years old. That’s just absurd
2327,Chelsea,"Mans got a great potential.That stupid Steve Cooper wasted his 6 months at forest.

  Would like to see him next to caicedo next season. It honestly annoys me every time I see either of them to think that he just had his sitting on the bench for a season."
2328,Chelsea,"Keep an eye on Sebastian Nanasi. If he has a good second half of the season he can definitely get a spot in the premier league. Nanasi means Pineapple in my native language 😅 Not super familiar with him, can you say more?"
2329,Chelsea,"Andrey Santos' return next season and Estevao's addition will strengthen the squad greatly. We just need to focus all the resources on sorting the GK in the summer. And a striker, only IF Nkunku is gone.

Also need to sort of proper loans for Anselmino, Ugochukwu, and Paez. I think Anselmino can come straight in tbh. Could see us moving on from one or both of Disasi/Badiashile to make room."
2330,Chelsea,"Him and Estevao are gonna be big additions to the squad.

And please halt the ‘they’re not gonna transition easily to the pl’

Madueke managed to and he came from the eredevise where he was slightly above average at best. Audrey should integrate quickly, he's had plenty of time at Chelsea and Europe.

Estevao has huge talent but don't count out the time needed for a kid to integrate into a new club/league/country/culture. I'm sure he'll get plenty of minutes but let's not expect him to be more than a squad player next season. 

Madueke was inconsistent last season so if it was difficult for Madueke who had more experience, then we should expect the same for Estevao"
2331,Chelsea,His last game was nice 
2332,Chelsea,Alright you guys convinced me. All aboard Santos train! 
2333,Chelsea,Santos is gonna make Marescaball click next year 
2334,Chelsea,"He’s built for the role enzo played at the weekend. Seems inevitable him and Caicedo becomes the long term partnership, they’ve got absolutely everything "
2335,Chelsea,My guy!!! Santos kid is doing the things! 
2336,Chelsea,Should've stayed and I bet he would be starting 
2337,Chelsea,For half the money we paid for him. 
2338,Chelsea,I've never really known the what 'Balls Recovered' is and how it's different from tackles and interceptions. 
2339,Chelsea,"I would like to see him alongside moi next season, in rotation with romeo/enzo (one of which we should sell) "
2340,Chelsea,Solid but I’ll never trust League 1 hype French league historically transfers well to the prem. Sure it cannot be compared to the prem however the kid is only 20 so if he's lighting up ligue 1 then you'd expect him to at least perform well in the prem even if not quite to the same level.
2341,Chelsea,"A #1 and a big man striker to back up Jackson and were squared away Indeed, with estevao arriving too we will be set if we get another GK and striker. Hermansen and Delap We just bought Jorgensen I need to see him more before I say we need a new no 1.
But one thing is sure that Sanchez shouldn't be our number 1.

As for backup CF yes we 100% need a new CF.
Also I am expecting Nkunku to leave next season too.

Apart from that I don't think we need any new additions we just have to go like for like if we sell someone which we are not expecting atm."
2342,Chelsea,"Another good CB that can challenge Fofana and Colwill, and another striker (samu please I beg) and we are golden So bin nkunku? Otherwise what are we doing with 3 strikers?"
2343,Chelsea,He will be sold 
2344,Chelsea,I was just about to bring this up. At 20 years old. That’s just absurd They are basically a youth team though and he's likely 1 of the more experienced players strangely enough.
2345,Chelsea,It honestly annoys me every time I see either of them to think that he just had his sitting on the bench for a season.

2364,Chelsea,Yup 
2365,Chelsea,Joe shields magic 
2366,Chelsea,So move Palmer out of his best position? Idk if you’ve realized but we’ve already been doing that for Gusto and Felix.
2367,Chelsea,"Guess what, Chelsea has another 20-yo player who captained his team while being on loan before. And that man is our current captain lol "
2368,Chelsea,Idk if you’ve realized but we’ve already been doing that for Gusto and Felix. 
2369,Chelsea,"The one thing I'm glad about is we are getting better, we were far better last season with Poch than 2022/2023 season, now with Maresca we are playing better than 2023/2024 season and it's something that gives me hope. I can really see us finishing in top 4 this year and it's not a delusion, it's something that realistically could happen. 

When it comes to tactics, I just hope the manager finds out a way to use Nkunku more often, it's a waste to have him on the bench he's an amazing player in my opinion. If we're above ""title challengers"" Arsenal at the end of the season, I will be absolutely insufferable Exactly he is a clutch player I'd say he should be bringing him on on the 60th minute if We can't find a way to score I'm pretty sure he will get a goal atleast like he did vs bournemouth 100% agree. And not to put alot on one player but Caicedo has been our silent knight (our Kante regen haha). When he started to cook closer to the end of last season - the team improved incredibly well.

The role of the modern DM is important - look at City eating grass because of Rodri not being there. It is the building blocks of any succesful project. Both him and ofc palmer got us through dark times.

I love Nkunku but sadly he just doesn't seem as hungry, his style to me seems lazier, like the brother who was promised everything and around the dinner table harbours a level of resentment.

Unlike jackson, the youngest sibling running around with belief & energy in his bones and something to prove. He is not the same player from RB Leibzig and may never be - injuries change players and I hate to say it but him leaving wouldn't end me. Nkunku will be gone in the summer, he doesn't fit anywhere in the team and I've not been impressed by his work rate at all. For comparison felix has just as many non penalty goals and assists per game and works much harder.

What we need is another proper 9 to bring off the bench, duran/samu would have been perfect but that ship seems to have sailed so perhaps we'll go for delap. Obviously it's a small sample size, but we are 3rd around a third of the way through the season, having already played every top 6 team aside from Spurs

It's not crazy to think we have a shot at finishing in the Top 4, though it obviously won't be easy. In a way, our somewhat bloated squad is helping us big time, allowing for several starters to rest every other game more or less

Our ""bloat"" this year consists of genuinely quality players, unlike in years past. I've rarely seen our bench look as strong as it currently does"
2370,Chelsea,"Don't mind the tactics, I think there's a lot to be said for the detailed approach we've gone into games with this season.

Do want us to keep developing a winning mentality. Players who set high standards and are determined to impose themselves on the opposition week in week out. Good signs so far but still periods where we throttle back True. But this team is only 19 games old haha. With time the development & mentality will come, 3rd on the log right now already was on no ones mind and yet here we are - demanding more out of our boys.

They already believe otherwise we would not be here. And this is important. The hunger should not die and I believe we should possibly make 2 more signings to really set us up (GK and CB). Atp don't even care about Gyokers or Osi - we have enough firepower I believe. It is refreshing to see that we at least seem to have a clear approach for each opponent, whether it ends up working out or not. I can't remember too many moments when we've looked genuinely outclassed, even when we've lost we've at least put up a proper challenge, aside from Newcastle in the Cup I guess"
2371,Chelsea,"Cucurella could surely play the Colwill position as the LCB in this set up?

Means having Gusto providing the width instead of Madueke. I’d get behind this. Feels like Gusto provides a lot more threat from out wide. Gusto also hasn’t been too much of a goal threat from the middle - arsenal header miss comes to mind, his finish against city last season is another example. I thought Badi played LCB and Colwill was CCB I’d have to disagree, that would mean playing madueke or Neto on the inside, and having sancho or mudryk hold width. I’d rather have Felix/nkunku inside and Neto/madueke hold width than madueke/neto inside and sancho/mudryk hold width, having gusto in isn’t worth it, 

cucurella has good enough end product as gusto, we saw this for the goal Enzo scored , came from a cross from cucu Yep. Cucu-Colwill-fofana"
2372,Chelsea,">Against Villa I'd like to see the same setup except have Neto start over Noni

Ya what you said here is exactly the thought I was having after the game. Absolutely would love to see that, Neto is more experienced and more talented to play that role than Noni Yes! And the fact that he and Felix have that connection, I would love to see what this could end up looking like. disagree ngl, I think trying to play a 3-1-6 against Villa we will get run ragged in the midfield, I think we have to bring Lavia back for that game, and play a 3-2-5, only thing I’m scared of is fofana defending against wingers."
2373,Chelsea,"Against the right opposition I agree, the tactical flexibility is a breath of fresh air. Especially when you consider the rigidity of some of our tactics over the last few years. 

To me though it still feels that barring CP and probably Enzo to a slightly lesser extent, we are lacking players with the keys to unlock the low block that teams fall into. 

So despite the tactics allowing us more attacking options going forward, the personnel can sometimes limit the productivity of those options. Neto and Sancho can solve low blocks. Dynamic wingers"
2374,Chelsea,"Yes one of the things I’ve been impressed with is his ability to be adaptable.  He’s not afraid to tweak it game by game and also make bold substitutions if required.  This is something Leicester fans said he would not do.

I was really not enthusiastic about his appointment but he’s really impressed me.  The players also seem to like him and have bought into his approach. Think it shows how differently he saw the two squads and the needs of the two leagues. Pretty fascinating, tbh."
2375,Chelsea,"Can't make up my mind between wanting Cole to score all the goals and wanting the rest of the team to excel, but it's the best issue I've had watching this team in 4 years. I'm so excited "
2376,Chelsea,"I really want to like Felix but can’t help but feel he plays for himself. Guy will shoot from any position and is prone to a rash challenge. 

Hope he proves me wrong I'm on the side of really like him as a personality (*) but just can't seem to get on board with him as a player.

*Hard not to like someone who was desperate to stay despite joining in our worst period of the modern era, compare that to a certain two of his fellow attackers from that year who couldn't wait to ditch us at the first sign of trouble. If Félix had Lampard’s footballing IQ he would be world class. Thoroughly disagree. He's a creative player, and sure his flair can give the impression that he doesn't care, but that's not at all how I see it. He's tasked with trying to create goals, be it the risky Hollywood pass or the shot from distance from time to time. I actually think he strikes a great balance between finding runners in space and trying his luck himself. We already have two wingers in Madueke, who will only shoot, and Sancho, who will only create. A mix is fine.

His defensive work is really underrated, and i think many are starting to realize. Him being 'prone to a rash challenge' just doesn't seem an issue, and I don't really agree that he is. I know the first impression every Chelsea fan has of him is the sending off vs Fulham. But that is also his *only* straight red in his entire career, even as far back in youth football as I can find stats for.

Felix has things to improve on no doubt, but I firmly believe he's been stereotyped as a flair luxury player for so long because of his good technical level, and his 'devil may care' looks/demeanor, that people typecast him as such and overlook the other things he does. The guy we had last time had the weight of the club on his shoulders, because no one - *no one* - could score, so he was selfish  in feeling like it was his mission to break through.

Thus far for us, I think he feels like he has so, so much to prove, and he's also got to fight for playing time, e.g. be better than a certain 1-3 players, in order to push them aside.

But re-watch the last match and you'll see that he actually played a full, 2-way match for the first time. It felt like he was locked in the whole time, not just when he had the ball - and you have to think that Maresca is getting through to him.

It's just one match, but it's a positive sign. Yes but he is playing like that right now I believe because he does not have a guaranteed position and tends to ""do too much"". With time, confidence and composure will come.

I mean it was so easy for him to break the lines with runs/dribbles - in a way only he could do. And he is hungry to track back and defend - the passion is there. If we going to have patience with our other players, the same should be extended to Felix. Felix should just play striker, competing with Jackson. While Nkunku should be in midfield where he can use his creativity and passing more. 


Felix can play selfishly, Nkunku can create more..it's already worked before in the Conference league. All flash and no end product. There’s a reason why it hasn’t worked out for him at any club. His career will pan out similar to Ross Barkley albeit he is a better player Felix was excellent off ball vs Foxes. Huge credit to him. He knows if he doesn't work hard he won't play. Both Felix and nkunku need to understand this if they want minutes."
2377,Chelsea,An area for improvement : given Felix starts as a winger but tucks in as a left 10 which leaves the left flank empty; (might be unpopular) Chilwell is clearly is a better fit than Cucurella for a more traditional LB role with lots of attacking and overlapping duties since he offers more on the ball from those positions. But that would only be possible against specific types of opposition as it would impact our defensive balance and leave the midfield physically lacking. 
2378,Chelsea,The Maresca stubborn/tactically inflexible narrative was very odd going into this season and wasn’t instantly dispelled. 
2379,Chelsea,"What I really like is that he is not afraid to park the bus when needed, sure we have less thrilling games compared to last season, but this team is now more mature, have played more together and are more comfortable with each other, and we are getting more points in the board and that is what really matters. "
2380,Chelsea,"Yes, I loved this setup. Especially Felix + Palmer, but also Cucu going down wing.

Agreed — best thing is seeing Maresca play with different approaches for different needs.

We have a wealth of talent. Unfortunately, some top players will always be left out. But using different systems helps to get different players time.

  
I'd love to see this again, including against Villa, but sure he'll change it up for them. Curious to see what he comes up with. And hope everyone is clicking better then. "
2381,Chelsea,"I’ve been worried about the inverting tactic since the hire was announced because it doesn’t really fit out squad’s strengths at all, and I was also worried about his alleged inflexibility but that concern was dispelled in preseason when every game was slightly different. Now, I look forward to the lineup sheets and the start of each game because I’m curious how we’ll setup each time. 

Unfortunately, I’m not holding my breath that this setup against the Foxes will be some sort of new normal, because in his pressers Maresca is very clear that he doesn’t think it’s defensively solid enough, and I share those concerns. Think it depends on the matchup. "
2382,Chelsea,"Great analysis, OP - enjoyed everything except the observations on Badi. He had a decent game, sure - but he’s not ready to be a regular starter against strong opposition, IMHO. "
2383,Chelsea,"Strongly disagree 

That setup left a gaping hole in midfield with caicedo in it 

Worked because Leicester are trash but won’t work against good teams 

The 4-2-3-1 is still our best setup just drop Noni and No 8 for Lavia and Neto and we’ll be fine If it works against Leicester, then that's fine because we were playing Leicester. 

Being adaptable means he won't do that against a team that can punish that. Yeah, the midfield was easily cut through about 5 or 6 times. I mean if we are playing harder teams the only thing we really have to change is either have Enzo drop and stay in a 3-2-5 instead of a 3-1-6, only issue is Colwill can’t play lcb he doesn’t have the pace for it, so we would have to stick with badiashile Colwill pairing, I think that’s what’s been preventing maresca from trying it for a while , then the injury of both gusto and rj gave him an opportunity to try it ."
2384,Chelsea,"Shame he/the club have decided Chilwell will not be played. I think he would do a better job than Cucurella does in that role when we play that way. Cucu miles better atm I think you'd be better on Reddit if you stopped smoking crack. In November 2024 idts this is a surprising take. i like Chilwell, but Cucu has been great the last few games. one of the last places i'd look to improve our squad. Honestly not sure I agree, chilwell is a relic from a forgotten time. We played him in the CL and he seemed to struggle abit, think the lack of game time has aged him even more. 

Cucu is an exceptional talent and when he plays I feel confident."
2385,Chelsea,"Being stubborn is the least of the worries. The real issue is that he's a puppet.

He was completely waffling last summer. He said Sterling does not fit his system, then plays KDH at right wing. He said Chilwell does not fit his system, only to overlap Cucurella as we saw against Leicester. He said he had a plan for EnzoF, only to play him the exact same way Pochettino played him. Even plays Fofana, Badiashille and Disasi as fullbacks, which is what Poch haters were moaning about for months when it happened to Colwill.

He is doing as told. His decisions are purely financial based. Felix over Nkunku makes it obvious by now.

Once we regress into the norm within the reality that you can't win on the pitch because of successful OPEX cutting operations, then there will be problems. most delusional comment I've seen on this subreddit all season  Maybe he is (gasp) working with what he has and man managing properly enough to make the team better? >Even plays Fofana, Badiashille and Disasi as fullbacks, which is what Poch haters were moaning about for months when it happened to Colwill.

Difference is, Poch was using Colwill as a literal fullback hugging the touchline while Maresca is using a back three in possession.

Can't even believe this obvious difference needs to be pointed out.

>Felix over Nkunku makes it obvious by now.

Please expand further. Never trust a man with a Gallagher flair… I don't mean this to be disrespectful. I might fight in other threads but our blood is both blue haha.

I think you are looking on the wrong side of things, the fact that he has been ""modular"" and ""flexible"" enough to have strong opinions and adapt them is exactly the kind of manager I want. Not like POCHball who kept playing Colwill LB or have any tactical expirments and keep the same squad for 90"" despite the setup not working. No game management etc. All he did was hoof ball up field and run. Or when we get into opponents final 3rd we pass back and have our CBS have 300 total passes in a game lol

Maresca has made so many changes which shows he has a tactical base and trying to play to each players strenghts. He played RJ LB to expirment if Enzo was needed in that 8 role and Gusto run up into an 8/10 - box to box kind of role.

To run all these tests in the short amount of time and not have our team fall apart like cheese - you have to have incredible tactical depth - which he has shown clearly. Miles above poch IMO. Utter woke nonsense"
2386,Chelsea,"If we're above ""title challengers"" Arsenal at the end of the season, I will be absolutely insufferable ![gif](giphy|29HRejgahYenVsohB5)

I have so many Arsenal friends I can't wait to rub it in - I am counting the micro seconds. Odegaard is carrying them so hard Live in the moment and be insufferable now"
2387,Chelsea,Exactly he is a clutch player I'd say he should be bringing him on on the 60th minute if We can't find a way to score I'm pretty sure he will get a goal atleast like he did vs bournemouth

He is not the same player from RB Leibzig and may never be - injuries change players and I hate to say it but him leaving wouldn't end me. Yeah, can definitely be argued Caicedo has been our most important player this season. Doesn't get enough credit, but he's absolutely critical.

Edit: And I agree — good note on how his shift in form was central to the team's shift in form end of last season. When Caicedo got subbed against Leicester, that's when we began to lose control. That's how important this player is. Caicedo isn't a DM. He never was. He is wasted there. Kante was never a DM. They are just black and athletic. Kante played ahead of Drinkwater at Leicester."

They already believe otherwise we would not be here. And this is important. The hunger should not die and I believe we should possibly make 2 more signings to really set us up (GK and CB). Atp don't even care about Gyokers or Osi - we have enough firepower I believe. Absolutely. I just think Maresca has his finger on the button tactically and coachingwise and it's now just about whether he can build the right identity. You mean its not like EAFC where the team chemistry improves faster than my retirement fund in 5 weeks or less?"
2392,Chelsea,"It is refreshing to see that we at least seem to have a clear approach for each opponent, whether it ends up working out or not. I can't remember too many moments when we've looked genuinely outclassed, even when we've lost we've at least put up a proper challenge, aside from Newcastle in the Cup I guess "
2393,Chelsea,"I’d get behind this. Feels like Gusto provides a lot more threat from out wide. Gusto also hasn’t been too much of a goal threat from the middle - arsenal header miss comes to mind, his finish against city last season is another example.  Compared to Cucurella I would agree. Seems Maresca hasn’t ever wanted a true wide winger on the right though. Madueke has been key because he can dribble defenders either inside or out - Gusto cannot do this"
2394,Chelsea,"I thought Badi played LCB and Colwill was CCB Yeah, that’s right… so I guess I mean Cucurella can play the Badi role then"
2395,Chelsea,"I’d have to disagree, that would mean playing madueke or Neto on the inside, and having sancho or mudryk hold width. I’d rather have Felix/nkunku inside and Neto/madueke hold width than madueke/neto inside and sancho/mudryk hold width, having gusto in isn’t worth it, 

cucurella has good enough end product as gusto, we saw this for the goal Enzo scored , came from a cross from cucu Yea it’s much more about the winger options than Gusto/Cucu and outside of Palmer our CAMs prefer that left space unlike Cole. That's not not true lol. 

Neto would be the LW and hold the width on the left while Gusto held the width on the right. It would be the inverted version of what we saw Vs Leicester"
2396,Chelsea,Yep. Cucu-Colwill-fofana 
2397,Chelsea,"Yes! And the fact that he and Felix have that connection, I would love to see what this could end up looking like. "
2398,Chelsea,"disagree ngl, I think trying to play a 3-1-6 against Villa we will get run ragged in the midfield, I think we have to bring Lavia back for that game, and play a 3-2-5, only thing I’m scared of is fofana defending against wingers. Fofana has been an absolute unit in the last few games. The one defender that should be worried about in Colwill, the dude has been very erratic and immature and I'm scared for him"
2399,Chelsea,Neto and Sancho can solve low blocks. Dynamic wingers 
2400,Chelsea,"Think it shows how differently he saw the two squads and the needs of the two leagues. Pretty fascinating, tbh. "
2401,Chelsea,"I'm on the side of really like him as a personality (*) but just can't seem to get on board with him as a player.

*Hard not to like someone who was desperate to stay despite joining in our worst period of the modern era, compare that to a certain two of his fellow attackers from that year who couldn't wait to ditch us at the first sign of trouble. Harsh take mate. He has not been here as long as other players. With frequent game time he will come good and if he does not step up, Nkunku can play in that role too. 

11 games 6 G/A from Felix and only 1 PL start. Yes his finishing has been poor at times and yes he makes rash decisions - outside palmer and only now recently Jackson - who of our players haven't fallen into this. Trust he will come good."
2402,Chelsea,If Félix had Lampard’s footballing IQ he would be world class. 
2403,Chelsea,"Thoroughly disagree. He's a creative player, and sure his flair can give the impression that he doesn't care, but that's not at all how I see it. He's tasked with trying to create goals, be it the risky Hollywood pass or the shot from distance from time to time. I actually think he strikes a great balance between finding runners in space and trying his luck himself. We already have two wingers in Madueke, who will only shoot, and Sancho, who will only create. A mix is fine.

His defensive work is really underrated, and i think many are starting to realize. Him being 'prone to a rash challenge' just doesn't seem an issue, and I don't really agree that he is. I know the first impression every Chelsea fan has of him is the sending off vs Fulham. But that is also his *only* straight red in his entire career, even as far back in youth football as I can find stats for.

Felix has things to improve on no doubt, but I firmly believe he's been stereotyped as a flair luxury player for so long because of his good technical level, and his 'devil may care' looks/demeanor, that people typecast him as such and overlook the other things he does. I'm with you.

He also needs time in a system that suits him to gel with teammates. I think what we saw this weekend could be that. He has 1 assist in like 26 games for us. Doesn’t scream creative to me"
2404,Chelsea,"The guy we had last time had the weight of the club on his shoulders, because no one - *no one* - could score, so he was selfish  in feeling like it was his mission to break through.

Thus far for us, I think he feels like he has so, so much to prove, and he's also got to fight for playing time, e.g. be better than a certain 1-3 players, in order to push them aside.

But re-watch the last match and you'll see that he actually played a full, 2-way match for the first time. It felt like he was locked in the whole time, not just when he had the ball - and you have to think that Maresca is getting through to him.

It's just one match, but it's a positive sign. Yup!"
2405,Chelsea,"Yes but he is playing like that right now I believe because he does not have a guaranteed position and tends to ""do too much"". With time, confidence and composure will come.

I mean it was so easy for him to break the lines with runs/dribbles - in a way only he could do. And he is hungry to track back and defend - the passion is there. If we going to have patience with our other players, the same should be extended to Felix. "
2406,Chelsea,"Felix should just play striker, competing with Jackson. While Nkunku should be in midfield where he can use his creativity and passing more. 


Felix can play selfishly, Nkunku can create more..it's already worked before in the Conference league. "
2407,Chelsea,All flash and no end product. There’s a reason why it hasn’t worked out for him at any club. His career will pan out similar to Ross Barkley albeit he is a better player 
2408,Chelsea,Felix was excellent off ball vs Foxes. Huge credit to him. He knows if he doesn't work hard he won't play. Both Felix and nkunku need to understand this if they want minutes. 
2409,Chelsea,"If it works against Leicester, then that's fine because we were playing Leicester. 

Being adaptable means he won't do that against a team that can punish that. I hope so because Maresca’s adaptation didn’t really work against big teams besides Arsenal"
2410,Chelsea,"Yeah, the midfield was easily cut through about 5 or 6 times. "
2411,Chelsea,"I mean if we are playing harder teams the only thing we really have to change is either have Enzo drop and stay in a 3-2-5 instead of a 3-1-6, only issue is Colwill can’t play lcb he doesn’t have the pace for it, so we would have to stick with badiashile Colwill pairing, I think that’s what’s been preventing maresca from trying it for a while , then the injury of both gusto and rj gave him an opportunity to try it . "
2412,Chelsea,Cucu miles better atm Yes.
2413,Chelsea,"I think you'd be better on Reddit if you stopped smoking crack. Because I think Chilwell is a better attacking fullback than Cucurella and since we're paying him £200k p/w we should maybe consider him? 

>better on Reddit

So you just say whatever you think will get upvotes? Pretty pathetic."
2414,Chelsea,In November 2024 idts Would you say the same about Reece James then? When he recovers we shouldn't consider him as it's November 2024.
2415,Chelsea,"this is a surprising take. i like Chilwell, but Cucu has been great the last few games. one of the last places i'd look to improve our squad. "
2416,Chelsea,"Honestly not sure I agree, chilwell is a relic from a forgotten time. We played him in the CL and he seemed to struggle abit, think the lack of game time has aged him even more. 

Cucu is an exceptional talent and when he plays I feel confident. >chilwell is a relic from a forgotten time.

He's 27."
2417,Chelsea,most delusional comment I've seen on this subreddit all season  
2418,Chelsea,Maybe he is (gasp) working with what he has and man managing properly enough to make the team better? 
2419,Chelsea,">Even plays Fofana, Badiashille and Disasi as fullbacks, which is what Poch haters were moaning about for months when it happened to Colwill.

Difference is, Poch was using Colwill as a literal fullback hugging the touchline while Maresca is using a back three in possession.

Can't even believe this obvious difference needs to be pointed out.

>Felix over Nkunku makes it obvious by now.

Please expand further. not OP so I'm just gonna try address the Felix/nkunku part.

I think what he means is that, nkunku is the better player out of the two yet hasn't started since city, where he was out of position. The tactical system against Leicester would've been perfect for Nkunku cause he would've been in the 10 alongside Palmer, but maresca only gave him 10 minutes at the end, which is kinda crazy. And he's barely been getting PL minutes as a sub overall.

and since nkunku isn't part of the current wage structure, can't help but feel like we're slowly showing him the door, which is sad."
2420,Chelsea,Never trust a man with a Gallagher flair… 
2421,Chelsea,"I don't mean this to be disrespectful. I might fight in other threads but our blood is both blue haha.

I think you are looking on the wrong side of things, the fact that he has been ""modular"" and ""flexible"" enough to have strong opinions and adapt them is exactly the kind of manager I want. Not like POCHball who kept playing Colwill LB or have any tactical expirments and keep the same squad for 90"" despite the setup not working. No game management etc. All he did was hoof ball up field and run. Or when we get into opponents final 3rd we pass back and have our CBS have 300 total passes in a game lol

Maresca has made so many changes which shows he has a tactical base and trying to play to each players strenghts. He played RJ LB to expirment if Enzo was needed in that 8 role and Gusto run up into an 8/10 - box to box kind of role.

To run all these tests in the short amount of time and not have our team fall apart like cheese - you have to have incredible tactical depth - which he has shown clearly. Miles above poch IMO. "
2422,Chelsea,Utter woke nonsense

I have so many Arsenal friends I can't wait to rub it in - I am counting the micro seconds. "
2424,Chelsea,Odegaard is carrying them so hard 
2425,Chelsea,Live in the moment and be insufferable now 
2426,Chelsea,"Yeah, can definitely be argued Caicedo has been our most important player this season. Doesn't get enough credit, but he's absolutely critical.

Edit: And I agree — good note on how his shift in form was central to the team's shift in form end of last season. "
2427,Chelsea,"When Caicedo got subbed against Leicester, that's when we began to lose control. That's how important this player is. "
2428,Chelsea,"Caicedo isn't a DM. He never was. He is wasted there. Kante was never a DM. They are just black and athletic. Kante played ahead of Drinkwater at Leicester. Caicedo absolutely is a dm. He played deepest out of all their mids for Brighton and he’s done it here too

World class players can do more than just their core role; as caicedo has shown. That doesn’t mean he is a box to box player although he can play there Mmm I’ll have to disagree, Caicedo is dm, I agree his might be better utilised box2box but but he can also be good as a dm, in possession I think he very good at it, out of possession he could work on his reading of the game.

It’s not the same situation as Kante at all My guy reaching just to throw the word ""black"" around. 

![gif](giphy|8ycyVOXxpmVgRgiYBC)"
2429,Chelsea,Absolutely. I just think Maresca has his finger on the button tactically and coachingwise and it's now just about whether he can build the right identity. 
2430,Chelsea,You mean its not like EAFC where the team chemistry improves faster than my retirement fund in 5 weeks or less? 
2431,Chelsea, Compared to Cucurella I would agree. Seems Maresca hasn’t ever wanted a true wide winger on the right though. Madueke has been key because he can dribble defenders either inside or out - Gusto cannot do this Makes sense. I just feel that gusto is being under utilised through the centre. He was big threat with his overlapping and general running up and down the right wing last season. City away is one such example. He did so much leg work on the wing and squared a great pass to Jackson to score. Kinda miss that contribution from him when he plays through the centre
2432,Chelsea,"Yeah, that’s right… so I guess I mean Cucurella can play the Badi role then Nah, Badi is an aerial threat, better passer on his day than Cucu and stronger physical presence. I love Cucu as an over/under lapping LB but to replace Badi in a back 3 - I couldn't get behind that."
2433,Chelsea,Yea it’s much more about the winger options than Gusto/Cucu and outside of Palmer our CAMs prefer that left space unlike Cole. 
2434,Chelsea,"That's not not true lol. 

Neto would be the LW and hold the width on the left while Gusto held the width on the right. It would be the inverted version of what we saw Vs Leicester Okay but again why would we rather play madueke on the inside than Felix or Nkunku just to fit in gusto?"
2435,Chelsea,"Fofana has been an absolute unit in the last few games.

He just doesn't impact games near enough for how naturally gifted he is."

He also needs time in a system that suits him to gel with teammates. I think what we saw this weekend could be that. "
2438,Chelsea,"He has 1 assist in like 26 games for us. Doesn’t scream creative to me Obviously, but he also played in the worst most dysfunctional Chelsea side in years. Not that he's blameless, but he needs to be deployed with runners around him. Lets see what he can do this season.

There's no doubt in my mind that in time he will show that. If you don't think he's a creative player for what he's shown in his career then I don't know what to tell you. A major chunk of those 26 ganes was with a grumpy Havertz, a grumpy ziyech, an injured & grumpy mount, an old & confused Aubemayang, a shite Sterling, and... Gallagher. 

How many goals did these attackers even score in his period here, then let's talk about his assists.."
2439,Chelsea,Yup! 
2440,Chelsea,"I hope so because Maresca’s adaptation didn’t really work against big teams besides Arsenal Yeah we lost close games to City and Liverpool, I don't think that's particularly relevant to whether he's tactically flexible.

2441,Chelsea,Yes.

I can understand the arguments for being annoyed with Christos lack of game time but for me but the idea he's being ditched purely due to who brought him and when he was brought just doesn't stand upto scrutiny. FIFA ultimate team tactics don't work in reality. 


Jackson is undroppable aswell.

And we don't score many from crosses anyway, creating overloads in the box and running in behind is where most chances come from and a extra 10 helps us to facilitate and create this chaos. I agree, Gusto was brilliant bombing down the right side but as of yet we’ve not tried that set up at all. 

Feel it could work and allow us to play dual 10s again like vs Leicester. Just with Cucurella, Colwill, Fofana making up the back three. 

Maresca has been pretty flexible so we may see it. Madueke seems to be an ever present so far though He looked worlds better last season. But I get it that some people are being sacrificed for the system. We must recall that pass against city differently, it was actually awful and part of the reason Jackson missed. Jackson pass that same game for the assist was a ton better"

He just doesn't impact games near enough for how naturally gifted he is. I hear you - but somewhere in that kid is a baller. And in this short space he has shown flashes of this.

With the right training - just like how maresca was able to improve Mudryk's cheese legs to a player who is able to display some level of football IQ - I think the right mentorship can improve him. But I guess only time will tell. I do wonder if the lack of impact has more come from the situation he's been put in. He was never really trusted at Atletico, was somewhat of a minnow at Barca compared to some of the other names he was playing with and even his first loan spell here he came in at a time to complete chaos. I don't think he's ever had the environment where he's been allowed to take games by the scruff of the neck and win them. I hope he gets some more chances to do that here."

And we don't score many from crosses anyway, creating overloads in the box and running in behind is where most chances come from and a extra 10 helps us to facilitate and create this chaos. This is something I suggested during the pre season and can still be tried more often - Neto LW, Gusto RW (said James at the time) in a 3-2-4-1 attacking phase, providing cut backs. We don’t see a lot of those right now. The wingers can overlap the corresponding attacking midfielder on that side and provide either diagonal cut backs to the other no.10 or play a parallel cross to Nico who’d be bombing the 6 yard box with the other winger occupying the far post area. Another chaotic setup for the opposition defenders to deal with"

-- Badi - Colwill - Fofana -- The one concern I have with this is playing Badiashile as LB. I don’t think he has the 1v1 ability to cope. However, Gusto overlapping would work for better than Cucurella. Are u saying this is a better line up than the one against Leicester? Or are u just saying it’s an option that can be used.

Maybe against weaker opposition, but I don’t trust palmers off ball workrate to play him rw"

And when you think about it, isn’t Putin a victim of this war? I’m sure it’s caused him a lot of stress. 

Honestly the way Roman did this was very intentional and I know he obviously transformed our club but we shouldn’t forget who he is. It's essentially frozen in Romans accounts, and the UK government won't unfreeze them until they're sure what exactly Roman plans to do with it. Absolutely no way will Putin accept one of his closest oligarchs giving billions to Ukraine, so it will probably be sat doing nothing. 

The actual line given was ""victims of the war in Ukraine"" which is a vague enough wording meaning the funds could end up going to the Russian war effort, as victims of the war in Ukraine, rather than to Ukraine."
2478,Chelsea,"The article is all about if the Chelsea strategy doesn’t succeed. Most purchases are going up in value, the exceptions being Mudryk and Enzo who were bought for high prices. Mason and Gallagher were academy players and therefore pure profit. Colwill fits that camp at present and the European Conference League gives others exposure. "
2479,Chelsea,"No front of shirt sponsorship is a massive red flag - what the fuck is going in? What do potential suitors know that we don’t? We know absolutely fuckall I'd imagine they're waiting to sign a deal gambling that after this season, hopefully a strong one with champions league football at the end of it, our shirt becomes more valuable to sponsorship. 

If they sign a deal now with only conference league football and a dodgy couple of seasons, it'll be lower than it could otherwise be long term. Short term loss for long term gain. I think potential suitors aren't willing to pay UCL sponsorship prices for conference league. Would make sense if they're holding out for a big name to pay big fees vs what's been offered. They know how much Chelsea are demanding."

2496,Chelsea,"How much extra would a shirt sponsorship have to be to make up for 2 seasons zero sponsorship We haven't had 2 seasons of zero sponsorship, we're having 1 so far. 

I don't know the exact numbers obviously, but if it's 50 million a year for 5 years 1 year from now, or 35 million a year for 6 years starting now, then that's 40 million more if you wait. It's just this year. We had Infinite Athlete last year on a one year deal at £40m

Right now we are looking for a longer term sponsor in the £60m a year range. Without Champions League football most potential sponsors (and the premier League for fair market value) probably put our shirt sponsor value around £40m (less for short term deals).  So by those numbers if we sign a multi year deal at £40m and then get back to our champions league ways and could have been valued £60m it would have been bad business. If we hold out and either find a low value one year sponsor or no sponsor this year it would only take 2 years at our expected value to be ahead. They are gambling on the team. I would rather they do that and show confidence than just accept anything. iirc the prize money for winning the europa league was less than what we received the following season for advancing through the group stage of the Champions league alone.

Neither of our owners are idiots and doubt they'd leave free money on the table. Best guess is that sponsors don't want a 1 year deal and are trying to get a multi year deal on their side as well. They've probably considered all options. Maybe no one wants to pay enough for a 1 year deal to make it worthwhile. Or they've got some possibilities lined up depending on where we are halfway through the season."

2517,Chelsea,"Honestly, this whole ""Pep regrets selling Palmer"" talk by the media and the fans makes no sense. Every club has let go of players who went on to become some of the best talents in the world, like Mo Salah and De Bruyne at Chelsea, there is no point in trying to make this argument. It's salient when a club is flat, and the maths hint that perhaps one of those lost stars could plug the hole. It's a ""what if"", but the sport is intrinsically filled with them, either way."
2518,Chelsea,"GTP'd Summary:

Pep Guardiola's discussion of Cole Palmer primarily focuses on the circumstances of his departure from Manchester City and how it reflects Guardiola's philosophy regarding player happiness:

- Guardiola emphasizes that a player must be happy to perform at their best. Since Palmer wanted to leave City for Chelsea, Guardiola respected that decision, believing it was necessary for Palmer's growth and satisfaction​
- He acknowledges Palmer's significant talent and potential, noting that the young forward has thrived with more opportunities at Chelsea. Guardiola points out that while Palmer had shown flashes of brilliance at City, the limited game time (just 489 Premier League minutes) might have hindered his development​
- Guardiola maintains that his approach is consistent: if a player, no matter their talent, is unhappy or desires to leave, he prefers to let them go to create a better environment for both the player and the team​

This perspective highlights Guardiola's broader management style, prioritizing harmony within the squad over retaining players who are dissatisfied. "
2519,Chelsea,"I don't know why they didn't just loan him. Palmer has said they told him he either stays or they sell him, when he was up for going on loan.

""My thing was never to leave City. That was not my intention [to leave]. I wanted to go on loan for a year, come back and be ready for the first team but he [Guardiola] said I can't go on loan. You either 'stay or you get sold."" Probably thought £40m was a good price for someone who had played the equivalent of 5 full games. Just because a player has potential it doesn’t mean they are going to achieve it."
2520,Chelsea,"It's salient when a club is flat, and the maths hint that perhaps one of those lost stars could plug the hole. It's a ""what if"", but the sport is intrinsically filled with them, either way. "
2521,Chelsea,"Probably thought £40m was a good price for someone who had played the equivalent of 5 full games. Just because a player has potential it doesn’t mean they are going to achieve it. He didn't just have potential though, he had ability. A month after be left Man City he was one of the best players in the league. Well Palmer's story is that they wanted to him to stay and he wanted to go out on loan. They told him he can either stay as a fringe player or leave on a permanent deal. Apparently Pep didn't want to loan him but bed him in over time (like he did Foden) but Palmer wanted to play. 

It's probably a Pep thing, he wants his young players to train with the team and wait their turn"
2522,Chelsea,"He didn't just have potential though, he had ability. A month after be left Man City he was one of the best players in the league. "

It's probably a Pep thing, he wants his young players to train with the team and wait their turn "
2524,Chelsea,"We will be there to see another Dyer masterclass He has always been a talent, but looks something very special this season. Extremely concerned he is going to force a move away. Need to give hime some ECL minutes ASAP."
2525,Chelsea,"The attack looks amazing. Deivid especially is just having a romp out there. Nice to see Olise playing higher up, too. "
2526,Chelsea,Bettinelli is starting for them! That was a shock to see - he's double their ages! Where is our fleet of teenager keepers?
2527,Chelsea,"He has always been a talent, but looks something very special this season. Extremely concerned he is going to force a move away. Need to give hime some ECL minutes ASAP. Might be in luck bc he isn’t in the u21 squad

But and again, doubt he’ll get a debut away to one of the best ecl teams"
2528,Chelsea,That was a shock to see - he's double their ages! Where is our fleet of teenager keepers? 
2529,Chelsea,"Might be in luck bc he isn’t in the u21 squad

But and again, doubt he’ll get a debut away to one of the best ecl teams "
2530,Chelsea,One point behind City. What a time! Hearing that would've been more exciting if it was any other season 😂 I'm sure we'll overtake them next gameweek We'll be ahead of city by the time they play liverpool on Sunday
2531,Chelsea,Massive test on Sunday man we need to win For some weird reason I think it ll end 0-0 but I hope Im wrong
2532,Chelsea,"Maresca has done wonders with this team so far, if we can gain some wins in the coming weeks against Spurs and Villa we can really help our chances for top 4 with the favourable run of fixtures that follows those games Also seemingly no vicario against us which should be a big boost we are doing well, but not ""wonders"". the best he did is set up a clear gameplan and squad. still some questionable moves. its still early days. Let's not sit here and act like Poch didn't build this team tho"
2533,Chelsea,"Every week there are dropped points to help us out. Lowly WHam was considering sacking their mgr, and they pull out a win against NUFC, who could have been sitting 1pt behind us.

I love it when the table is very nearly sorted by GD (although it's fitting that Spuds are +9 and short on wins). "
2534,Chelsea,Got to take advantage of Villas poor form on Sunday. 
2535,Chelsea,We are gonna sit second after game www 13 
2536,Chelsea,It's great but seeing that 2-10 are basically level this year...  anybody has a chance right now. That smash and grab we did away to Bournemouth is gonna live long in the memory if the table continues to be this tight
2537,Chelsea,"One slip from Liverpool and it’s an open game. Let’s beat Villa and Spurs next, then we can talk about challenging for the title Soton as well. Let's not underestimate anyone."
2538,Chelsea,City plays Liverpool next. We’ve got Villa. C’mon lads! Let’s jump them. 
2539,Chelsea,"It’s not fucking bad is it. 

Hopefully Liverpool and City draw next weekend and we win to start closing the gap on Liverpool. Honestly, with City slumping, Arsenal being a little up and down - there’s no reason why we shouldn’t be talking about winning the league. 

Doesn’t have to be completely realistic but it would be very good for us to finish the season at least in the title conversation! Liverpool are going to absolutely tear through City with the way the latter has been playing recently. And I prefer City to lose, so our odds for top 4 increase. ""Closing the gap on Liverpool""...no.

We ain't winning the league or going to be in the title race. Not with Robert Sanchez in goal.

Let's just focus on getting Champions League football, where we belong first."
2540,Chelsea,"Only 3 points separate 3rd and 8th so take our current position with a grain of salt.  Now is the time to show if Maresca has added some steel to the talent.  We're 1 bad result away from falling behind, but if we continue our form we can seal top 4. "
2541,Chelsea,"Feels good to not be shit anymore. Now we just need to start beating top teams and I’ll be convinced we’re back. If we repeat the same results vs the big 6 in the reverse fixtures but still finish top 4 what would your reaction be? 

I'll be so real I'm not so fussed about the big 6 record THIS season if it still means we finished top 4. After all out only two Ls are vs the top two"
2542,Chelsea,"Please, for the love of all that is holy, don’t let the Bin-Dippers run away with this League. Please, oh please, let them drop some of those 8 points down the gap…! As long as it's not Arsenal I don't care tbh My roommate is a Liverpool fan and it's absolutely horrible I'd rather Liverpool win the league than Arsenal. Feck Arsenal 100x.

And we are not winning this league. I can almost guarantee it. Not with Robert Sanchez in goal. He is going to kill us in future matches. Until that is sorted, forget challenging.

Goals wins you games, defence wins you titles. I would rather Liverpool than Arsenal

For me: City > Liverpool > United >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Arsenal Liverpool or arsenal: <sweating man button  meme> Unless we win it, I’d probably prefer Liverpool winning ahead of City or Arsenal."
2543,Chelsea,"I would say this is a miracle but actually I think we are exactly where we should be. Played Arsenal, City, United, Liverpool, Newcastle, and Brighton. Last season we would’ve had 0/18 or 3/18. This year we are 8/18, which currently is the difference between 3rd and 11th place. Our forwards aren’t exactly firing except Jackson but we are more consistent. Our position is nothing short of what we actually deserve. >Played Arsenal, City, United, Liverpool, Newcastle, and Brighton. Last season we would’ve had 0/18 or 3/18.

Come on now. At least back what you're claiming up with the real numbers. If you are going by the 1st round of fixtures we had last season against those teams you named then we were 6 points out of 18. So only 2 points shy of this seasons 8/18. 

Bearing in mind that was the very start of Chelsea basically pressing reset on the project. The players had barely ever played together before. Now they've had time to develop a reasonable sort of mid range level of cohesion within their play so they should be doing better. Its still developing but theres clearly been progress that fits the time frame thats passed.

If you were to compare the 2nd round of fixtures of those teams you mentioned to see fully how the teams developed over time. We were 10 points from the 18. 

So overall if you actually look at how the team has progressed, we arent actually taking more points from those bigger teams yet. Phase 1 was 6/18, phase 2 was 10/18 and this season if you call that phase 3 of those fixtures we are 8/18.

I think that its fair to consider the team is working with new tactics still after another managerial change so really its more of a stable progression continuing on from the work under Poch last season. We dont need to have taken more points from those teams at this stage in the Maresca stint. A good sign is simply continuing on from the 2nd half of last season as a baseline of development under a new coach.

We haven't improved on those specific results and at the moment I'm not convinced we had a chance of actually winning vs some of the bigger teams rather than just playing steady for a draw. Visually we haven't quite looked like we've got that killer edge just yet for those bigger games. Where we are really going to make up the points difference from last season is against your teams like Wolves and stuff where we struggled to find consistency against the weaker opponents."
2544,Chelsea,This season is going to be so close. Just a difference of 5 points from 10th to 2nd 
2545,Chelsea,"Need to put our foot down in December and cement our place in the Top 4.

Our depth should be massively important for this run considering we’ll be playing 9 times in a month.

(No one should be mentioning the word “title” while Jar Jar Binks is still in goal for us) "
2546,Chelsea,"Arsenal back to 4th, lovely "
2547,Chelsea,"Just beat the top teams in the second leg and we're good with title challenge ^[Sokka-Haiku](https://www.reddit.com/r/SokkaHaikuBot/comments/15kyv9r/what_is_a_sokka_haiku/) ^by ^Antique_Ad_4076:

2551,Chelsea,"If Liverpool beat City and we so much as draw against Villa....

Nope. Not even gonna whisper it... ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling) "
2552,Chelsea,Just need Liverpool to drop some points soon and the title charge is on. 
2553,Chelsea,"Dont care where we are, but we absolutely should not be below Villa, Spurs, Manu, Arsenal.

We are way better than all those "
2554,Chelsea,City are having one of the worst in the last 8 years and are sitting No 2. Jeez they have found a cheat code for the PL. 
2555,Chelsea,"I am loving the improvements but that Palace, Forrest and Manure games are still bothering me. 6 more points from those and we would have been just 3 points behind Liverpool gahhhhh "
2556,Chelsea,"We had a really poor start and to be in 3rd is amazing! 

Enzo is doing a great job so far, but we definitely need to shore up our defense "
2557,Chelsea,Happy for you 
2558,Chelsea,"We almost back, consistency will be tough "
2559,Chelsea,"If we keep this up, we have a good chance at 4th - so we can tear it up in the UCL. If we fuck up a bit too much, we could hang on to UEL. If we all of a sudden become donkeys, please don't even try to qualify for UCL. Just give it to Man U, they need it. Skip that one all together. Basically do or die this season. "
2560,Chelsea,"It's a very precarious 3rd (six points seperate us from Brentford in 11th), but it's a huge, huge improvement. Looking forward to seeing how this squad will improve! "
2561,Chelsea,"We’d be in second, ahead of city, but for Anthony Yellowcard” Taylor. "
2562,Chelsea,"After the last two whirlwind seasons, this feels like catharsis . We were the butt of jokes earlier but now, I peep into other subs now and then and they are full of admiration for the team and the process. Kudos to Maresca , the owners for their belief and to Poch for lighting the fire in the team. "
2563,Chelsea,"Above Assenal, you love to see it. Smug fucks "
2564,Chelsea,We have the best possible upcoming fixtures to start 2025 in a great position. KTBFFH 
2565,Chelsea,"I got a feeling like football gods have smiled at us a bit too much lately(rivals losing points left and right) and were due to pay back our dues for it soon. If this fixture and the tottenham one were reversed I'd feel a lot more confident, it's not that I think we cant win these, just that bad juju is bound to come down on us soon "
2566,Chelsea,One game at a time 
2567,Chelsea,If we can get a little hot streak going this month and not drop any points we have a good shot to be in a title race. 
2568,Chelsea,And almost as good as that is seeing United in 12th 
2569,Chelsea,"As a liverpool fan u arent winning the league this season tbh but u are entering the phase where ur building up to challenge

I hope chelsea finish above city "
2570,Chelsea,"Hearing that would've been more exciting if it was any other season 😂 Lmao right tell me after the last game of preseason ""you'll be 1pt behind city 1/3rd of the way through the season"" and I would have came... I'm still very happy with how the season is going, but it's a weird year Don’t care at all after the last few seasons this is incredible and I’m enjoying every second of it. Plus we are an actual good team and extremely fun to watch Still would have bitten your hand off if you told me we’d be in this position after pre season I'll take it, what with the last few seasons we've had. Glad to be back up there. It's still exciting for me after the last few seasons lol"
2571,Chelsea,I'm sure we'll overtake them next gameweek We play Villa though. That is a tough game.
2572,Chelsea,We'll be ahead of city by the time they play liverpool on Sunday 
2573,Chelsea,For some weird reason I think it ll end 0-0 but I hope Im wrong Chelsea having 0-0s? Surely not lol
2574,Chelsea,"Also seemingly no vicario against us which should be a big boost Forster is a backup keeper playing Chelsea, he may as well be Buffon Forster is not good so we need to be peppering the goal If only we were good at set pieces"
2575,Chelsea,"we are doing well, but not ""wonders"". the best he did is set up a clear gameplan and squad. still some questionable moves. its still early days. "
2576,Chelsea,"Let's not sit here and act like Poch didn't build this team tho In what sense? Didn’t he have less influence on transfers than Maresca currently does? It could also be argued that he didn’t really coach offensive tactics, evidenced by the team’s inability to score/lack of direction when in possession. He basically played counter attack and offensive improvisation. He also burned the squad out by the end of the year. Sure, the team won some preseason matches due to being in better physical condition than opponents, but it was preseason. Preseason was basically the peak of last season and the rest was downhill. Yes he had bad squad injury luck, but I don’t attribute any of this year’s success to Pochettino. Maresca deserves the credit. Poch’s work can’t be forgotten"
2577,Chelsea,That smash and grab we did away to Bournemouth is gonna live long in the memory if the table continues to be this tight Also securing a point against manu and arsenal even though they weren't our best games
2578,Chelsea,Soton as well. Let's not underestimate anyone. 
2579,Chelsea,"Liverpool are going to absolutely tear through City with the way the latter has been playing recently. And I prefer City to lose, so our odds for top 4 increase. "
2580,Chelsea,"""Closing the gap on Liverpool""...no.

We ain't winning the league or going to be in the title race. Not with Robert Sanchez in goal.

Let's just focus on getting Champions League football, where we belong first. Yea, we want a City loss realistically, anyone that can be dragged down into the mixer is good, and I don't care who wins the league so long as it's not Arsenal That’s why I put ‘be in the conversation at the end of the season…’

I don’t think we’re winning the league and it’s got nothing to do with Sanchez or singling out any one player. Our team just isn’t there yet as a whole but Liverpool don’t look unstoppable, they’ve just had a right seeing to by Southampton who can’t get a win to save their lives and other teams will do the same and other teams have done the same. City are off it. Arsenal haven’t got going yet. I’d expect all three teams to finish the season ahead of us because they’ve just got more than us right now but if we can get to April and still be around the 10 point mark of the winners. That’s a big step forward."
2581,Chelsea,"If we repeat the same results vs the big 6 in the reverse fixtures but still finish top 4 what would your reaction be? 

I'll be so real I'm not so fussed about the big 6 record THIS season if it still means we finished top 4. After all out only two Ls are vs the top two If we don’t beat the big six then we aren’t back yet. Finishing top four is a must to be on the right track to being back but I’d be happy with a top 4 finish this season no matter. 

We used to be in a title race every season. We haven’t been within 20 points of first since we won with Conte. And we’ve been about 1-4 points off missing out on top 4 for many seasons since the Conte title. Liverpool and Man City have been miles ahead of us for nearly a decade."
2582,Chelsea,As long as it's not Arsenal I don't care tbh Or Leeds but I don't think they'll win it this year tbh Thanos - Ill do it myself
2583,Chelsea,My roommate is a Liverpool fan and it's absolutely horrible Move Imagine how it will be for him if they bottle it though as they've done before. Been there. Get a good job and life and you will not cross path with him anymore Mine’s a fucking City fan. I didn’t even know those actually existed until I got to uni. This year’s been so good after the last 2.
2584,Chelsea,"I'd rather Liverpool win the league than Arsenal. Feck Arsenal 100x.

And we are not winning this league. I can almost guarantee it. Not with Robert Sanchez in goal. He is going to kill us in future matches. Until that is sorted, forget challenging.

Goals wins you games, defence wins you titles. And honestly, I'll be more than happy with just top 4 this season. Keeping my expectations under check. Anything more than that will be a lovely bonus. 

We need to get back into the UCL, most importantly. The goal isn't winning the league anyway. It's to return to the UCL. If we can finish above arsenal that's a massive plus"
2585,Chelsea,"I would rather Liverpool than Arsenal

For me: City > Liverpool > United >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Arsenal "
2586,Chelsea,"Liverpool or arsenal: <sweating man button  meme> Arsenal would be so much worse, how is that even a decision 😂😂 There’s no sweat. I’d rather Liverpool win the next 50 PL seasons than Arsenal win one lol I'd pick Liverpool before you even finish asking me that question. For me it's arsenal or United. Liverpool annoying but we lived that mess in 2019"
2587,Chelsea,"Unless we win it, I’d probably prefer Liverpool winning ahead of City or Arsenal. "
2588,Chelsea,">Played Arsenal, City, United, Liverpool, Newcastle, and Brighton. Last season we would’ve had 0/18 or 3/18.

Come on now. At least back what you're claiming up with the real numbers. If you are going by the 1st round of fixtures we had last season against those teams you named then we were 6 points out of 18. So only 2 points shy of this seasons 8/18. 

Bearing in mind that was the very start of Chelsea basically pressing reset on the project. The players had barely ever played together before. Now they've had time to develop a reasonable sort of mid range level of cohesion within their play so they should be doing better. Its still developing but theres clearly been progress that fits the time frame thats passed.

If you were to compare the 2nd round of fixtures of those teams you mentioned to see fully how the teams developed over time. We were 10 points from the 18. 

So overall if you actually look at how the team has progressed, we arent actually taking more points from those bigger teams yet. Phase 1 was 6/18, phase 2 was 10/18 and this season if you call that phase 3 of those fixtures we are 8/18.

I think that its fair to consider the team is working with new tactics still after another managerial change so really its more of a stable progression continuing on from the work under Poch last season. We dont need to have taken more points from those teams at this stage in the Maresca stint. A good sign is simply continuing on from the 2nd half of last season as a baseline of development under a new coach.

We haven't improved on those specific results and at the moment I'm not convinced we had a chance of actually winning vs some of the bigger teams rather than just playing steady for a draw. Visually we haven't quite looked like we've got that killer edge just yet for those bigger games. Where we are really going to make up the points difference from last season is against your teams like Wolves and stuff where we struggled to find consistency against the weaker opponents. "

Saying preseason was the peak of last season is ridiculous and tells me you didn't see anything that happened in the first 5 months of 2024 when we only lost 6/24 games. We literally ended the season on 5 wins in a row. The Poch disrespect is so forced😭"

Maresca has got the squad performing, and they look like they're playing for each other. 

I think the Conference League games, and squad rotation has really helped confidence.

I think we still need a big result against a big rival. Hope we can do that in the upcoming games against Villa and Tottenham. Oh I am very much aware lol

After the City game this place was in full catastrophic meltdown On Twitter and Reddit I was seeing Maresca out comments after the loss vs Celtic. You know.. The managers second match"
2621,Chelsea,"Exactly, even if by the end of the season we were 5th and had a trophy, I would be happy with the season because we've been playing more attacking football and the players are clearly getting better and in 5th we might still have UCL. "
2622,Chelsea,"Yeah but city play vs themselves and that's even harder I personally don't care about City though. They are not top of the league anyway. I care about us. 2nd would be great, but we will only be 2nd if we equal or better Arsenal's result.

I except us to be 3rd next week because Arsenal will probably have a better GD if we win."
2623,Chelsea,"true, but Villa are in pretty shocking form right now and I'm sure we'll get at least a point, that way we go ahead on goal difference should City lose, which I'm also pretty sure on Gotta beat villa tbh. Biggest win we’ve had this season is against Brighton. We gotta start beating some good teams eventually if we want to finish top 4. We have a shaky record against Villa, in our last 5 attempts in all comps - W1, D2, L2. All losses are from the Bridge.

Also keep in mind, even if we beat Villa we may still be 3rd (assuming City drop points)...to be 2nd, we have to win AND equal/better Arsenal's result."

2631,Chelsea,Cole ha 7 goals in 12 but our fans are ringing alarm bells cuz he's been quiet for 3 matches With “quiet” being still creating chances and having a goal blocked off the line by our own player lmao
2632,Chelsea,"Please

Respect palmer "
2633,Chelsea,"Foden is so overrated. Phil Foden is massively overrated. As a winger, he lacks 1v1 dribbling ability and pace, and as a midfielder, he’s too weak in duels and lacks physical and defensive competitiveness. He’s essentially just a product of playing alongside two world-class midfielders, Rodri and KDB. Foden can be overrated and still very good, right? It’s not like he’s Mason Mount."
2634,Chelsea,"Foden is out of form, he’ll be fine.   
This is a useless and unnecessary comparison. It does nothing, proves nothing, adds no meaningful conversation. It proves transfermarkt values are crap, tbf. Imagine the uproar if we sold Palmer for £75M He’s also not the player media portray him to be

For me kane, saka, palmer all comfortably better. For some reason people seem to think he’s some dynamic 10 with a great eye for a pass but I’m yet to see him thread a through ball. Palmer is way better than him though No, I can still use this to piss of my friends who talked shit on palmer when qmwe signed him.

So still useful, for petty reasons It proves that palmer is the better player, palmer is also out of form. Foden is just slightly out of form. He massively overperformed last year. Agree that this comparison is useless because Palmer is on an entirely different level. Like clockwork someone will always say this bs. Foden was nowhere close to Palmer even last season. Palmer is objectively the better player Well said He was good against Spurs. His passing is elite."
2635,Chelsea,Foden is the most overrated player in the EPL and no one will change my mind. He's always seemed like a product of a stacked squad and his abysmal England record supports that theory. Some reason there’s Chelsea fans in this sub defending him 😭
2636,Chelsea,"Man I hate comparisons of this kind. Foden isn’t having a great season by any stretch, but why should he be judged against Palmer, who is one of the best players in the league? Different situations and different roles. On their day both are fantastic players, so why can’t we appreciate them both for what they’ve achieved? You say like Foden didn’t win player of the year last year…. you cant even banter rival players anymore on this sub because you get the ""um ackshually"" crowd with the pitchforks coming out Because rival fans do not afford our players the same respect and contextual consideration. They need to be reminded to stay humble eh."
2637,Chelsea,"Did they break Foden? What happened to the player of the year? Even in his player of the year winning season he still had worse G/A than palmer while foden was playing on the best city team. the team is just very disfuntional now, you might think Haaland has great stats but he only scord 2 goals in the last 7 games. and Foden wasn't playing in those first few matches where everything was fine Wasn't it leaked that Foden suffers for burn out and is currently struggling mentaly? Ofcourse he is not going to perform."
2638,Chelsea,I think they both use the same barber 💈 
2639,Chelsea,god I hate transfer markt values so much 
2640,Chelsea,"Foden had more kids than G/A

It’s a disgrace he won POTY over Haaland, Rodri, Odegard, Palmer, or hell, even Ollie Watkins "
2641,Chelsea,"Genuinely Palmer is the better of the two players - more to his game, better versatility and range of passing - but Palmer isn’t in the elite ‘can win a game by himself’ bracket yet. Messi, CRonaldo, Salah, De Bruyne… could all just switch it on when needed. 

Think/hope Palmer can get there!! "
2642,Chelsea,Don’t think we should be posting these while Palmer’s form has been just okay The standard for Palmer is so laughably high. He is on 12 goals and assists in 12 games 12 goal contributions in 12 games is just okay? Guy gets his shot blocked on the line by a guy who has only managed to score 4 of the 12 chances he's created for him this season and suddenly he's out of form... It’s actually incredible how spoiled you are ngl
2643,Chelsea,Sweet sweet banter 
2644,Chelsea,Transfermarkt and market valuation hot takes. Name a better duo 
2645,Chelsea,"Something they have in common, terrible haircuts "
2646,Chelsea,Next up let’s compare Salah and Noni.  I’m surprised they even make this graphic. 
2647,Chelsea,Yes pointless comparison. Both great players - one currently off his game as his the entire team he plays for. 
2648,Chelsea,"Palmer is Foden if he wasn’t Pepped (Stripped of flair/initiative, pass-first instructions) "
2649,Chelsea,❄️ 
2650,Chelsea,Make it make sense 
2651,Chelsea,How the turns have tabled 
2652,Chelsea,Foden is an overrated player. Always has been. 2 years without a goal or assist for England. When your in the side to be the primary creative outlet it’s criminal. 
2653,Chelsea,"Get bent, Foden "
2654,Chelsea,May be beside the point but I think this is a really good example of the fact that transfermarkt is way too slow to adjust their market values because I don't think any neutral believes Foden is still 67% more valuable than Cole 
2655,Chelsea,€240M between them and they both still let their mom cut their hair. 
2656,Chelsea,Going by hockey points: Palmer has 12pts in 12 games. Foden has 1pt in 9 games… lol 
2657,Chelsea,"But who wins worst haircut? 

KTBFFH "
2658,Chelsea,"Both definitely not playing to the level you expect. Palmer is getting double marked and hacked most games still putting up decent numbers though. Whereas Foden has injury issues and the team just looks average in defence/offense without Rodri by their usual high standard, but yeah he’s out of form currently. "
2659,Chelsea,"Everyone is complaining about comparing Palmer and Foden on here but City punted on Cole because they rated Foden. I guarantee Cole is happy with the comparison and gets joy from out performing him. 

Keep the comparisons going it adds to the drama. "
2660,Chelsea,"Different players different teams different context. We should be happy for Palmer’s performances when we get them, and pray that Foden doesn’t pull it together. "
2661,Chelsea,Foden is not fit and probably didn’t start most of those games. Palmer is a better all round player but this is a useless comparison. 
2662,Chelsea,"Its nice to look at, but offers nothing esp since foden has been struggling with over playing He is struggling because he is not a better player than Palmer… Foden can’t play better than Palmer if he was with this Chelsea team 🤷🏾‍♂️"
2663,Chelsea,"Frankly I think both are overrated. Palmer reminds me so much of Dele Alli early on, he seemed a world beater but to me he looked like a system player, I think that’s what Palmer is You think Palmer is a system player after last season? There were literally no tactics for like 80% of the season under Poch. It was just vibes. Palmer was the system. It got to a point where players were looking to pass to him every time they were under pressure or we needed to create something, he’d come collect the ball from the bloody CBs at times and take players on near our own box. He was the system, and then a run of 6 games where everything came together at the end under Poch seemed to make everyone forget that Palmer had been keeping Poch in a job and us in contention for top 6 most of the season.

He’s the opposite of a system player. But like any player, if you play him somewhere where he can’t use his best qualities, he’ll struggle. Play him on the wing and ask him to hug the touchline with no freedom to cut inside or have someone make overlaps for him and he’ll look out the game. Play him in the 10 and have the other team manmark him all game but then not capitalise on the space/overloads that creates in other areas of the pitch and he’ll look like a passenger.

He’s a top top player and definitely not a system player, but like 99% of players, he needs a minimum amount of space to create and score chances. People need to get it into their heads that not every top player is Messi. Have to have realistic standards for them. If he’s got one or two guys tight on him all game, that’s obviously going to limit his direct impact on the game, but that does create an opportunity for a teammate to create something. None of that makes Palmer any worse of a player. It’s just the reality of what’s happening on the pitch."
2664,Chelsea,Lol 
2665,Chelsea,"With “quiet” being still creating chances and having a goal blocked off the line by our own player lmao Our fans are shameless He has been quiet,to his standards, doesn't mean he's not still having a good season overall. He's being marked out of games and both he and Maresca need to find solutions for him to find more space."
2666,Chelsea,"Phil Foden is massively overrated. As a winger, he lacks 1v1 dribbling ability and pace, and as a midfielder, he’s too weak in duels and lacks physical and defensive competitiveness. He’s essentially just a product of playing alongside two world-class midfielders, Rodri and KDB. Not just world class, kdb and rodri are (were) the absolute best. Wouldn’t say KDB even. It’s mainly Rodri. Because the best Foden’s looked in a City shirt is when KDB wasn’t injured for a lot of last season.

Truth is that City midfield has no legs, pace, physicality, ball winning ability etc without Rodri. De Bruyne, Foden, Bernardo Silva, Gundogan, Nunes, Kovacic etc are all just soo similar profile wise. Whilst we have Caicedo and Lavia, Arsenal have Rice and Partey etc, City only have Rodri. Means when he’s out, everything goes to shit, as we’ve seen.

As with any Guardiola system (or any team tbh), the DM is the lynchpin. You take him out and attacking midfielders look useless because there’s no legs or off the ball ability in the midfield.

Guarantee if you took Caicedo (and Lavia) out of our team, Palmer would be getting shat on after a couple weeks. It’s not that he’s bad because he can’t do what Caicedo does, it’s because any technical attacking midfielder needs a good DM to be able to do what they do best. Otherwise the midfield just gets overran.

Not even defending Foden. He’s definitely overrated and Palmer’s clear. But just saying that it isn’t De Bruyne making him look good. It’s that City became way too reliant on Rodri and haven’t got a backup or given enough minutes to backups, so now everyone looks shit because of poor squad management."
2667,Chelsea,"Foden can be overrated and still very good, right? It’s not like he’s Mason Mount. "
2668,Chelsea,"It proves transfermarkt values are crap, tbf. Imagine the uproar if we sold Palmer for £75M They've been used by some of the biggest clubs in world football for fiscal reports. They're not perfect and naturally player's values will lag behind their actual value if they suddenly get much better (as will happen if they suddenly get worse too and as will happen with actual fees if a player can keep up a top level over a longer period). 



Pricing in football is basically impossible to evaluate anyway. It's got so much more to do with the club's position and the player's value to both the selling club and potential value to the buying club than it does just the player in isolation. They have German bias. Players of German or Bundesliga background overrated Transfermarkt values build over years and aren't just shot up and brought down after every 15 games. Use your head."
2669,Chelsea,"He’s also not the player media portray him to be

For me kane, saka, palmer all comfortably better. For some reason people seem to think he’s some dynamic 10 with a great eye for a pass but I’m yet to see him thread a through ball. I have been calling Foden overrated. Not that he isn’t a good player but it’s clear that the system at city suits him greatly. Watch him in the England squad and he is very muted.

Would like to see him do what he does, well used to do at city (in a slump) on another team. Nah I disagree. The guy is a baller someone said that he's just a really good version of Asencio, and I think that's absolutely true"
2670,Chelsea,"Palmer is way better than him though Yes, and no sane human is stating the opposite. Palmer is clear by a wide margin."
2671,Chelsea,"No, I can still use this to piss of my friends who talked shit on palmer when qmwe signed him.

So still useful, for petty reasons "
2672,Chelsea,"It proves that palmer is the better player, palmer is also out of form. "
2673,Chelsea,Foden is just slightly out of form. He massively overperformed last year. Agree that this comparison is useless because Palmer is on an entirely different level. 
2674,Chelsea,"Like clockwork someone will always say this bs. Foden was nowhere close to Palmer even last season. Palmer is objectively the better player No shit Palmer is better. Foden is also currently out of form and no sane person would say Foden is better.   
  
Multiple things can be true"
2675,Chelsea,Well said 
2676,Chelsea,He was good against Spurs. His passing is elite. 
2677,Chelsea,Some reason there’s Chelsea fans in this sub defending him 😭 
2678,Chelsea,You say like Foden didn’t win player of the year last year…. 
2679,Chelsea,"you cant even banter rival players anymore on this sub because you get the ""um ackshually"" crowd with the pitchforks coming out "
2680,Chelsea,Because rival fans do not afford our players the same respect and contextual consideration. They need to be reminded to stay humble eh. what
2681,Chelsea,"Even in his player of the year winning season he still had worse G/A than palmer while foden was playing on the best city team. I don't understand... only the best player in the Prem would keep Cole benched for the Euros. Foden outperformed his xG last season 2x. Score 6 goals from out of the box. One on the final match day to win the title. 2 hatricks. No respect, i love Palmer but Palmer accumulated G/A via penalties. G/A is not a good metric to compare here."
2682,Chelsea,"the team is just very disfuntional now, you might think Haaland has great stats but he only scord 2 goals in the last 7 games. and Foden wasn't playing in those first few matches where everything was fine "
2683,Chelsea,"Wasn't it leaked that Foden suffers for burn out and is currently struggling mentaly? Ofcourse he is not going to perform. I don't remember a leak about that, but I sure remember Mount going through it, and he didn't have 3 kids. Foden played max matches, all of them with max pressure (as they were competing for every trophy), and still had a family to tend to. He really shouldn't have played in the Euros, you could see he was exhausted already... and despite that, SG still couldn't bench him."
2684,Chelsea,The standard for Palmer is so laughably high. He is on 12 goals and assists in 12 games 
2685,Chelsea,12 goal contributions in 12 games is just okay? lmao palmers standards have become so high now that these numbers are “okay” i love palmer and all but 8 of them were from 2 games. he hasnt shown up the past few games. so overall id say okay form aswell.
2686,Chelsea,Guy gets his shot blocked on the line by a guy who has only managed to score 4 of the 12 chances he's created for him this season and suddenly he's out of form... lol exactly
2687,Chelsea,It’s actually incredible how spoiled you are ngl 😂😂😂
2688,Chelsea,He is struggling because he is not a better player than Palmer… Foden can’t play better than Palmer if he was with this Chelsea team 🤷🏾‍♂️ Lol! Nice one
2689,Chelsea,"You think Palmer is a system player after last season? There were literally no tactics for like 80% of the season under Poch. It was just vibes. Palmer was the system. It got to a point where players were looking to pass to him every time they were under pressure or we needed to create something, he’d come collect the ball from the bloody CBs at times and take players on near our own box. He was the system, and then a run of 6 games where everything came together at the end under Poch seemed to make everyone forget that Palmer had been keeping Poch in a job and us in contention for top 6 most of the season.

He’s the opposite of a system player. But like any player, if you play him somewhere where he can’t use his best qualities, he’ll struggle. Play him on the wing and ask him to hug the touchline with no freedom to cut inside or have someone make overlaps for him and he’ll look out the game. Play him in the 10 and have the other team manmark him all game but then not capitalise on the space/overloads that creates in other areas of the pitch and he’ll look like a passenger.

He’s a top top player and definitely not a system player, but like 99% of players, he needs a minimum amount of space to create and score chances. People need to get it into their heads that not every top player is Messi. Have to have realistic standards for them. If he’s got one or two guys tight on him all game, that’s obviously going to limit his direct impact on the game, but that does create an opportunity for a teammate to create something. None of that makes Palmer any worse of a player. It’s just the reality of what’s happening on the pitch. "
2690,Chelsea,Our fans are shameless 
2691,Chelsea,"He has been quiet,to his standards, doesn't mean he's not still having a good season overall. He's being marked out of games and both he and Maresca need to find solutions for him to find more space. "
2692,Chelsea,"Not just world class, kdb and rodri are (were) the absolute best. "
2693,Chelsea,"Wouldn’t say KDB even. It’s mainly Rodri. Because the best Foden’s looked in a City shirt is when KDB wasn’t injured for a lot of last season.

Truth is that City midfield has no legs, pace, physicality, ball winning ability etc without Rodri. De Bruyne, Foden, Bernardo Silva, Gundogan, Nunes, Kovacic etc are all just soo similar profile wise. Whilst we have Caicedo and Lavia, Arsenal have Rice and Partey etc, City only have Rodri. Means when he’s out, everything goes to shit, as we’ve seen.

As with any Guardiola system (or any team tbh), the DM is the lynchpin. You take him out and attacking midfielders look useless because there’s no legs or off the ball ability in the midfield.

Guarantee if you took Caicedo (and Lavia) out of our team, Palmer would be getting shat on after a couple weeks. It’s not that he’s bad because he can’t do what Caicedo does, it’s because any technical attacking midfielder needs a good DM to be able to do what they do best. Otherwise the midfield just gets overran.

Not even defending Foden. He’s definitely overrated and Palmer’s clear. But just saying that it isn’t De Bruyne making him look good. It’s that City became way too reliant on Rodri and haven’t got a backup or given enough minutes to backups, so now everyone looks shit because of poor squad management. "
2694,Chelsea,"They've been used by some of the biggest clubs in world football for fiscal reports. They're not perfect and naturally player's values will lag behind their actual value if they suddenly get much better (as will happen if they suddenly get worse too and as will happen with actual fees if a player can keep up a top level over a longer period).

2695,Chelsea,They have German bias. Players of German or Bundesliga background overrated German bias doesn't explain why Palmer is valued at half of foden though
2696,Chelsea,Transfermarkt values build over years and aren't just shot up and brought down after every 15 games. Use your head. Wow thanks for that info; they’re still fucking useless. Dolt.
2697,Chelsea,"I have been calling Foden overrated. Not that he isn’t a good player but it’s clear that the system at city suits him greatly. Watch him in the England squad and he is very muted.

Would like to see him do what he does, well used to do at city (in a slump) on another team. Absolutely. And for those who say but Southgate’s England were average. Saka and Palmer still performed much much better than Foden for England."
2698,Chelsea,Nah I disagree. The guy is a baller Never said he wasn’t a good player
2699,Chelsea,"someone said that he's just a really good version of Asencio, and I think that's absolutely true "
2700,Chelsea,"Yes, and no sane human is stating the opposite. Palmer is clear by a wide margin. "
2701,Chelsea,"No shit Palmer is better. Foden is also currently out of form and no sane person would say Foden is better.   
  
Multiple things can be true "
2702,Chelsea,what Did he stutter?
2703,Chelsea,I don't understand... only the best player in the Prem would keep Cole benched for the Euros. or the worst possible manager...
2704,Chelsea,"Foden outperformed his xG last season 2x. Score 6 goals from out of the box. One on the final match day to win the title. 2 hatricks. No respect, i love Palmer but Palmer accumulated G/A via penalties. G/A is not a good metric to compare here. Palmer was 0.83 npG+A/90 and Foden was 0.85 G+A/90


That was with Foden playing for the title winners in a team he's been at for years under the greatest manager of all time, and Palmer in his first proper season of professional football, at a new club he joined missing preseason that finished midtable the season before, with a lemon fucker for a manager. Pretty impressive Palmer managed to rack assists up from the penalty spot!"
2705,Chelsea,"I don't remember a leak about that, but I sure remember Mount going through it, and he didn't have 3 kids.

2706,Chelsea,"lmao palmers standards have become so high now that these numbers are “okay” No, it's just that in 10 games he's contributed to 4 goals. That's okay by general standards."
2707,Chelsea,"i love palmer and all but 8 of them were from 2 games. he hasnt shown up the past few games. so overall id say okay form aswell. Teams are committing resources (and fouls) to take him out of the games to the benefit of the rest of the squad. Thank you, just what I was trying to imply. Not a knock on him What do you mean he hasn't shown up? He had a goal cleared off the line by Madueke! Forgot goals don’t count if you score multiple in a game"
2708,Chelsea,lol exactly 
2709,Chelsea,😂😂😂 
2710,Chelsea,Lol! Nice one 
2711,Chelsea,German bias doesn't explain why Palmer is valued at half of foden though It explains why they are overvaluing Philipp Faden 🇩🇪
2712,Chelsea,Wow thanks for that info; they’re still fucking useless. Dolt. 
2713,Chelsea,Absolutely. And for those who say but Southgate’s England were average. Saka and Palmer still performed much much better than Foden for England.

2718,Chelsea,Pretty impressive Palmer managed to rack assists up from the penalty spot! 
2719,Chelsea,"No, it's just that in 10 games he's contributed to 4 goals. That's okay by general standards. For fucking Messi maybe"

2723,Chelsea,"Forgot goals don’t count if you score multiple in a game That's not the point. The point is, if over 10 games you score all 10 in 1 game and goose egg the rest, it's less effective than 1 goal in each 10 games. Cole's stats aren't exactly to that extreme of a disparity, but that's the general idea. was talking about his recent form which if you look at it is okay after the insane start he had to the season which was my point. ffs he set the record for the most goals in a single half, he is one of the best players in pl history already with that."
2724,Chelsea,It explains why they are overvaluing Philipp Faden 🇩🇪 
2725,Chelsea,Ok I get you 
2726,Chelsea,"See, I am not denying that Palmer is a fantastic player. But last season was Foden's season. Foden wasn't even the best player on his own team last season tbh, the POTY award was dumb. Rodri should've won it, Watkins should've been runner up, Haaland (even though he wasn't *as* good as the season before) should've been over Foden, and I'd have put Palmer over him as well."
2727,Chelsea,For fucking Messi maybe That would be the worst run of messis career Okay for Messi would still be probably 1 goal or assist per game over a 10 games stretch or slightly below that.
2728,Chelsea,"That's not the point. The point is, if over 10 games you score all 10 in 1 game and goose egg the rest, it's less effective than 1 goal in each 10 games. Cole's stats aren't exactly to that extreme of a disparity, but that's the general idea. "

2730,Chelsea,"He should be rested on Thursday. Doing back to back matches after running 11km is a recipe for disaster given our injury luck. Lol I think i heard he came back from intl duty on the wednesday? I could be wrong though No way he starts There's no reason we should stop doing the full rotated 11 until the knokouts
. If anyone can afford to do extra miles, it's him. Yep. Enzo, caicedo, lavia trio against villa."
2731,Chelsea,I don't know what his wife was doing to him... But damn. Durex calling him every day for sponsership deal Lmao Context? Lol
2732,Chelsea,All that extra energy being a bachelor now. We reap all the benefits lol 
2733,Chelsea,"Surprised Felix didn’t cover the most ground.  He was pressing out of his mind i’ve never seen him press that hard for us, he really wanted to repay Maresca’s faith in starting him and i love that from Felix

i really like the idea of having Palmer and Felix together if the latter will press like that, Palmer isn’t physically the best at press so having another #10 who isn’t afraid to go some yards back is quite nice He's probably up there, won the most duels of any Chelsea player"
2734,Chelsea,This is your sign to leave your wives /s 🤣🤣🤣
2735,Chelsea,"Some fans want this guy to be dropped 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ He generally needs to play better, but yeah we created way more when he's playing. If he keeps it up how he played Sunday, were cooking It took a handful of Caicedo-Lavia matches for all the dedicated Enzo haters to go quiet. "
2736,Chelsea,Divorced Enzo Fernandez is a new mythical footballer 
2737,Chelsea,Literally running wild.. professionally and maritally.. if thsts a word Indeed it is!  You spelled it right and used it in proper context.  You do have a typo on a different word though hahaha Oh well!  Up the Chels!
2738,Chelsea,"You can always tell he fights for the badge, and I love that about him. Now hes putting in the performances to match that passion! "
2739,Chelsea,"Bro ditched his wife and kids, now all of the sudden he looks like the £100 million player. "
2740,Chelsea,Have we considered maybe his wife was awful? 
2741,Chelsea,"In current form, Enzo > Lavia. Lavia has been underwhelming for a while now. Enzo also makes Palmer play more in the attacking third. "
2742,Chelsea,Tears in my eyes we've finally replaced Gallagher 
2743,Chelsea,"This was considered a bad stat last year. Can you cover more distance technically? If so, Enzo is him. "
2744,Chelsea,Insert joke about running away from his wife here… 
2745,Chelsea,"Now this is the Enzo from the Potter period we loved, adding extra cardio and mobility to his game will make him hard to drop. "
2746,Chelsea,"Only came in here for the ""fuck them kids"" meme.


Disappointed. "
2747,Chelsea,Running away from wife .... 
2748,Chelsea,"I think i heard he came back from intl duty on the wednesday? I could be wrong though Yea I think he came back very late. Crazy performance for him coming off that, deff needs to be rested Thursday"
2749,Chelsea,No way he starts 
2750,Chelsea,"There's no reason we should stop doing the full rotated 11 until the knokouts
. "
2751,Chelsea,"If anyone can afford to do extra miles, it's him. "
2752,Chelsea,"Yep. Enzo, caicedo, lavia trio against villa. Really? Why? Hopefully that’s what’s on the menu IMO, suffocate the shit out of Villa."
2753,Chelsea,Durex calling him every day for sponsership deal 
2754,Chelsea,Lmao 
2755,Chelsea,Context? Lol He divorced and then started playing much better.
2756,Chelsea,"i’ve never seen him press that hard for us, he really wanted to repay Maresca’s faith in starting him and i love that from Felix

i really like the idea of having Palmer and Felix together if the latter will press like that, Palmer isn’t physically the best at press so having another #10 who isn’t afraid to go some yards back is quite nice Palmer is a sneaky good presser though.  He’s had a few goals solely because he’s good at predicting passes and jumping passing lanes Because it was his best chance to impress and get to A-team He pressed well when he came on loan trying to impress at first, but this game was even better Is really good but not with Palmer as 10. I want to see Sancho - Felix - Palmer with Gusto overlapping in the right. The flair with these 3 will be over the roof. With Jackson in front I somehow see Hazard - Willian - Pedro - Batshuayi. These together were unreal with the flair, they were just a joy to watch. I will never forget ""the goal"" against Brighton."
2757,Chelsea,"He's probably up there, won the most duels of any Chelsea player "
2758,Chelsea,🤣🤣🤣 
2759,Chelsea,"He generally needs to play better, but yeah we created way more when he's playing. If he keeps it up how he played Sunday, were cooking Mate he plays good all the time just watch all the games again and focus on him and how he plays, watch the work he is doing, that how you watch football, there is so many game he has to go back help the build up, if he was shit like some people say he wouldn’t be on of the coach favourites, people just need to stop getting their opinions from internet."
2760,Chelsea,It took a handful of Caicedo-Lavia matches for all the dedicated Enzo haters to go quiet.  
2761,Chelsea,Indeed it is!  You spelled it right and used it in proper context.  You do have a typo on a different word though hahaha Oh well!  Up the Chels! 
2762,Chelsea,"Yea I think he came back very late. Crazy performance for him coming off that, deff needs to be rested Thursday Id like to see what maresca does mid week if enzo is rested and theres no caicedo or lavia, kdh starts imo with maybe casadei?"
2763,Chelsea,Really? Why? Then Palmer on the RW. Noni is just wasting chances at this time. Matching Villa midfield is very imperative cause their wingers are nothing burger.
2764,Chelsea,"Hopefully that’s what’s on the menu IMO, suffocate the shit out of Villa. Exactly"
2765,Chelsea,He divorced and then started playing much better. Oh yeah forgot that haha maybe it's a post break up focus
2766,Chelsea,Palmer is a sneaky good presser though.  He’s had a few goals solely because he’s good at predicting passes and jumping passing lanes He got the insane instincts but lacks the physicality
2767,Chelsea,Because it was his best chance to impress and get to A-team 
2768,Chelsea,"He pressed well when he came on loan trying to impress at first, but this game was even better "
2769,Chelsea,"Is really good but not with Palmer as 10. I want to see Sancho - Felix - Palmer with Gusto overlapping in the right. The flair with these 3 will be over the roof.

He got dropped to the UECL for a couple of games..

I am a huge Enzo fan. Not a hater by any means. But I think Enzo would be the first to tell you he didn't start this season the best. He had a few rough games. But I think we are a better team with him in it."
2771,Chelsea,"Id like to see what maresca does mid week if enzo is rested and theres no caicedo or lavia, kdh starts imo with maybe casadei? Why wouldn't Lavia play? He's fit now so this would be a good bounce back game for him. Casadei was playing really well in the conference league. Would love to see him and Carney in the midfield Casadei 6, KDH 8 (a la Enzo on Saturday), Carney and Nkunku as the 10s (like Felix and Palmer on Saturday).

Mr. Maresca make it happen. mybe KDG with Veiga as MF, and Badi, Tosin, Disasi and Gusto (if fit) in defence Casadei and KDH have played together more in that competition than any other midfield combo. Carney should also be given opportunity in this game. Of course for the most difficult game so far in the UECL. Great planning on that one. man who cares, its the conf league"
2772,Chelsea,"Then Palmer on the RW. Noni is just wasting chances at this time. Matching Villa midfield is very imperative cause their wingers are nothing burger. I'd rather we go with the Leicester set up (e.g. left width coming from Cucu, right width from an actual right winger, Felix and Palmer as the 10s) but with Neto instead of Noni. Play Palmer in a role that doesn’t suit him as well and then ask him to do more defensive work, just to play 3 central mids next to him"
2773,Chelsea,Exactly 
2774,Chelsea,Oh yeah forgot that haha maybe it's a post break up focus More likely that the relationship started devolving much earlier... Reverse Kepa
2775,Chelsea,He got the insane instincts but lacks the physicality I feel like people underestimate his acceleration.  He may not be the fastest sprinter but he gets up to his top speed faster than anyone else on the pitch
2776,Chelsea,"He got dropped to the UECL for a couple of games..

I am a huge Enzo fan. Not a hater by any means. But I think Enzo would be the first to tell you he didn't start this season the best. He had a few rough games. But I think we are a better team with him in it. > He got dropped to the UECL for a couple of games..

That has a lot less to do with him being bad, and more to do with picking more defensive lineups for a stretch of tough games. We're in a good position where we can pick and choose based on the opposition. He didn’t get dropped because he was bad, he got dropped because the coach wanted more physicality in midfield You mean the same competition palmer isnt even registered too? Is UECL mate is not champions league this is a player used to playing top games, World Cup winner do you really think he wants to play UECL"
2777,Chelsea,Why wouldn't Lavia play? He's fit now so this would be a good bounce back game for him. Is he registered for uecl?
2778,Chelsea,"Casadei was playing really well in the conference league. Would love to see him and Carney in the midfield He was, i hope to see more of him actually i doubt carney would play i hope im wrong cause hes one of my favourite players tbh"
2779,Chelsea,"Casadei 6, KDH 8 (a la Enzo on Saturday), Carney and Nkunku as the 10s (like Felix and Palmer on Saturday).

Mr. Maresca make it happen. I dont see carney playing, i dont know why but i dont have faith in enzo playing him, but id like to see who you listed, i think we play 2 10s only when a team is set up to defend like leicester was but im here for it if it works out going forward"
2780,Chelsea,"mybe KDG with Veiga as MF, and Badi, Tosin, Disasi and Gusto (if fit) in defence Veiga!! I knew i forgot someone, but then maybe veiga at lb inverting, (he needs a lot of minutes there if we plan on using him there), kdh and casadei would also be a good shout, maybe casadei and veiga with kdh pushing up like enzo does🤷‍♂️

The backline is fairly easy to call unless badi does a back to back, gusto i think will sit this one out or maybe even bench with a small cameo🤷‍♂️"
2781,Chelsea,"Casadei and KDH have played together more in that competition than any other midfield combo. Carney should also be given opportunity in this game. Ive seen carney pop up a few times, i really hope he plays, but imo i dont see it happening, i didnt know casadei and kdh played together a few times already, probably not paying attention😅"
2782,Chelsea,Of course for the most difficult game so far in the UECL. Great planning on that one. I mean if our B midfield gets overrun by Heidenheim then we probably have bigger problems than just that one game lol More just bad timing.
2783,Chelsea,"man who cares, its the conf league Unfortunately I do…since im a supporter of the club and…im excited to see what new ideas the manager has for my team…"
2784,Chelsea,"I'd rather we go with the Leicester set up (e.g. left width coming from Cucu, right width from an actual right winger, Felix and Palmer as the 10s) but with Neto instead of Noni. "
2785,Chelsea,"Play Palmer in a role that doesn’t suit him as well and then ask him to do more defensive work, just to play 3 central mids next to him How does playing off the right not suit Palmer? It's literally where he had his breakout performances for Chelsea.


I can understand why he was moved centrally to get him even more involved and to make room for Madueke, who was on a tear, but it hasn't really benefited Palmer much."
2786,Chelsea,More likely that the relationship started devolving much earlier... 
2787,Chelsea,Reverse Kepa 
2788,Chelsea,I feel like people underestimate his acceleration.  He may not be the fastest sprinter but he gets up to his top speed faster than anyone else on the pitch 
2789,Chelsea,"> He got dropped to the UECL for a couple of games..

That has a lot less to do with him being bad, and more to do with picking more defensive lineups for a stretch of tough games. We're in a good position where we can pick and choose based on the opposition. Exactly. If we get top 4, it’d be playing in UCL or PL. our second team has a good luxury of having midweek matches to impress and also show where they can slot in to help (like Enzo being more offense for kid or Felix operating with Palmer for a dual 10-type style)"
2790,Chelsea,"He didn’t get dropped because he was bad, he got dropped because the coach wanted more physicality in midfield "
2791,Chelsea,You mean the same competition palmer isnt even registered too? I’m confused at what you are saying

I mean you said he was one of the coaches favorites. I said, well he got dropped out of the A team for a few games. Clearly Maresca thought he should be playing better too. Hes a good player and Im glad he's starting to really shine now. We are better when he's in the side. And I like Lavia."
2793,Chelsea,"Is he registered for uecl? Damn, I don't think he is. Will be an interesting line up for sure in midfield, kind of excited to see what Maresca comes up with"
2794,Chelsea,"He was, i hope to see more of him actually i doubt carney would play i hope im wrong cause hes one of my favourite players tbh "
2795,Chelsea,"I dont see carney playing, i dont know why but i dont have faith in enzo playing him, but id like to see who you listed, i think we play 2 10s only when a team is set up to defend like leicester was but im here for it if it works out going forward "
2796,Chelsea,"Veiga!! I knew i forgot someone, but then maybe veiga at lb inverting, (he needs a lot of minutes there if we plan on using him there), kdh and casadei would also be a good shout, maybe casadei and veiga with kdh pushing up like enzo does🤷‍♂️

The backline is fairly easy to call unless badi does a back to back, gusto i think will sit this one out or maybe even bench with a small cameo🤷‍♂️ "
2797,Chelsea,"Ive seen carney pop up a few times, i really hope he plays, but imo i dont see it happening, i didnt know casadei and kdh played together a few times already, probably not paying attention😅 "
2798,Chelsea,I mean if our B midfield gets overrun by Heidenheim then we probably have bigger problems than just that one game lol We’ve seen the huge drop off from our first string to KDH and casadei. Lavia’s durability is a known problem. We do have a big problem with injuries in this squad and our backup CMs are weak.
2799,Chelsea,More just bad timing. 
2800,Chelsea,"Unfortunately I do…since im a supporter of the club and…im excited to see what new ideas the manager has for my team… yah, sure, i love watching us play and all the young player development. but the point being, who cares who plays. do you see our opposition? just rest our starting squad fully"
2801,Chelsea,"How does playing off the right not suit Palmer? It's literally where he had his breakout performances for Chelsea.


I can understand why he was moved centrally to get him even more involved and to make room for Madueke, who was on a tear, but it hasn't really benefited Palmer much. Except it has. He has more goals and assists from open play when playing in the middle. Most of his goals when he played on the right were penalties. It's objective fact that he is much better playing centrally. It does suit Palmer, but not in Maresca's system. Palmer isn't a typical Maresca winger who holds width and tracks back.
For it to work, we need to have a fullback overlapping  (Gusto is perfect for that role). 
But I don't think Maresca is changing his core formation, albeit we have seen him make tactical tweaks."
2802,Chelsea,"Exactly. If we get top 4, it’d be playing in UCL or PL. our second team has a good luxury of having midweek matches to impress and also show where they can slot in to help (like Enzo being more offense for kid or Felix operating with Palmer for a dual 10-type style) "
2803,Chelsea,I’m confused at what you are saying

Someone already answered to this mate, do be part of the anti Enzo agenda, whoever says Enzo is not a good player doesn’t not understand football"
2805,Chelsea,"Damn, I don't think he is. Will be an interesting line up for sure in midfield, kind of excited to see what Maresca comes up with KDH and Casadei screw it. Maybe someone can correct us but i dont think he was considering he only plays once a week, and im excited to see what maresca does for the midfield!"
2806,Chelsea,"We’ve seen the huge drop off from our first string to KDH and casadei. Lavia’s durability is a known problem. We do have a big problem with injuries in this squad and our backup CMs are weak. I agree CM is probably our ""thinnest"" position outside of maybe wing back but, I still think KDH and Casadei can and should be able to handle Heidenheim with an inverting wing back helping them out. We're talking about a near relegation team in Bundesliga at the moment....


We also have Viega who can fill in as a 6. Although this should be a rest day for Cucu so unlikely that it's a serious option at this point. 

Also we're not in any danger of not qualifying for the knockouts. Even if we don't look great and draw Heidenheim that's more than ok to qualify. The rest of the schedule is super easy we can get 2 wins with our C team against them."

2823,Chelsea,"I think Maresca is gonna to back to his normal 2 winger system against Villa, and he’s gonna start Noni and Neto due their pace and the space Villa leave in behind. I only hope he starts Enzo and Caicedo instead of Caicedo Lavia, unless he’s gonna overlap a fullback. Gusto inverting into the 10 makes both Palmer and Madueke worse. Please not madueke again, start sancho and neto. enzo caicedo leaves us too exposed, it's fine against smaller sides like Leicester, but it'd be naive to play them both against villa"

Anything short of starting an entire 11 of youth graduates in the prem is considered not good enough for some of them. Felix Johnston usually has good coverage, I’m fairly certain every single person on earth is blocked by that melt Chelsea youth"

Now lemme see Ryan Flamingo interest and I'll be a happy happy man Pls not that 70 fkin million pricetag again and I'm into that Guehi purchase. I’d rather us splash on Branthwaite than Guehi tbh, Flamingo would be a great signing but I doubt we get him coz I see us definitely buying Araujo"

How does one get points if not buying laugher conference league tickets in mid December?! I get the point of it (and admittedly don't have a fool proof better system in mind), but unless you get every ticket available up to and including October, which is a ball ache of a task in itself, then membership from that point onwards becomes pretty useless.

Think the most stupid part of it all is that you don't get rewarded with points by buying on the exchange"

Few things gets more interactions than someone claiming to be a fan and then shitting on their own club. Rival fans love that. i’ve literally never seen that angry little goblin have a remotely good take But he's right. Clearlake have gutted the club of it's identity and betrayed the club's supporters and we aren't even better than last season. We could have kept Pochettino, Chalobah, and Gallagher while integrating Josh Acheampong and maintained the form we ended with last season and the fans would be happier with the state of the club."

2836,Chelsea,"I've been a long term critique of Jackson, but he's slowly winning me over. The only weakness in our squad now, is Sanchez. We *need* a top class keeper, it should be our main, urgent requirement in January, or the summer. The goal last week is not something I thought Jackson had in his bag. It was sick We still need a striker to challenge Jackson. Duran would literally be perfect. Someone to come off the bench and win aerial duels and bully the defense. Yeah new CB and GK can do wonders for us, i know this might be far fetched but I think buying Christensen could do wonders for us considering he can play the inverted CB role. This could help us playing Felix/Enzo as a proper 8 alongside Palmer."
2837,Chelsea,"Madueke really needs to be bringing more to the table than he is with how we play.


[Compare average position for us](https://i.imgur.com/CMMTaJC.jpeg) and for [Liverpool](https://i.imgur.com/RxPF2vt.jpeg) and Madueke is basically getting the Salah treatment. Obviously Salah is the best player in the league right now so I'm not expecting him to put up Salah numbers, but 1 goal and 0 assists in his last 10 Premier League games is shocking output. With how Maresca is utilising Madueke he needs to be returning goals and assists on a near weekly basis otherwise too much pressure is just going to fall on Palmer and Jackson and we're going to drop points. 


Some more examples from this season to show it's not a one off:


[Chelsea One](https://preview.redd.it/8s95pafv8oxd1.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d3a6e931d8d4e6c621c5233bb99eb2631362aa6) [Two](https://preview.redd.it/t9z1yy65wdtd1.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ca35b5836f5a7488cead85d31070a53f3cc61b7) [Three](https://preview.redd.it/lgqxw5y7eb0e1.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39c4edba34f1b541d4a9f26b6da8dd030e4f3346)

Both in a title winning Leicester side had a similar G+A per 90 compared to Noni (and Neto) right now, as well as in xG/xA per 90 if we want to consider luck as a factor 

The issue with the Salah comparison is that he is given 20x more freedom (this year especially, it's out of necessity) to be a primary goal threat. He's an inside forward. (Somewhat irrelevant but its also why hazard vs salah debates are so fucking annoying to me) You should be comparing Noni to actual touchline wingers. Doku and Savinho would be perfect examples of the ""standard"", as they have genuinely ridiculous dribbling stats but their G/A isn't very impressive. They're testaments to how they're both some of the best wingers in the league without being goal threats It’s funny how he’s finally started to track back and now people are acting like he’s some defensive stalwart that must play for balance reason Madueke simply isn't good enough, no way should he be starting if neto and sancho are fit. All he can bring to the table is hope that we can even break even on him. 

 Haphazard how such a flawed player has such an ego. I'd be dreaming we sold him in January and gave his chances to Tyrique George instead. He might not be the better player yet, but at least he doesn't act like an idiot, can improve, and at worst we can just use Neto RW and Sancho LW."
2838,Chelsea,"The line up I think Maresca will put out on Thursday:


                   Jorgensen

   Disasi - Tosin - Badiashile - Veiga

                Casedei - KDH

       Sancho - Felix - Mudryk

                     Nkunku You’re probably right but TBH Mudryk might be a great players to start against Villa with that stupid high line they play. Neto and Mudryk running in behind could be deadly against those guys. [deleted]"
2839,Chelsea,"Felix Johnston says we are making [tentative progress](https://x.com/FelixJohnston_/status/1861442389472157720) on the Acheampong situation, but pathway is understandably a concern.

Interestingly enough, we've heard rumours of big clubs sniffing about, and Felix names PSG, RM, Dortmund, Liverpool and Bayern. Christ. Our behavior in sorting this out has looked quite unprofessional from the outside, but honestly, it smells like someone is being tapped up. And I can understand our directors being vary of another situation like McAidoo/Rio where they are snatched away having their heads turned by another big club (albeit a bit different of a situation admittedly). Losing him on a free is something they really want to avoid.

I mean, Bayern have apparently come in and promised him first team minutes immediately. Tough to see, if thats true, how we wouldn't take drastic measures to tie him to a new contract. If he gets fooled by Bayern after what they’ve done to young players just like him I will be shocked. He has a pathway here because of the unreliable nature of Reece and Gusto also being quite injury prone, there’s a pathway there maybe he just don’t rate himself high enough to prove it. He has to look at the James situation and fancy his chances of getting minutes this season. No reason why he can’t force himself into the B team.

Sounds to me like his agent is chasing the £££ The standoff is doubly annoying when you consider that the ECL is pretty much a perfect stage to start integrating him and that James is James. >Losing him on a free is something they really want to avoid.

Realistically, how much is he even worth? At 18 with 37 minutes of first team football, I don't really see any value in him from a transfer fee. Sure he has a lot of promise, but he's at least 3-5 seasons away from really competing for a starting spot in a top club, and that's with him making leaps in his development through those years. I get that we want to keep our academy players in house, but if he's not signing a contract there's not much we can do. We've shown that we won't break our wage structure for even proven players, so it's really on him to decide if what we're offering is enough. he’s got someone whispering in his ear about money because his pathway here is the same as any of the teams he’s linked with lmao. if he wants to play hardball then i have no problem with the board playing hardball back."

2843,Chelsea,"Madueke needs to be in the B team lineup vs Heidenheim. Do you think Maresca will put him in the B team? I’d like to see Guiu up front with Sancho, Nkunku, and Madueke behind."
2844,Chelsea,"Guehi links don’t excite me whatsoever man Massively overrated here Tbf the CB market is pretty dry atm. He’s proven at this level, he’s a starter for England, he’s got experience as a captain and he’s ex Cobham. He’d automatically be in competition for a starting spot with Fofana or Colwill. We could do a lot worse than binning off Tosin, Disasi or Badiashile and bringing him in. There are Guehi links?? If so, I’m on the contrary excited af, I’ve been begging for his return for ages"

2847,Chelsea,"[100% speculation, but interesting](https://www.leicestercity.news/opinion/three-chelsea-players-graham-potter-could-sign-at-leicester-city-including-surprise-return-for-former-star/)

If LEI hire Potter, would he want to buy Chuk, Chilly and Axel D? Probably not. Also Disasi never played under him and the description of him in that article is interesting. Where are these 'decent performances' they speak of? Leicester fans dislike Chilwell so I doubt that’d happen"
2848,Chelsea,"Acheampong surely sees there’s a pathway to minutes with Reece out? Anyway I will say he’s looked slightly shaky in the limited minutes he got in preseason and other games (albeit in limited minutes). He’d have to earn those minutes He's gotta sign a contract first. We'll keep rotating Gusto, Fofana, and Disasi there until he does.

Edit: Just catching up on the recent talks about a contract. I'm real surprised he hasn't realized that he'd be #2 behind Gusto. Reece hasn't been reliable for a few seasons now so he'd be getting tons of playing time if he develops like he expects to. His agent seems to be shopping around. he’s following in money mases footsteps and chasing the bag Acheampong probably wants the bag 


You don't look at clubs like Real Madrid, Bayern, Liverpool etc etc and think there's my pathway 



Especially when you're at a club that has only one right back in Gusto who's barely older than you and Reece James who at this point is potentially legally recognizable as a part time member of Chelsea football club"

2856,Chelsea,"With Man City having another very poor performance, should second place in the prem now become our main target? I think so. "
2857,Chelsea,"Mitoma is probably my favorite winger right now. Putting other more urgent needs in our squad aside, what are your thoughts on him, I think he would be a big upgrade on our attack? Nahh, not an upgrade. Aside from dribbling I don't think he's got anything over our current lws. 

His g/a are pretty mid as well. Plus he's 27,no way we go for him and even if we do those brighton a**holes would demand 100mil. We definitely don't need more wingers, and honestly, I don't think it's worth clearing out any of our wingers for Mitoma.

I mean, he's better than some of what we have, but not enough of an upgrade to move mountains for. mitoma would be brilliant…..for our rehabilitation programme I'm not sure about him but he is probably leaps and bounds better than Mudryk."
2858,Chelsea,"Also I'm giving a lot of you a chance to hop on the Badiashile train right now 

He's very quickly going to cement himself as a starter and a very important player for us, especially in that LCB role. I can see it. 

If you don't see the vision, just trust mine. And if you don't trust my vision, that's okay, but I will be coming back to laugh when the Badiashile - Desailly comparisons begin 

He's just like Enzo. Everyone said Enzo was shit because he was unfit for the PL, too slow, can't do X can't do Y.. whole time it was probably his annoying wife holding him back. Badiashile is the same, except instead of an annoying wife it was Disasi Badiashile is one of those players who can perform really good 1 game, and next game he’ll make some bad errors. 
All about consistency with him. It definitely helped him last game, having our best defenders around him (Cucu, Colwill and Fofana). He looked more confident in that match. welp i was always in the badi hype train, happy to see him slowly regaining his form Wtf I can't tell if you're serious or not lmao He’s getting sold mate. He’s not going to displace Colwill or Fofana because frankly they are better fits for the style we play. And ultimately, I’d hope at least, we’ll buy a world class CB to replace one of Colwill or Fofana. Badiashile suits marescas system even more than both fofana and colwill do.

maresca likes players who can play in multiple positions, badiashile suits maresca more because he can do a job both at ccb and lcb, where as fofana can really only play rcb because he doesn’t have the passing ability to be ccb, and colwill can really only be affective lcb because he doesn’t have the physicality to play lcb.

We’ve already had plenty of balance issues this season and one of the main issues for it is the fofana and colwill pairing, if we had 2 players of badishilles profile for lcb and rcb, ALOT of our balance issues would be fixed.

I’m not saying badiashile is better than them, as their respective roles fofana and colwill are better than him, but at being both a wide cb and a ccb badishille is better."
2859,Chelsea,"i really don’t understand the english sports media. do you guys not have dedicated sports networks with hosts and analysts? like why is so much of the prems media coverage from the same like four retired players with zero ball knowledge or small twitter / podcast idiots? Totally agree. The ex players provide more of a pub discussion rather than actual coherent in depth analysis \>  the same like four retired players with zero ball knowledge

https://preview.redd.it/vmv348x0ya3e1.jpeg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=134080cd5c29d08e9236aa68297206c47ed57056 He's a good young player with potential, his current form has been poor while neto has been playing well so I expect when he's fit neto will start games over madueke especially now sancho is back to play LW.

Things look a bit worse for madueke next year as he'll be competing for RW with neto and estevao. Overhated i love madueke discourse because so much of it would not exist if his body language wasn’t naturally negative lmao Serviceable rw, the majority of our attacks go through him but I feel like he gets way too much of the ball for what he actually does with it. The optimal situation would be having a healthy rivalry between him and Neto. He's important because he always takes people on. Having a least one winger who's happy to just fucking go at people is good.  It'd be better if he was successful more, but the fact he tries makes space for others He’s clearly just not very good I don’t even know why there’s much discourse online I’m guessing it’s kids watching TikTok videos of his “skills” because I don’t know a single person who watches us for 90 minutes and thinks
Madueke does enough.

Think he’ll he moved on this summer."
2864,Chelsea,"3 signings in Jan/Summer and we can win the league

Keeper- Sanchez ain't it. Stop buying a million keeps and go get Diogo Costa

Striker- Jackson is class, but we need a striker who can win aerial duels more consistently to deputize.

CB- Been impressed with Fofana, still think we need another right sided CB and sell Disasi. Another mobile, strong CB (rare) who can play on the right side would also lessen the impact of potentially losing Reece. Not in January but Hermansen, Delap and Guehi"
2865,Chelsea,"Yeah. I feel he will be the 9 and Nkunku will be the 10 like everyone wants.

Since Felix will be playing on Sunday. It should be the other way around. Felix got his chance versus Leicester, give it to Nkunku now for Aston Villa. 

We will pay severely if we don't give him a chance."
2866,Chelsea,"Yeah, hate Spuds but they’ve got a real talent in Vicario, he was a brick wall in the second half against City despite breaking his ankle "
2867,Chelsea,"You used to rate him pretty highly mate No, he did not lol. I did and I remember specifically fighting this dude on it. I was wrong, obviously. https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/s/oV2W22rvL8


I don't think so lol


Edit: 

Even clear version of my Evan Ferguson views 

https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/s/dQ3efDPYLK"
2868,Chelsea,"Please not madueke again, start sancho and neto. Sorry, but Maresca has a headband addiction."
2869,Chelsea,"enzo caicedo leaves us too exposed, it's fine against smaller sides like Leicester, but it'd be naive to play them both against villa It only leaves us exposed because Maresca wants us to push Enzo up high 

I'm certain if we had Enzo sit next to Caicedo all game we wouldn't look bad defensively 

But at the same time there's no point doing that if we have Lavia, which is why if we need 2 holding midfielders then we can do Lavia x Caicedo and use Enzo as backup if we need attacking subs Seriously, this narrative that Caicedo and Enzo can't work together from a defensive point of view against the better sides is funny.

And speaking of Villa, we literally played them both against that opponent last season and had the measure of them (despite some of the results). The problem is Caicedo Lavia leaves us struggling for chance creation, because Lavia is worse at progressing the ball than Enzo and because it puts the possession black hole of Gusto in the 10 while Palmer is pushed left.


Tbh, if he was gonna play Caicedo Lavia, I’d rather have him invert Cucurella into the 10, underlapping Sancho, becuase that combination worked well before and it pushes Palmer to the right. But inverting Cucurella means playing Badiashile, which I don’t think the defensive stability crowd will like."
2870,Chelsea,"Our core is still 4 years out from their prime LMAO It's a double edged sword tho. If we fail to get top 4 this season, the real good talents like palmer, levi, caicedo, gusto, nico wouldn't wanna waste yrs on a ""project"" that keeps getting postponed yr after yr."
2871,Chelsea,Anselmino and kendry paez also 
2872,Chelsea,"Only chose players ≤ 25 yes, because that was their point. We have a lot of players < 26"
2873,Chelsea,"""guiu"" lmao He's 18. I think he can develop into a useful asset."
2874,Chelsea,"Some of the Chelsea youth centric accounts on twitter are so unbearably toxic it's exhausting. Anything short of starting an entire 11 of youth graduates in the prem is considered not good enough for some of them. It's not only that, recently he started to portray himself as some kind of tactic guru claiming advanced tactics and concepts are bullsh*t"
2875,Chelsea,"Felix Johnston usually has good coverage, I’m fairly certain every single person on earth is blocked by that melt Chelsea youth "
2876,Chelsea,Yh wish we faced them in Dec rather than 1st game of season 
2877,Chelsea,That was a different city though. In fact they were the only unbeaten epl team for a few months there. 
2878,Chelsea,"Pls not that 70 fkin million pricetag again and I'm into that Guehi purchase. If he was £35m with our sell on as well making him like £28m 

That'd be great"
2879,Chelsea,"I’d rather us splash on Branthwaite than Guehi tbh, Flamingo would be a great signing but I doubt we get him coz I see us definitely buying Araujo Bro said branthwaite 😭

Why do people rate him at all?"
2880,Chelsea,"I get the point of it (and admittedly don't have a fool proof better system in mind), but unless you get every ticket available up to and including October, which is a ball ache of a task in itself, then membership from that point onwards becomes pretty useless.

Think the most stupid part of it all is that you don't get rewarded with points by buying on the exchange Hate that after all the effort of refreshing 100 times to get a ticket you don’t get the points. Damn really? Smh"
2881,Chelsea,Depends on how deep we run into conference league. Which should be very deep
2882,Chelsea,Why? What's breaking? We are leading the race for Gyokeres according to them. This is so important. We need another striker.
2883,Chelsea,"Portuguese media waffle more than any other media it's unbearable. And then some sporting/benfica/porto fan will come and explain what media is good for what club, and that they are *only* good for that club and lie about everything else, but they all just lie regardless.

I'm so thoroughly burned out from the Ugarte saga lol "
2884,Chelsea,Explain? that we are leading for signing Gyokeres and willing to put 90m in January and also loan them back the rest of the season.
2885,Chelsea,Fairly sure Rory doesn’t have our interests at heart. He’s just there to spew shit for views. 
2886,Chelsea,Few things gets more interactions than someone claiming to be a fan and then shitting on their own club. Rival fans love that. 
2887,Chelsea,i’ve literally never seen that angry little goblin have a remotely good take 
2888,Chelsea,"But he's right. Clearlake have gutted the club of it's identity and betrayed the club's supporters and we aren't even better than last season. We could have kept Pochettino, Chalobah, and Gallagher while integrating Josh Acheampong and maintained the form we ended with last season and the fans would be happier with the state of the club. username and account age checks out Gallagher is someone we ain’t missing, Chalobah has already made more mistakes led to a goal than any other palace player and Petrovic gets overrated when he used let in some weak goals as well, I’m sure you’d love being 10th still with the “identity “ still in tact with average players like chalobah and Gallagher. We lost players like Livramento under Roman who’s levels above those guys You forgot to put /s"
2889,Chelsea,"The goal last week is not something I thought Jackson had in his bag. It was sick It was something I have always wanted to see from Jackson. Bear in mind that Wout Faes is an extremely budgeted David Luiz but it is still good to see. Tbf it was a defensive disasterclass, but props to nico for not letting up and keeping up the press Me too, it caught me by surprise. The two areas I would like to see Jackson improve on are-

Stop getting stupid yellow cards for dissent

Stop getting caught offside so often 

If he can clean up on those two departments... 🤌"
2890,Chelsea,"We still need a striker to challenge Jackson. Duran would literally be perfect. Someone to come off the bench and win aerial duels and bully the defense. Yes Duran/same would have been ideal but with samu on a 100m euro release clause and duran signing a new contract both seem very unlikely. I see delap as being a good potential striker behind jackson, he'll be cheap if ipswich are relegated."
2891,Chelsea,"Yeah new CB and GK can do wonders for us, i know this might be far fetched but I think buying Christensen could do wonders for us considering he can play the inverted CB role. This could help us playing Felix/Enzo as a proper 8 alongside Palmer. Idk but genuine question. Will christensen fit well in a back 4 in the epl? His good performances for us only came in a back 3 iirc. Quick, someone photoshop Christensen in a Chelsea kit Really irritates me people would welcome back a rat like Christensen. He left on a free with offers on the table. Fuck him"
2892,Chelsea,"Look into Fatawu and Mavididi last season under Leicester and revisit this 

Both in a title winning Leicester side had a similar G+A per 90 compared to Noni (and Neto) right now, as well as in xG/xA per 90 if we want to consider luck as a factor 

The issue with the Salah comparison is that he is given 20x more freedom (this year especially, it's out of necessity) to be a primary goal threat. He's an inside forward. (Somewhat irrelevant but its also why hazard vs salah debates are so fucking annoying to me) You should be comparing Noni to actual touchline wingers. Doku and Savinho would be perfect examples of the ""standard"", as they have genuinely ridiculous dribbling stats but their G/A isn't very impressive. They're testaments to how they're both some of the best wingers in the league without being goal threats Don’t look at passing and crossing numbers if you want to act like Madueke plays similarly to Doku and Savinho [Madueke's heatmap for the season](https://i.gyazo.com/8db48e4467fed39f9a8e8d7ee0e500f6.png)


[Salah's heatmap for the season](https://i.gyazo.com/03ffd12dffecc7347b664c058c31bb6e.png)


They are very similar, and playing very similar roles. Obviously again - Salah is the best player in the league so I am not saying he should score and assist *as much* as Salah, but his output despite getting to start week in week out has been atrocious.


E: If we also look at shots/90 data Madueke is taking 3.65 shots per 90 and Salah is only taking 3.16 shots per 90, which further shows this 'touchline winger' narrative is nonsense and Madueke simply needs to step up or be benched/replaced.


Doku takes 2.21 Shots/90 and Savinho 2.55/90 for further comparison Madueke would have surely been given more freedom if his decision-making and creativity were better, no?

Also, calling him a touchline winger when he takes a bajillion shots per game seems misguided. If he's a touchline winger, someone should tell him that."
2893,Chelsea,"It’s funny how he’s finally started to track back and now people are acting like he’s some defensive stalwart that must play for balance reason If none of the other wingers are scoring and/or assisting, which they don’t, then it makes sense to play the one who at least does a bit of tracking back to make up for low offensive output. Noni does the bare minimum, but it’s still more than the other options for that position."
2894,Chelsea,"Madueke simply isn't good enough, no way should he be starting if neto and sancho are fit. "
2895,Chelsea,"All he can bring to the table is hope that we can even break even on him. 

 Haphazard how such a flawed player has such an ego. I'd be dreaming we sold him in January and gave his chances to Tyrique George instead. He might not be the better player yet, but at least he doesn't act like an idiot, can improve, and at worst we can just use Neto RW and Sancho LW. "
2896,Chelsea,You’re probably right but TBH Mudryk might be a great players to start against Villa with that stupid high line they play. Neto and Mudryk running in behind could be deadly against those guys. 
2897,Chelsea,"[deleted] Compared to the other teams we’ve faced, they are the “best” so far Me too. I want sancho and neto starting in the prem."
2898,Chelsea,"If he gets fooled by Bayern after what they’ve done to young players just like him I will be shocked. He has a pathway here because of the unreliable nature of Reece and Gusto also being quite injury prone, there’s a pathway there maybe he just don’t rate himself high enough to prove it. I agree with the sentiment, you need to back yourself to beat the guys in front. 

But still... being behind Reece and Gusto in terms of talent is not a situation anyone wants to be in. I can sympathize with his reasoning, no need to question his mentality. And sure he can look at their injury history and see a *clear* pathway, but if we get them even remotely healthy he's suddenly far back through no fault of his own. Meh, I understand him doing the best for himself. Still really want him to do that at Chelsea. They can easily just point to musiala as a example"
2899,Chelsea,"He has to look at the James situation and fancy his chances of getting minutes this season. No reason why he can’t force himself into the B team.

Sounds to me like his agent is chasing the £££ "
2900,Chelsea,The standoff is doubly annoying when you consider that the ECL is pretty much a perfect stage to start integrating him and that James is James. 
2901,Chelsea,">Losing him on a free is something they really want to avoid.

Realistically, how much is he even worth? At 18 with 37 minutes of first team football, I don't really see any value in him from a transfer fee. Sure he has a lot of promise, but he's at least 3-5 seasons away from really competing for a starting spot in a top club, and that's with him making leaps in his development through those years. I get that we want to keep our academy players in house, but if he's not signing a contract there's not much we can do. We've shown that we won't break our wage structure for even proven players, so it's really on him to decide if what we're offering is enough. "
2902,Chelsea,he’s got someone whispering in his ear about money because his pathway here is the same as any of the teams he’s linked with lmao. if he wants to play hardball then i have no problem with the board playing hardball back. 
2903,Chelsea,Madrid have like 2 and a half healthy defenders. I can’t see a single scenario in which they sell Rudiger. 
2904,Chelsea,"Do you think Maresca will put him in the B team? Depends if Neto will be available Sunday. But if he is, I feel Neto will start at RW and Felix at LW/left no.10. 

So then, Noni won't have a place. That's why I feel he will be moved to the Heidenheim lineup."
2905,Chelsea,"I’d like to see Guiu up front with Sancho, Nkunku, and Madueke behind. "
2906,Chelsea,Massively overrated here 
2907,Chelsea,"Tbf the CB market is pretty dry atm. He’s proven at this level, he’s a starter for England, he’s got experience as a captain and he’s ex Cobham. He’d automatically be in competition for a starting spot with Fofana or Colwill. We could do a lot worse than binning off Tosin, Disasi or Badiashile and bringing him in. ex cobham means absolutely nothing to me if I don’t rate them highly. The guys a decent at best cb, defensively his awareness and positioning can be poor and he’s good on the ball well so is Badia. We should be trying to massively improve on our cbs not just upping the level slightly"
2908,Chelsea,"There are Guehi links?? If so, I’m on the contrary excited af, I’ve been begging for his return for ages Up your standards he’s not that good"
2909,Chelsea,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cgbZqR2AGI 
2910,Chelsea,Honestly the fact we conned arsenal into paying some of his wages is a huge win. Expecting them to be dumb enough to spend actual money on him too would be too much to ask for 
2911,Chelsea,"Probably not. Also Disasi never played under him and the description of him in that article is interesting. Where are these 'decent performances' they speak of? Liverpool in the cup and on opening day, the 1-1 vs City, both Fulham games. If you’re not asking him to play an aggressive high line his pace isn’t a big issue."
2912,Chelsea,Leicester fans dislike Chilwell so I doubt that’d happen 
2913,Chelsea,"He's gotta sign a contract first. We'll keep rotating Gusto, Fofana, and Disasi there until he does.

Edit: Just catching up on the recent talks about a contract. I'm real surprised he hasn't realized that he'd be #2 behind Gusto. Reece hasn't been reliable for a few seasons now so he'd be getting tons of playing time if he develops like he expects to. His agent seems to be shopping around. He probably hasn’t realised or doesn’t believe he’s behind Gusto because when James and Gusto were both out, we decided to play fucking Disasi at RB instead of him. Not exactly doing much to show him a pathway."
2914,Chelsea,he’s following in money mases footsteps and chasing the bag 
2915,Chelsea,"Acheampong probably wants the bag 


You don't look at clubs like Real Madrid, Bayern, Liverpool etc etc and think there's my pathway 



Especially when you're at a club that has only one right back in Gusto who's barely older than you and Reece James who at this point is potentially legally recognizable as a part time member of Chelsea football club Yeah definitely feels that way Yes you do if they lay it out. We’ve had multiple chances to make him believe that he’d have a better pathway here, but chose to play a clunky CB out of position over him multiple times. We haven’t given him any reason at all to believe he’s got more of a chance to play for us than he would get at any of those other clubs. 

But sure, make up that he’s doing it for the money."
2916,Chelsea,"lol no we don't celebrate thanksgiving I don't mean celebrate like it's Christmas, but I saw a surprising amount of thanksgiving meal and gathering ads from pubs and restaurants for it 🤷‍♂️"

2919,Chelsea,"God who pissed in everyone's cornflakes?? 

We're 3rd with a great run of fixtures coming up. Against Leicester we were super solid. Could have had more. Never looked like losing or even drawing really. Even with the last minute pen. 

Miserable cunts in this sub man. Glad I don't know any of you personally. the match thread was filled with overreacting to a point of absurdity, we damn near cruised for most of the match (which is admittedly an issue, we could’ve ended the game in the first half)

but i swear some people on here could win the lotto and ask why they don’t have as much money as Bill Gates lmaooo The people who went all in on hating litterally everything this team has done post Roman have to keep up the illusion that everything is crumbling and that the clubs demise is imminent.

2957,Chelsea,"Absolutely wrote him off. I was wrong. Exactly the energy we need at times. It's easy to criticise something but it's very hard to accept you were wrong.

So well-done to you. A lot of us did. A real sliding door moment for us as a club is playing Cucu in that random league cup game when he was about to go to United Yes, and we weren't wrong to, his form was absolutely atrocious. Given how he has turned it around, it must have been some kind of mental block, as he simply doesn't make the same mistake - one that he used to make 3-4 times every game with the missed interceptions. His tenacity is exceptional and he even gets a bit involved with our attacks now.

I'm really happy to have been wrong about him. I just wish Sanchez could make the same leap now. Absolutely same Most of us did so don’t feel bad"
2958,Chelsea,"What a turn around for him.
One of our most disrespected player since he came to Chelsea. Got lots of abuse from our own fan base.

Very few fans stuck with him and once our managers figured out how to use him he never looked back.


Now he is in the category of Azpi where he keeps giving 7/10 in every game.
Even after the euro games some still don't want to accept it but he is one of the best LB in the world atm.

And now people start seeing he is decent going forward too his crossing is lot better then what he is giving credit for.

For all that some of our fans who disrespected him still not accepting that there were wrong about him.
Instead of apologising they don't even mention his name so they don't have to talk about him. Same goes for all recruitment in general. On an average the recruitment has been fantastic, be it value buys of Jackson, Gusto, Noni or opportunistic deals of Palmer, Sancho, Felix or early lock-ins of Santos, Estevao, Paez. I do not even need to mention Caicedo, Cucurella, Enzo, Lavia. There is enough good work done to last nearly a decade but you will hear some negative pricks harp on about Disasi, Badiashile and Sanchez for infinity and keep meme-crying about ‘pure profit’ as if previous SDs and owners didnt give a rat’s ass about good business and kept every academy prospect locked in forever. 

This negative part of Chelsea fan base needs to open their eyes and realise a lot of their ‘criticism’ is more biased than it needs to be and appreciate the good work done.  The more they're hated, the more I root for them. Glad we didn't sell him for United. He doesn't stop trying, he gives it all. Plus he looks fun in the videos we get to see, pleasant in a work environment. I once had a poodle, but he was a terrier.  A poodle-terrier. A Perrier , or Poodier if you will. Very well behaved usually but I took him to the park and he chased a ducks relentless for an hour. Wouldn’t listen to my calls and just ducked right off. Cucurella reminds me of my dear Poodie. I mean fans should be allowed to criticise players no? I haven't been as critical of cucurella as some fans have but there are still some players who looks like they need guidance to run in the right direction in the squad."
2959,Chelsea,"I was 100% wrong about Marc. I kept reading people talking about the home invasion and the adjustment period and I wasn't sure how it could mean he was playing so bad. Guilty of not seeing the human side of this, and glad to see him killing it. "
2960,Chelsea,"I got constantly criticised for saying patience was needed. Told its Chelsea and no such thing. 

Let these players breathe and settle in. 

Our scouting is top notch. You can’t expect players to come into something so unsettled and with so much change and fire on all cylinders at once. Look at City and the disruptions going on over there and how it’s impacted them. 

We’ve got great people evaluating talents and we seem to rarely miss these days. Exciting times ahead and a far more sustainable model being built than what we had under Roman. True but unless these owners bring the same amount of trophies as Roman he’ll always be the goat Patience and Chelsea never get along since most of us have been used to changing players and managers when it doesn't work.

We finished 12th yet he was the one who got the most abused forgetting that club was just sold to new owners our CL winning manager was sacked loads of players were already looking for new clubs.

We changed so much and so fast and that was the reason the environment became so toxic and players felt that way too.

It went so far ahead were Caicedo have to tells us it's easy to play away games then home games."
2961,Chelsea,"His turnaround is unbelievable. When he is defending 1:1, I have full faith that he won’t be beaten. And his energy is ridiculous. Lung busting runs in the 95th minute "
2962,Chelsea,"Cucurella also said in the mixed zone on Reece James: ""We are very sad. It's tough. He's fit again then has a small injury. We know he's very important for us, he's our captain. He will work hard and can be with us again very soon."" "
2963,Chelsea,"This guy has been immense. Runs end to end, makes tackles, delivers crosses, provides shithousery, and has great hair. He feels like the LB Kante at times I swear, always backed him"
2964,Chelsea,"Cucurella and co, are not only playing like the players we knew they could be but are actually getting better. Like his crossing was never anything to write home about but it’s starting to become an asset. Even Nico will drop into the midfield and hold up play and move the ball, before he was just used to run behind to create spaces (which he still does). I think this very young team is growing and that’s exciting, so huge props to maresca "
2965,Chelsea,I don't know about you guys but this humble pie is quite good 
2966,Chelsea,"Our new Paulo Ferreira, or even Azpi. Consistent 7/10 every game. Well Cucu needs to be consistently consistent lol. Exactly what I was thinking. New Azpi. Very much needed."
2967,Chelsea,He’s proven me wrong and I’m genuinely happy for him. He should be an example to other out of form/struggling players that shit ain’t over till you give up on yourself. I’ve got my fingers crossed for Badiashile.  He played well against Leicester.
2968,Chelsea,"Believed in him since his performance at Brighton vs Man United where he did everything and scored. I knew what kinda player we signed. i’m so so so so happy it’s working out for him, he’s immense. "
2969,Chelsea,"Gary Neville needs to publicly apologise for what he said about Cucu at the Euros

People never watched this guy properly. Even when he was the scapegoat he won 95% of his duels and every goal that went in people would blame him even if it was the CB pairing all over the place.

So glad Cucu and Nico proving reactionary armchair fans wrong Yep our 2nd most consistent player for awhile now. Him and Caicedo set the standards of consistency, workrate and mentality that helped forge this club"
2970,Chelsea,"Happy for Cucu. The turnaround from him has been excellent and rightly so, he is being given just praise currently. Long may it continue. "
2971,Chelsea,I knew he was the real deal when everybody started clowning him after the euros 
2972,Chelsea,"Can't speak for others, but I always had a soft spot for Marc. You could tell he was giving it his all even when we were having a tough time. Plus, I always rated him when watching him at Brighton, so I knew we had a top quality player.

Was surprised that he didn't hit the ground running, but now he's showing his true quality on a consistent basis. "
2973,Chelsea,Never once doubted him 
2974,Chelsea,"He has humbled me, really am happy for him. "
2975,Chelsea,"Cucu always got the worst hate when times were hard, I know i wasn't one of those people "
2976,Chelsea,"It is a long way but he really turned it around

I admit I was wrong, sorry Cucurella "
2977,Chelsea,I hope people here still support our mistake prone players like Sanchez and others. I'm praying for them for a comeback similar to Cucu as well.  
2978,Chelsea,I love Cucu man. Hope he’s a Blue for a long time. 
2979,Chelsea,This player is proof you don't give up on a new signing after one season 
2980,Chelsea,"He’s such a good player, so hardworking and he almost never gets beaten by any attacker he faces, reminds me a lot of Ashley Cole in how difficult he is to beat.

In years to come opposition players are going to start referring to Cucurella as the most difficult opponent they’ve faced. "
2981,Chelsea,Love him. Long may it continue. I actually think he’s become one of the emotional leaders of the team. He’s very consistent now. 
2982,Chelsea,My guy always cooking for the badge 
2983,Chelsea,"The quality and potential has always been there coming through the La Masia academy. He had very good spells at Eibar and Gefate during his first few seasons as a regular pro in his teenage years. 

The move to the PL couple of seasons ago definitely showed how good he is, and I remember he was excellent against us, also one of the standout LBs that season as well. "
2984,Chelsea,I was 100% wrong about him. He’s emerging as a leader and a key player for us and I’m delighted for him. 
2985,Chelsea,"Never wrote him off. Knew he was a special signing from the beginning. A lot of people lack ball knowledge 

And that's ok... "
2986,Chelsea,“HIS HAIR IS FUCKING MASSIVE!!” 
2987,Chelsea,"Maybe it’s the hair, but he seemed to be in every camera shot on tv. "
2988,Chelsea,What a turn around for him and Jackson man. This is why I know mudy gonna come good too. 
2989,Chelsea,"I wasn’t convinced when he arrived, or as we were approaching the end of that transfer window where he was linked to Man Utd, but am so glad to be proven wrong. He’s the vibe we need, and a real character. "
2990,Chelsea,Takes a year or so to settle. Look at when players were signed and when they start playing well. 
2991,Chelsea,"It's easy to criticise something but it's very hard to accept you were wrong.

So well-done to you. Hopefully I can say the same about mudryk. I'm seeing some positive signs."
2992,Chelsea,A lot of us did. A real sliding door moment for us as a club is playing Cucu in that random league cup game when he was about to go to United 
2993,Chelsea,"Yes, and we weren't wrong to, his form was absolutely atrocious. Given how he has turned it around, it must have been some kind of mental block, as he simply doesn't make the same mistake - one that he used to make 3-4 times every game with the missed interceptions. His tenacity is exceptional and he even gets a bit involved with our attacks now.

I'm really happy to have been wrong about him. I just wish Sanchez could make the same leap now. You are definitely overstating it, he had a few poor games like near enough everyone else that season. He was just the scapegoat, associated with Brighton and potter. Same as Sarri and Jorginho. 

And same way people get on guys like Sanchez and Enzo’s back this season when they perform fine (like your comment). Fofana and colwill have made just as many errors leading to goals as Sanchez but you barely hear a thing, especially colwill who has played about 3 goals onside by not keeping his line, but hey, academy boys can’t do any wrong He had a huge pricetag for a left back which added a lot of pressure. And due to the hightened pressure and scrutiny, he had a few poor games and the fans/media started jumping on his back, which made him lose confidence for a period. But he’s clearly a mentally strong guy and he pushed himself out of that, made the Spanish Euro squad and heavily contributed to his country winning that trophy. Now he’s showing similar form for us."
2994,Chelsea,Absolutely same 
2995,Chelsea,Most of us did so don’t feel bad I didn't. Makes me feel vindicated. Now all I want is for Misha and Wes to come good too.
2996,Chelsea,"Same goes for all recruitment in general. On an average the recruitment has been fantastic, be it value buys of Jackson, Gusto, Noni or opportunistic deals of Palmer, Sancho, Felix or early lock-ins of Santos, Estevao, Paez. I do not even need to mention Caicedo, Cucurella, Enzo, Lavia. There is enough good work done to last nearly a decade but you will hear some negative pricks harp on about Disasi, Badiashile and Sanchez for infinity and keep meme-crying about ‘pure profit’ as if previous SDs and owners didnt give a rat’s ass about good business and kept every academy prospect locked in forever. 

This negative part of Chelsea fan base needs to open their eyes and realise a lot of their ‘criticism’ is more biased than it needs to be and appreciate the good work done.  Even forgot about Pedro Neto! Recruitment has been good.
But not great when you look at how we still need a GK after buying so many GK.

We still need a backup CF too also think we should have signed a better winger then going for both Felix and Sancho.

As for Mudryk I still think there is a great player in him but he doesn't involve as much as he should so buying him for me is still was a bad idea.

I would have gone for someone like Leao even if it means  he would have cost us 80 to 100M.

I also didn't wanted us to sign Lavia (nothing against him) since we already have Enzo and Caicedo both are great in possession I wanted us to sign Onana a big tall physical profile who could have offered us something different.


For a CF I think board knew that we need something different to what we have so they went for omordion who was tall physical and excellent young CF.

There are few other misses too but you can't go 100/100 . [deleted] The problem is that despite the massive talent we have we just need some braindead thinking by either disasi, badiashile or wait for it…sanchez to ruin it all."
2997,Chelsea,"The more they're hated, the more I root for them. Glad we didn't sell him for United. He doesn't stop trying, he gives it all. Plus he looks fun in the videos we get to see, pleasant in a work environment. "
2998,Chelsea,"I once had a poodle, but he was a terrier.  A poodle-terrier. A Perrier , or Poodier if you will. Very well behaved usually but I took him to the park and he chased a ducks relentless for an hour. Wouldn’t listen to my calls and just ducked right off. Cucurella reminds me of my dear Poodie. "
2999,Chelsea,I mean fans should be allowed to criticise players no? I haven't been as critical of cucurella as some fans have but there are still some players who looks like they need guidance to run in the right direction in the squad. 
3000,Chelsea,"True but unless these owners bring the same amount of trophies as Roman he’ll always be the goat Trophies are definitely the end game, but a club at the end of the day loves or dies by its recruitment, if you consistently buy shit players you are not winning anything. 

The fact that we have moved on from fascination with names(which got us the likes of Lukaku) and are looking for actual tangible output on the pitch with data and good scouting is a massive step in the right direction. 

That's not to say that there haven't been missteps. 
For instance we really could've done with battering ram of a striker instead of the plethora of 10s or second strikers we have. I’ve never said otherwise. But completely changing how we operate and build was never going to happen overnight. 

One came in guns blazing. Another is a slow build."
3001,Chelsea,"Patience and Chelsea never get along since most of us have been used to changing players and managers when it doesn't work.

We finished 12th yet he was the one who got the most abused forgetting that club was just sold to new owners our CL winning manager was sacked loads of players were already looking for new clubs.

 themselves. We have to trust the recruitment at this point."
3012,Chelsea,[deleted] Both Noni and Felix can be sold for more than what we bought them for so they are definitely good business even if they aren’t providing much to the team
3013,Chelsea,"The problem is that despite the massive talent we have we just need some braindead thinking by either disasi, badiashile or wait for it…sanchez to ruin it all. So you are saying the problem is the team isnt perfect? Insightful! Yeah, don't settle for less"

Many fans are still stuck in the old way, they're only attracted to big names. Look at the Osimhen fiasco - many so-called 'fans' fell out after the owner decided not to sign him. Some people even discredited Jackson, saying that he could never be our main striker, just because they preferred Osimhen."

3016,Chelsea,"Okay jorginho was simply just not good tbh Yep only won multiple trophies including a champions league (dominating every midfield along the way) and came 3rd in the ballon d’or, but yeh he definitely wasn’t that good.

3026,Chelsea,"Ik we talk about this challenge but Felix was a jump away from a broken leg by that scrub soumare. Thankfully he managed to get away from it but that was almost worse than the foul on Cole Every Leicester player was pure filth. Dirty and unprofessional. No sense of care for their opponent at all. Yeah the speed soumare came in with was malicious The intent was so malicious. It’s crazy, it’s like Martinez all over again. We did the same to Odegaard especially at the start of the arsenal game"
3027,Chelsea,"Not only did the ref see the foul on the pitch and decide yellow, the ref on VAR agreed with it so confidently that he didn’t even recommend sending the on field ref to the monitor. At what point is there accountability for utter unprofessionalism and incompetence??? Zero accountability. PGMOL is a good old boys club. The on pitch refs and VAR refs rotate responsibilities. They will always protect each other. I’ve been saying this for years now but VAR needs to be run by an independent organization for it to actually work. stop being a prick mate, they were doing coke at that moment in the VAR room so they couldn't check. have some empathy.

smh people just piling on poor PIGMOL when all they want to do is get rich and do drugs in Thailand Both Refs should have to take the same foul on their Achilles before being allowed to ref another game. Oh come off it, this is the first red card challenge that hasn’t been called despite VAR review on Palmer specifically in….. *checks* *notes* 2 game weeks"

In a way it’s a compliment because it happened to Hazard as well but you’d still prefer your star player to not get the shit stomped out of them. "
3029,Chelsea,"I'm all for full blooded tackles but that's reckless 😐

Gamble responsibly"
3030,Chelsea,Yikes 
3031,Chelsea,"Red all day long, completely through the back of him, and absolutely miles from the ball. Obviously a dirty tactic to try to take Palmer out of the game, didn’t work though! "
3032,Chelsea,They're all out to get him this season... giving him the Hazard treatment 
3033,Chelsea,"Honestly forget giving a red in the moment. Thats the least of my worries atm

Surely they should try retrospectively suspending players for shit like this after the game?

If the ref and VAR can't catch it for the sake of a fair result, ok whatever. But can we at least try to protect the health of the league's most talented players? *All players. That should be a red whoever it is against. I would call for this to be a red if it was Caicedo or Enzo committing this foul on the most unknown development squad player."
3034,Chelsea,That’s mad

Groundie I love you"
3079,Crystal Palace,Fuck this 
3080,Crystal Palace,Im confused but I support it 
3081,Crystal Palace,dog meme 
3082,Crystal Palace,"I'm old too, I'm pretty sure it's a shit Peppa pig "
3083,Crystal Palace,Just a chill guy 
3084,Crystal Palace,"My post about Neokas having had arms up a cows arse also got removed. Mods have way too much power here

Groundie I love you "
3085,Crystal Palace,"I hate takeover speculation. 

We got basically the same “update” three weeks back. No one has any idea what’s going on until it’s all agreed and announced.  "
3086,Crystal Palace,"the fuck is this shit?

No fucking thanks. "
3087,Crystal Palace,Naaaah. Fuck. That. 
3088,Crystal Palace,The match is at 3pm so no UK channels will show unfortunately. 
3089,Crystal Palace,"I hope this is true, I still have faith/hope in glasner "
3090,Crystal Palace,Get Phil Forbin in 
3091,Crystal Palace,"I swear to go if we touch Anthony I’m going to jump off a train into a woodchipper. Mentioning him in the same sentence as us enough to send someone insane, don’t start a bloody transfer rumour about him, I can’t take it. Mate you could probably use a bit of resilience"
3092,Crystal Palace,"very much needed. ideally we get a midfielder or two, and a creator I swear to god if we don't get competition for Mitchell in this or the next transfer window I'm going to scream."
3093,Crystal Palace,Glasner was asked in the press conference before the Villa game if they’d had discussions about January and his reply and demeanor was very positive so I’d expect this to be true. 
3094,Crystal Palace,I'm not as high on Glasner as other fans but I definitely think he deserves to be backed this January. 
3095,Crystal Palace,That strikes me as an article with zero foundation or substance. 
3096,Crystal Palace,"Obviously need some cover on the wings.

I doubt they’ll let him go but I’d love it if Palace managed to get Romain Esse from them up the road. 

One, because I think he’s a great player and two, because they would be a different kind of raging. Got a few mates that are Millwall and none of them rate him, then again this same lot said Harry Kane wasn’t that great when they had him so who knows."
3097,Crystal Palace,He was talking about players in for 1st January so any deals are likely to be quite advanced. Doesn't mean we will close the deals but I don't think he wouldn't be that confident if they were not already in the pipe line. Nothing stopping contracts being signed in advance for completion on 1st Jan. 
3098,Crystal Palace,I’m still not on panic mode yet and one reason is I expect January to be big 
3099,Crystal Palace,I'd rather support Charlton than have Anthony. Just the thought of it.. 
3100,Crystal Palace,Anthony feels completely opposite to most of Dougie’s recent transfer philosophy. 
3101,Crystal Palace,Either that or the Championship 
3102,Crystal Palace,Mate you could probably use a bit of resilience 
3103,Crystal Palace,"I swear to god if we don't get competition for Mitchell in this or the next transfer window I'm going to scream. We need a replacement, not competition!"
3104,Crystal Palace,"Got a few mates that are Millwall and none of them rate him, then again this same lot said Harry Kane wasn’t that great when they had him so who knows. That’s interesting. 

I live in Catford so plenty of Millwall about and I've heard a lot talking him up.

Like you say, who knows?"
3105,Crystal Palace,"We need a replacement, not competition! No, we do not. To get better quality than Mitchell would frankly take more money than we have, and it would be wasteful given that he is far from the weak link in the team."
3106,Crystal Palace,"That’s interesting. 

I live in Catford so plenty of Millwall about and I've heard a lot talking him up.

Like you say, who knows? Ah! So you're the one who keeps stickering the traffic lights post opposite the big cat! 😂"
3107,Crystal Palace,"No, we do not. To get better quality than Mitchell would frankly take more money than we have, and it would be wasteful given that he is far from the weak link in the team. Mitchell is the new Ayew (scapegoat). Untill he gets injured and then you'll realise how fked we really are"
3108,Crystal Palace,Ah! So you're the one who keeps stickering the traffic lights post opposite the big cat! 😂 
3109,Crystal Palace,Mitchell is the new Ayew (scapegoat). Untill he gets injured and then you'll realise how fked we really are 
3110,Crystal Palace,"Good finish and great assist but should also have scored that late volley too, encouraging signs though "
3111,Crystal Palace,"I actually think he's in our best possible XI. 

--------------Henderson

----Chalobah - Lacroix - Guehi

Munoz -------------------------Mitchell

 ------- Wharton - Doucoure

------- Sarr ------------Eze

-------------Mateta "
3112,Crystal Palace,He’s an absolute baller if he gets to his best for you lot you’ve got a threat on your hands 
3113,Crystal Palace,"The team are starting to gel ... We need a bit of luck.

Weirdly even tho we in the bottom 3, I'm actually not worried for once! "
3114,Crystal Palace,"I think everyone is. Initially when Glasner was like, we had no time to prepare and we were just sort of thrown in it, I was like yeah, but that sounds a bit like an excuse.

Now, seeing is complete at a top level, I mean that first half at Villa vs Everton, Nottingham and that, going to the games especially, it’s a completely different side.

We deserve to be in the relegation zone with our performances don’t get me wrong, but we are now putting out performances, not just aware but the whole team, that can challenge champions league sides. I never would’ve thought we’d be in the relegation zone and comfortable, but here we are. "
3115,Crystal Palace,He’s just so dang fast. 
3116,Crystal Palace,Yes 
3117,Crystal Palace,"I say so, I think that when he came into the team, I felt he was our hope, he helped the attacking play so much, especially against Leicester which was his debut, I think with the injuries we lose the midfield battle a lot, so it's difficult for Sarr to get the ball a lot, but from what I've seen he's got the roof to be a good player for us. I still think from what he showed at Watford that he will be nowhere near terrible for his remainder here. "
3118,Crystal Palace,"It was a mixed performance tbh.

Obviously he scored and his speed did give Villa problems.

But there was a moment in the first half where he was through on goal and looked ready to bury it. But he tried to set up Mateta instead and the chance was gone. I had my head in my hands. 

Sometimes his decision making is weird. I don’t know if it’s a confidence thing or what. He was offside for that chance tbf. But I get what you mean"
3119,Crystal Palace,"Sarr looking good and think he will improve. Lacroix looking really good has made some amazing challenges, although not sure he can ping a ball like Anderson. Unfortunately Mitchell looking like a really weak link- he's a good defender but struggles with passy. Think also we're better without Kamada- can't fault his effort but premier league is probably too tough for him. Also obviously Devenny had great start and great to see Doucoure back. Mateta been awesome without Nketiah. "
3120,Crystal Palace,"Tbh I thought he was still a bit shite apart from the goal, but progress is progress. I’d still swap him for Ayew but hopefully he’s on the right path. We should have both but business is business I suppose"
3121,Crystal Palace,"No. He's good on the counter but his passing was pretty bad. He actually missed an easy assists to Mateta on the Devenny goal, and could not get the weight right on any of his short passes. As soon as we try to play with more possession in attack he'll go back to being poor in that area. "
3122,Crystal Palace,I thought he started off quite well but was absolutely dire against Fulham - played well yesterday though. I think he’ll be decent for us. 
3123,Crystal Palace,Hopefully 
3124,Crystal Palace,He looked good 
3125,Crystal Palace,He was awful against Wolves - so not sure getting better with every game is accurate but he can have a big impact for us definitely. He already has in some earlier games too. His 'Xbig chance creation' has been very good 
3126,Crystal Palace,I wouldn't be surprised if he's crap next game. He's always been hot and cold. The villa game played to his strengths. He's not going to have as much space to run into behind the defenders every game. 
3127,Crystal Palace,He was offside for that chance tbf. But I get what you mean 
3128,Crystal Palace,We should have both but business is business I suppose 
3129,Crystal Palace,I WAS INVESTED IN THE STORY 
3130,Crystal Palace,Song? Stepz-rock
3131,Crystal Palace,Stepz-rock 
3132,Crystal Palace,Hendos proper gassed 😂 
3133,Crystal Palace,Unreal effort from Sarr 
3134,Crystal Palace,"You are doing the lord's work, OP 🙏 "
3135,Crystal Palace,What a good knee slide too 
3136,Crystal Palace,"I don’t support palace. Where did this kid come from? Brought from Airdrieonians in Scotland in 2023, previously he had been with Kilmarnock. Joined the Palace U21 squad and has progressed from there"
3137,Crystal Palace,"Brought from Airdrieonians in Scotland in 2023, previously he had been with Kilmarnock. Joined the Palace U21 squad and has progressed from there "
3138,Crystal Palace,Athletic save. Got one mitt on a really hard shot. 
3139,Crystal Palace,Left hand like a grizzly bear. 
3140,Crystal Palace,Deaaanoooo 
3141,Crystal Palace,"Not complaining in any way, but I believe this means Tielemans is 2 for his last 6 penalty attempts. 

Strange decision from villa to go with him but i’ll take it lol. Dean came up massive, easily one of the best moments of the season. "
3142,Crystal Palace,"After taking a closer look, that pass to Mateta from Guehi was absolutely world class. He recognized a seam through 5 of there players and created the 2 vs 3 in a blink. Awesome stuff from him there. "
3143,Crystal Palace,An honourable point. Respect it. Especially with injury’s etc. Better without Kamada. Always good to see the boys play an entertaining game of football too
3144,Crystal Palace,"We would have all taken a draw before this game. Need to reflect on the mistakes and come out strong for the next one. Dougie, Parish & Co need to pull their finger out their ass and spend wisely in winter transfer period.

Also like to add that Henderson has been unreal this season. The sceptics who didn't rate him are eating up their words. Me included.   I wanted to keep Johnstone Yeah we need some more attacking options and an adequate backup for Mitchell. I’d go out and spend on Doughty. He would be perfect to actually start at this LWB/LM position. Mitchell just doesn’t offer enough going forward and he can’t cross worth a shit I’m not sure he’s been ‘unreal’. He was partly at fault for the Watkins goal and does make costly errors like the Wood and Vardy goals’. His distribution is also substandard. 

Having said that, he was very good yesterday. When he has a good game, Palace have a good chance of getting a result."
3145,Crystal Palace,"Sad to give up the lead late, but happy to come out with a draw against a quality team. "
3146,Crystal Palace,"I went into this game praying for a draw and expecting a loss. That we came out of this with a draw, and feeling like we could have won it all, is a hell of a feeling. We looked far better than in the Fulham game, so let's hope we keep this up now. We might still be in the drop zome thanks to Wolves picking up a win, but things do look to be moving again in the right direction.

And what a performance from Devenny! He may have only played two games for us so far, but he's got something good. Hope we keep him in the first team. We have no choice but to keep him with the injuries and having basically no squad depth"
3147,Crystal Palace,"That was a good point with a depleted squad.

Just hope the idiots don't start with the Glasner out crap again.

Sarr getting a goal was great, Mateta played great & Henderson kept us in it.

The tide will turn - I have faith. "
3148,Crystal Palace,"Great point. Shit ref as usual, I thought Guehi was fouled before the pen and matsen should have gone. Diego Carlos went in knee high too. "
3149,Crystal Palace,"Great play from Palace. Ordinarily this would be as good as a win but with relegation starring down at you, you want more. Still, very positive. Henderson was fantastic. Mateta too. "
3150,Crystal Palace,"Decent point earned. Mateta played brilliantly and was unlucky not to score; Sarr is improving, Hughes was awesome, Henderson was great (especially with the penalty save). But, for me, Lacroix gets MOTM; he made some great challenges and was immense. All round, solid performance with plenty of positives to take away. COYP. Lacroix made some absolutely world class tackles"
3151,Crystal Palace,"Was at AFC Wimbledon today for reasons slightly out of my control. Missed the game and was to scared to look at the scores all day. Scared I'd ruin my day.

Can someone explain how we actually was able to get an away draw against a champions league side with a team that looks like a ward at mayday hospital? They left lots of space in behind for us to hit them on the counter which we did very well thanks to Mateta's hold up play and Sarr's pace. We were pretty solid defensively in our 5-3-2 shape and didn't concede too many chances to worry about. Was a good performance overall but their bench was just on another level to ours, they bring on Duran and we bring on Schlupp"
3152,Crystal Palace,"I’ll respect a point, would love a win soon though please and thank you "
3153,Crystal Palace,Expected an L so will definitely take the draw. Didn't watch but sounded like we put in a fight. 
3154,Crystal Palace,"Happy for Sarr. He's had his issues with finishing, but I feel like fans have been a bit harsh towards him. Glad to see him get some goal involvements "
3155,Crystal Palace,"Went today - great atmosphere from our end which I feel like I've not felt for a while. End of the first half was great especially.


Game wise - more than happy with that, we can clearly make and take chances, felt like we were sitting too deep at the start of the second half and invited the goal. Last 10 minutes were very strange, both sides sat off the ball entirely and I thought that was where we could have taken a stab at the 3 points. Although, I remember we used to load everyone into the box when we were level and it bit us on the arse a few times so playing it safe was a good call. "
3156,Crystal Palace,"Didn't get to catch any of the game today. Anyone able to tell me how Devenny looked? Obviously got his goal but the overall play I think he looked really solid regardless of the goal. Got up and down the pitch, neat and tidy on the ball, composed and always in a good defensive position when we didn’t have the ball. Was sad to see him come off."
3157,Crystal Palace,"Also, Hendo was insane today. The pen save is the obvious shout but there was a 1 on 1 with Watkins in the 1st half and the way he stopped it was outrageous. Certain goal there "
3158,Crystal Palace,With our injuries back and some stronger late game legs we're looking decent 
3159,Crystal Palace,A draw is a good result. I am starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel 
3160,Crystal Palace,"Promising. Good result for the context away to top side and performance figures were decent which it’s important for trend.

Over next 12 games the Wins will seriously be needed to aggregate to a better point position otherwise life will be extremely tough for end of season.

I think this squad has the possibility to produce. "
3161,Crystal Palace,I'm in the US and a fan of CP.  Mostly because they seem to be the underdog of the league.  Tell you give me a couple of reasons why more people especially in the US should be fans of CP? 
3162,Crystal Palace,Always good to see the boys play an entertaining game of football too 100% like that pressing in the 95th minute.
3163,Crystal Palace,Me included.   I wanted to keep Johnstone Same. I didn't see the upgrade but I think Hendo is the guy for the next forever.
3164,Crystal Palace,"Yeah we need some more attacking options and an adequate backup for Mitchell. I’d go out and spend on Doughty. He would be perfect to actually start at this LWB/LM position. Mitchell just doesn’t offer enough going forward and he can’t cross worth a shit He put in a handful of good balls yesterday, one of which Schlupp nearly scored from. 

He’s also got the same amount of assists as Muñoz, who’s had a slow start to this campaign, but nobody is questioning him?! 

Mitchell is a very solid defender and a good trainer. If Palace had a more attacking WB, who neglected his defensive responsibilities, a lot of fans would be calling for TM to be recalled. PVA was a good example of this in-balance. You can’t have it both ways! 

I agree though, TM needs competition at LB."
3165,Crystal Palace,"I’m not sure he’s been ‘unreal’. He was partly at fault for the Watkins goal and does make costly errors like the Wood and Vardy goals’. His distribution is also substandard.

Was a good performance overall but their bench was just on another level to ours, they bring on Duran and we bring on Schlupp Just watched motd. Dacoures pass to sarr for devennys goal is a beauty. Perfect weight. We've missed him. So happy for Devenny. Looks like a dependable player to have in the squad. The academy has struck gold again? Injury crisis does have it's silver linings sometimes."
3169,Crystal Palace,"I think he looked really solid regardless of the goal. Got up and down the pitch, neat and tidy on the ball, composed and always in a good defensive position when we didn’t have the ball. Was sad to see him come off. "
3170,Crystal Palace,100% like that pressing in the 95th minute. 
3171,Crystal Palace,Same. I didn't see the upgrade but I think Hendo is the guy for the next forever. We'll see if he earns his own cafe.

3175,Crystal Palace,OMG LaCroix is an absolute monster What a tackle
3176,Crystal Palace,Maybe Devenny will become a permanent part of the first team even when others return from injury. He can keep kamada out of my team any day of the week
3177,Crystal Palace,"DEVENNY!!!!!!!! That’s a confidence booster for sure, this kid has the potential to do some great things for us!"
3178,Crystal Palace,COME ON THEN 
3179,Crystal Palace,DEANOOOOOOOO HAVE IT!
3180,Crystal Palace,Get in boys!!!! Mateta you beauty of a man 
3181,Crystal Palace,DEVENNYYYYYY 
3182,Crystal Palace,"What. A. Swing. 

Devenny!!! "
3183,Crystal Palace,"Always rated Sarr. 

Jk, great assist from Mateta, and a cool finish. Best possible start. COYP! "
3184,Crystal Palace,WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ONNN 
3185,Crystal Palace,Lacroix caught a different vibe today 🔥🔥🔥 
3186,Crystal Palace,HOLY SHIT WHAT A WAY TO START! 
3187,Crystal Palace,FUCKING SARR! WHAT A START! 
3188,Crystal Palace,I LOVE FOOTBALL I LOVE HENDERSON AND I LOVE DEVENNEY 
3189,Crystal Palace,I fucking love this team 
3190,Crystal Palace,"lol, no hope for Mitchell  "
3191,Crystal Palace,Fucking hellllll. I know offside but you’ve still gotta be getting that in the net 
3192,Crystal Palace,Om fucking god 
3193,Crystal Palace,LETS FUCKLING GOOO 
3194,Crystal Palace,This match is such a rollercoaster lmao. 
3195,Crystal Palace,"Fucking hell, we might actually pull this off.

Also that celebration from Henderson, love it "
3196,Crystal Palace,The hendo knee slide is gonna go down in palace folklore

3199,Crystal Palace,Lesgoooo 
3200,Crystal Palace,DEVENYYYYYYYYYYYYY YOU BEAUTY 
3201,Crystal Palace,I have finally joined the anti Mitchell camp I'm not anti him I just wish we had another option to compete with him. 
3202,Crystal Palace,WHAT A START COME ON LADS!!! 
3203,Crystal Palace,What a way to beat the press! COME ON LADS! 
3204,Crystal Palace,Well I’ll be damned lmao 
3205,Crystal Palace,Ball don’t lie let’s go palace!!! 
3206,Crystal Palace,WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ONNNNN 
3207,Crystal Palace,ICE IN HIS VAAAAINS 
3208,Crystal Palace,"Mateta, Lacroix and Sarr all been great today. Good to see players playing well even when we’re extremely depleted, which historically has not been the case "
3209,Crystal Palace,What a start ! 
3210,Crystal Palace,LETS GOOOOO 
3211,Crystal Palace,"On the train to my pals house to get hammered so missed the goal. 


Please can we get something here boys.  "
3212,Crystal Palace,I think this break has done the boys well! 
3213,Crystal Palace,I’m loving the pressure Definitely playing with more conviction than weeks prior so far
3214,Crystal Palace,"Needed to play mateta through there, Hughes. But I like that we are still looking to score! Keep it up lads! "
3215,Crystal Palace,Where was guehi and lacroix then… too easy Thought the same
3216,Crystal Palace,HOLY SHITTTTT 
3217,Crystal Palace,YEEEEEEEEEEDSSSBSSJSNSSNS. NEVER SEE THE LIKES AGAIN 
3218,Crystal Palace,WHAT THE FUCK 
3219,Crystal Palace,LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
3220,Crystal Palace,Im sorry for ever doubting whether Devenney was up to it 
3221,Crystal Palace,Lacroix has been so good today with the 1v1s 
3222,Crystal Palace,LACROIX 
3223,Crystal Palace,I’ll say it first but I was expecting to easily lose this match like Fulham so I’m happy we got a point from this 
3224,Crystal Palace,"Viaplay multistream in Poland didn't even bother showing the Palace goal, ffs. "
3225,Crystal Palace,what a save 
3226,Crystal Palace,"Mitchell, all you had to do was send it to the big, bald head for an easy header 🤦  "
3227,Crystal Palace,well fuck 
3228,Crystal Palace,Yes deano!!!!! 
3229,Crystal Palace,GET IN DEVENNY!!!!! 
3230,Crystal Palace,LETS FUCKING GO 
3231,Crystal Palace,I’m going to pass away 
3232,Crystal Palace,fuckckck lets gooo 
3233,Crystal Palace,COYP 
3234,Crystal Palace,Such a composed finish 
3235,Crystal Palace,Villa’s penalty taker has missed 4 of 6 tries! And then the counter!!! That’s insanely bad form
3236,Crystal Palace,"I've never had anything bad about Sarr ever ~~(don't check)~~. He's having a great game, fingers crossed he's finally finding his feet "
3237,Crystal Palace,There is another one for us on the break here 
3238,Crystal Palace,Should definitely still be a yellow at least 
3239,Crystal Palace,"A win would have been great, but any point is important.

I like how Doucoure and Devenny were substituted, maybe because we need them to remain injury free, given our current injury list. "
3240,Crystal Palace,"What's going on, do we look good or lucky? "
3241,Crystal Palace,"So we’re just better without Kamada and Nketiah And Eze, and Wharton, and Lerma……apparently."
3242,Crystal Palace,Big save Hendo! 
3243,Crystal Palace,NO WAYYYY 
3244,Crystal Palace,oh my.... 
3245,Crystal Palace,Please lads keep it level to half time 
3246,Crystal Palace,"Bruh it is so easy to get a one on one or a two on two. 


How are there three CBs on here  "
3247,Crystal Palace,"No foul on guehi leading to this terrible PK.
Calls have just not gone our way this half. "
3248,Crystal Palace,Let's fucking go Deano 
3249,Crystal Palace,NAHHHHH AHHAHAHAHAHAA 
3250,Crystal Palace,"I can't watch the match right now but it seems insane from what I read on Sofascore, are we playing well or getting exceedingly lucky? Playing well, Villa is playing worse. Combination of getting lucky, Villa looking quite poor even with a lot of the ball, and some good bits of skill in between I'd say Actually playing really well, great passing, great defensive decisions, smart build up, and vision! Plus Deano making MASSIVE saves."
3251,Crystal Palace,What the actual fuck 
3252,Crystal Palace,"Ahhhh bruvvvvvb




What a game but fuck me  "
3253,Crystal Palace,"Pretty good point all things considered. There is a lack of real quality in the squad that is preventing us from turning these draws into wins, and some of our losses into draws. Hopefully that will be addressed in the transfer window and we don't end up wasting money on mediocrities like Nketiah. "
3254,Crystal Palace,"The PK save followed by the goal was electric. Don’t know what Hughes was complaining about, didn’t have audio, but clear pen. "
3255,Crystal Palace,"Why is the PBP commentator in US calling the game by herself? Lol, there’s two they just have identical voices"
3256,Crystal Palace,Mitchell 🤦‍♂️ 
3257,Crystal Palace,bye bye doucoure again? 
3258,Crystal Palace,Doucoure is made of glass 
3259,Crystal Palace,Ffs 
3260,Crystal Palace,Fuck 
3261,Crystal Palace,Wtf. One pass just completely bypassed our midfield. Wake up palace! 
3262,Crystal Palace,"Fucks sake. We're fucked here. Two minutes is a long time in football, hey?"
3263,Crystal Palace,Oh ffs 
3264,Crystal Palace,Terrible decision don’t get blinded cmon it was clear
3265,Crystal Palace,HAHAHAHAHAHHA 
3266,Crystal Palace,HENDOOO 
3267,Crystal Palace,My fucking guy!! 
3268,Crystal Palace,Feels like a goal 
3269,Crystal Palace,"Not watching but is it time to park the bus Roy style? Or are we playing well enough to stay aggressive? If we park the bus we'll make a mistake and concede. We can kill them on the counter. Get into em park the bus, villa playing dangerously and honestly even idk how we’ve gone up"
3270,Crystal Palace,REF 
3271,Crystal Palace,This is gonna be a long 20 minutes.  
3272,Crystal Palace,Having pacey defenders is such a game changer 
3273,Crystal Palace,Lacroix - beast mode on 
3274,Crystal Palace,Can see the determination in the defence to secure this win. Love it. 
3275,Crystal Palace,I'm scared. This grim.
3276,Crystal Palace,Docoure starting is a big boost but shit man... We're down bad in attacking options It’s like no Eze no attack lol
3277,Crystal Palace,3-5-2??? Doubt it.. glasner is stubborn and we are probably still 3421 with Devaney and sarr as the Cams
3278,Crystal Palace,COYP! 
3279,Crystal Palace,Trying to find a positive…. 
3280,Crystal Palace,I’ll be very surprised if we get a draw 
3281,Crystal Palace,That bench is gash 
3282,Crystal Palace,"Depending on how we line up we could absolutely dominate the midfield but we don’t have much going forward outside of a lucky quick transition break. Certainly not breaking down any disciplined back lines with this though. Let’s at least get that point though, COYP! "
3283,Crystal Palace,"On the bright side, some of our youngsters are given game time. "
3284,Crystal Palace,Two attacking players lol 
3285,Crystal Palace,"We need at least a draw, this squad is capable of that. What? Away at Villa? Our impact subs are....Schlupp maybe? They have Duran and Buendia."
3286,Crystal Palace,This grim. 
3287,Crystal Palace,It’s like no Eze no attack lol 
3288,Crystal Palace,Doubt it.. glasner is stubborn and we are probably still 3421 with Devaney and sarr as the Cams 
3289,Crystal Palace,What? Away at Villa? Our impact subs are....Schlupp maybe? They have Duran and Buendia. I thought Agbinone looked promising when he came on against Fulham. He's got a lot of confidence and drive for a young guy so I hope he gets a look in
3290,Crystal Palace,I thought Agbinone looked promising when he came on against Fulham. He's got a lot of confidence and drive for a young guy so I hope he gets a look in 
3291,Crystal Palace,Think there is a very good chance this will happen given injury to Franca and Kamada poor performances - just depends on what Glasner made of him in preseason 
3292,Crystal Palace,"To be perfectly honest Devenney seems to be plugging the gap pretty well. Also Eze will be back soon and hopefully Sarr can start cooking after a good finish today. They're play in two completely different positions so not sure of the connection lol. Devenney is in midfield, Rak Sakyi is a winger.

I don't think they'll recall Rak Sakyi since he seems to he hitting his stride and getting some good development on loan. But we don't really have too much cover on the RW so who knows."
3293,Crystal Palace,Let him stay for his own development. By the time Jan finishes our injuries should've recovered Agreed. We want players to do well out on loan.
3294,Crystal Palace,We may need him 
3295,Crystal Palace,"Might be in the contract he can’t be, I don’t know. It’s in the contract that he can be"
3296,Crystal Palace,![img](emote|t5_2tqdj|9031) 
3297,Crystal Palace,"I think we should keep him there for the remainder of the season. He's doing well enough in the Championship, however not exactly setting it alight. Another half season of starting every game there rather than a bit part role for us will be better for his development "
3298,Crystal Palace,"They're play in two completely different positions so not sure of the connection lol. Devenney is in midfield, Rak Sakyi is a winger.

I don't think they'll recall Rak Sakyi since he seems to he hitting his stride and getting some good development on loan. But we don't really have too much cover on the RW so who knows. We don't play with wingers at the moment - Devenney has been playing as a 10 on the left side which I assume is similar to what Rak-Sakyi would be playing on the right"
3299,Crystal Palace,Agreed. We want players to do well out on loan. 
3300,Crystal Palace,It’s in the contract that he can be 
3301,Crystal Palace,We don't play with wingers at the moment - Devenney has been playing as a 10 on the left side which I assume is similar to what Rak-Sakyi would be playing on the right 
3302,Crystal Palace,"Sounds like Lerma, Doucoure and Hughesy are all back for today. 

Doubt we’ll get anything against Villa but the break has done us some good so you never know. "
3303,Crystal Palace,I pray Agbinone starts or at least gets a feature! 
3304,Crystal Palace,"Thinking this will end up in a draw,

 also thinking the lads are usually completely useless after an international break, 

hoping they prove me wrong Would gladly take a draw from this."
3305,Crystal Palace,"Big question for me is who starts on the left.

No eze or kamada

Can't see him trusting Agbinone with a start at this stage.

Maybe we go 3-5-2 with lerma Hughes and doucoure.

It can't be schlupp...
Right? It'll be Schlupp left.

B'dum Tish According to Fotmob it is a 3-5-2. Imo that's the ideal formation for this match, gives us a better chance at controlling the midfield."
3306,Crystal Palace,Would gladly take a draw from this.

3312,Crystal Palace,Not headed out - but description reminds me of Townsend goal vs West Brom: https://youtu.be/ZV1k6sNB55M?si=g4MKI70qqERgr2X4 That’s the one that came to mind for me too.
3313,Crystal Palace,Or you maybe mean the goal by Dimitri Oberlin from Fc Basel. The description of the goal matches and the shirts are red and blue aswell Oh my god you’re right it is. Haha i got confused by the red and blue kit but thanks alot
3314,Crystal Palace,Petty sure you’re talking about Bolasies run down the wing but he assists not scores. 
3315,Crystal Palace,That’s the one that came to mind for me too. 
3316,Crystal Palace,Oh my god you’re right it is. Haha i got confused by the red and blue kit but thanks alot Haha glad to help mate😂 who would have thought that my insane knowledge in football would be any helpful
3317,Crystal Palace,Haha glad to help mate😂 who would have thought that my insane knowledge in football would be any helpful 
3318,Crystal Palace,"I'm sure I remember him playing up front for a game for some obscure reason and scoring a hat-trick. Surprised that wasn't mentioned as one of his best memories. that's my 2nd favourite Palace moment of all time (after Wilf's goal in the playoffs) - so I'm shocked it's not his!

Not just any hattrick either, a perfect hattrick in less than 7 minutes, against opposition from the league above us. And he was only playing upfront at all because Warnock's wife had a dream about it the night before! Fourth round replay against Wolves. Went to that game on a whim because I had nothing better to do. What an iconic night. It's great where Palace are now but nothing quite beats the nostalgia of late 2000s, early 2010s Palace."

3326,Crystal Palace,👌😩 
3327,Crystal Palace,I caint believe it 
3328,Crystal Palace,At least there's the new stand being built 
3329,Crystal Palace,The palace attack is bang on. 
3330,Crystal Palace,Best part of the season… 
3331,Crystal Palace,"Sounds like he's doing really well at Exeter too, would love it if he managed to break through here "
3332,Crystal Palace,"Did he say that Guaita failed to show up at the hotel?

I guess he showed himself to be quite unprofessional at the end of his time at palace, but perhaps there was more examples we didn't hear about I don't think he meant it like that - just that he was injured and didn't travel with the team."
3333,Crystal Palace,"I don't think he meant it like that - just that he was injured and didn't travel with the team. Quite possibly. Just sounded like Viera was expecting Guaita, so when he no-showed at the hotel, suddenly Joe was called upon without any prior expectation."
3334,Crystal Palace,"Quite possibly. Just sounded like Viera was expecting Guaita, so when he no-showed at the hotel, suddenly Joe was called upon without any prior expectation. "
3335,Crystal Palace,"A brief glimmer of hope, go 1-0 up to go on and lose 4-1. The most realistic answer 😭😭😭 Unfortunately I would have to agree![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)"
3336,Crystal Palace,hughes back so easy win 
3337,Crystal Palace,Pain This is the correct answer.
3338,Crystal Palace,"Mateta scores 2, nketiah 1 for a glorious 3-1 victory. "
3339,Crystal Palace,An absolute battering. Probably the best we can hope for is to try and kill the game and hold on for a nil nil 
3340,Crystal Palace,3-0 Villa 😭 
3341,Crystal Palace,Ollie’s confidence will be sky high. I’m thinking 2-0. Ollie and Rogers Read this as Olise…
3342,Crystal Palace,Not expecting much tbh. Squad in terms of availability is pretty much at the same place it was for Fulham. Doucoure is probably match fit to start as opposed to making a cameo off the bench so that's one plus. This whole period between now & the window opening is all about trying to dog it out & get by with damage limitation. Try to get to January out of the relegation zone & then reinforce to compensate for the insufficient summer we had in the attack 
3343,Crystal Palace,We lose 
3344,Crystal Palace,L 
3345,Crystal Palace,17% chance we win That high?
3346,Crystal Palace,2-0 loss 
3347,Crystal Palace,Shock the world 
3348,Crystal Palace,"They'll likely take it more seriously than the league cup game we had against them. Ollie will be raring to go after the int'l break.

Still, never say never. We need to at least try and scrape something out of this game. "
3349,Crystal Palace,2-1 loss 
3350,Crystal Palace,Villa 56992-1 
3351,Crystal Palace,We beat them again 
3352,Crystal Palace,There's always hope. We continue to cling to the wreckage. Id be happy with a point 
3353,Crystal Palace,Another loss and another nail in OG's coffin I fear. 
3354,Crystal Palace,The most realistic answer 😭😭😭 
3355,Crystal Palace,Unfortunately I would have to agree![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)

3380,Everton,Zero surprise.  He started changing the club prior to being lured back to the biggest (top 2?) club in the world. I don't hate him for it but it'd be nice to think about what he could have done here with another year or so. Not much when the club gave him Josh King to cement a challenge for the top 4. After being second or third at Christmas. The club is a joke.
3381,Everton,"If he leaves Real Madrid at the end of the season (which he’s speculated to) for Xavi Alonso, I would love him to come to the dugout for the next ground. "
3382,Everton,He's going to walk us into Bramley Moore at the start of next season (a man can dream) 
3383,Everton,"He's don  of us, he's don of us, don Carlo el magnifico "
3384,Everton,I am Evertonian (in the theme of Sparticus). 
3385,Everton,"I want to hate him, but I can't. He's like the ex you couldn't move on from even though they already have another boyfriend. "
3386,Everton,Love Carlo ❤️ 
3387,Everton,"Hala ye Ma, lad "
3388,Everton,COME BACK TO US SWEET PRINCE! PLEAAAASE! He's no Prince. He's a king
3389,Everton,"He sued us. So... I mean, rightfully so. Do some research.  His beef with our incompetent ownership has nothing to do w his admiration for the club. We agreed to settle with him. So…"
3390,Everton,"I'm still torn about Carlo. 


Hes a snake but hes our snake and I don't know how to feel about that.  is he really a snake? i mean it’s Real Madrid and he’s Carlo Ancelotti. if it’s about the suing, he sued our dogshit owners not the club itself"

3392,Everton,"Not much when the club gave him Josh King to cement a challenge for the top 4. After being second or third at Christmas. The club is a joke. Josh King is a hell of a footballer. He scored a hat trick at Goodison!

Wait, what do you mean that was after he left and those were the first goals he scored for Watford? Yep I've always assumed once the true state of the finances became apparent he probably felt pretty fucked over. And who could blame him for leaving when Real fucking Madrid came calling?

He would have been in the same financial situation as FSW that summer had he stayed, with a budget of about a couple million only and the same players otherwise. Moshiri’s worst decision of them all, arguably. We threw away European qualification"

And as a true blue Evertonian, my heart breaks 😭 "
3403,Everton,Brilliant goals 😅🥲 
3404,Everton,"Maybe replace it with a saves compilation, and than there will be a lot. It’s weird. How do teams who have the worst GF AND Best GA (leaving aside first 4 matches) records fare? They perform shit most of the time, the example I recall is Middlesbrough 16/17, they were very tight defensively but with an abysmal attack and got relegated. There’s a reason that a win is 3 points and a draw is only one, the game is made this way to promote trying to score. 
On the other hand, being shit in defense doesn’t mean you will be shit overall, Aston vill got CL despite conceding 61 goals, just because they would score more Teams who cant score goals get relegated."
3405,Everton,Long compilation 
3406,Everton,my favourite was 
3407,Everton,In the Everton supporters world we have to find humour somewhere so thanks for this!!

The fans need to have their expectations dampened due to the finances of the club, we simply can't compete even with the mid-table sides. 12 games in and it's already splintered into those who have invested and those who have not.

Saying that however, we're the longest waiting side in the 92 to experience any tangible achievement. Asking for patience after such a long wait and a massive false dawn in Moshiri's money is too much. Any consistent match-going fanbase would get tired of being asked for patience at this point. What happened? Was it Talksport again?"
3444,Everton,"Evan Ferguson looking for a move. Would he be worth a shot for a loan in Jan? Bonkers to think how quickly things change.

He was the next big thing and now can’t get a look in. > Would he be worth a shot for a loan in Jan?

No domestic spaces left for a loan. We’d have to buy Broja or Harrison first. Would love it but wont happen unless we bought harrison out right. Before people worry about leicester grabbing him… they already have one brighton player on loan."
3445,Everton,"how did Broja do last night for the u21s? could he run with the ball? Also Patterson with the double yellows? What happened? I read that as *""Could he run for a ball""* and thought how far our expectations had dropped. Wasn't streamed anywhere. Seen it was nil nil at half time and he got subbed, Patterson must have been getting skinned, seen he got two yellows"
3446,Everton,"Britpop big 4 ranked? Mines Pulp, Suede, Oasis then Blur "
3447,Everton,"Seen rumors of mcatee being available in january Not to us. Would love that tbh, really impressed me when he was at Sheffield United."
3448,Everton,Trying to get tickets for my family's first match in April (from the States). I've signed up for the membership so now I get the email notifications when matches are released. I saw one today for Chelsea but by the time I clicked the link (just to check prices/availability) it was already sold out. I assume this is normal. Is there an official time when tickets go on sale so I can make sure I don't miss out? 
3449,Everton,City really pulled an Everton tonight. At least we’re not the only team to throw away leads.

You can point to the earned points total of last year but that’s a completely different season to this one. Last season had the ‘us vs the world’ intangible boost and was probably one of the worst seasons in terms of quality. We went 13 games without a win, had a 10 point deduction and still stayed up at a canter.

People say this is the best squad Dyche has had, but it’s a squad that hasn’t had investment yet again. If you’re constantly making money on the playing staff while everyone else is spending around you (Brighton earned the same points but spent £200m in the summer), the gap inevitably gets wider.

This season has seen everyone improve and spend apart from Palace and Wolves and the tables already become separated of those clubs who haven’t spent and those that do.

We should have more points from the games we’ve played but we’d have always finished 15th down because that’s how this league works. It’s been proven that the wage bill is a direct comparison to where teams finish and when you’re slashing yours, you’re not going to get better."

Wolves score too many and have too much to quality from midfield and higher up the pitch while I think Palace just haven’t clicked quite yet but Eze and Mateta can get them out of tight games once they do.

We have zero pace across the pitch, minimal running power, zero goalscorers and zero creativity. The only thing we have is defensive solidity and experience at this level. Southampton are dead and buried, Leicester have a garbage squad and hopefully will butcher their new manager search with Potter and Moyes reportedly wary while Ipswich look a bit sketchy at the back but have a quality manager and a team that can run."

3479,Everton,Hes played his last game of football. But thankfully it is no longer our problem. We’ll always have those 7 seconds of football against Palace which helped us score
3480,Everton,"Of course he has , he's never playing a prem game again. He's finished the quicker he realises this the better I understand why he wants to cling on to any chance of being a PL player again but he really needs to reflect on his situation.  If he won’t go abroad he needs to realize the lower leagues are his only chance to play."
3481,Everton,"Is this man made out of celery Celery is more flexible. No, popadoms."
3482,Everton,"Think his career at these levels is finished. Best thing for him now is to play lower league or just retire and enjoy life. It’s a shame it didn’t work out but I had my doubts that it would anyway. Maybe have a crack at coaching? all being told he has a good football head on him, i believe i read this sonewhere during pre season"
3483,Everton,"After 2 years, are we sure this is really a physical injury? It has been 2 years of constant injuries without playing a professional game. Maybe he is not ready for it mentally, they are giving him time and cover Drug addiction wears the body down he's probably got the body of a 40 year old after all the abuse."
3484,Everton,Gutted for him. Hope he is doing alright mentally. 
3485,Everton,wish him the best 
3486,Everton,He's still here? 
3487,Everton,And people on here were talking about us signing him a few months ago lol 
3488,Everton,"Dang, he might not make that 2026 World Cup team now "
3489,Everton,"I don't even know what to think about Dele anymore. Clearly seems like his window of opportunity has passed. Is there some time limit, or some minimum time requirement that the club has to keep looking after him? I know there is some duty of care if a player gets injured while contracted to a club...but surely that's not infinite and indefinite? What if he never gets fit enough to play professional football again? Do the club just have to endlessly pretend this is still a possibility? I know he's not being paid, but the club is still expending some resources on him if our physios are still looking after him while injured. And when not injured, he's presumably still being given a training jersey, a locker, a parking spot at Finch Farm, etc. I just wonder what the time limit to all of this is, if there is one. 

Surely we can't still be thinking he's on the brink of being fit enough to earn a contract and play in the first team this season. I don't otherwise see the point in keeping him around. "
3490,Everton,"Everton, please give up on the notion that Dele will ever be fit or return to his form. The guy has been injuried for over 18 months now. He is done! "
3491,Everton,🤷🏽‍♂️ 
3492,Everton,Honestly should just go be a pundit or lay low and enjoy life out of the spotlight imo 
3493,Everton,"Like the birds, Dele doesn’t exist "
3494,Everton,He’ll be back in two weeks 
3495,Everton,Poor fella 
3496,Everton,Fuck sake 
3497,Everton,Be a mistake to sign yet another injury prone player. Which means Everton will probably offer him a contract. 
3498,Everton,Shooooockerrrrrr 
3499,Everton,Just meme this already 
3500,Everton,Oh no! Anyway... 
3501,Everton,No harm in letting him use the facilities. Then if there’s even a 10% chance it happens then surely we will get first refusal 
3502,Everton,[deleted] ?
3503,Everton,"We’ll always have those 7 seconds of football against Palace which helped us score He was actually great that game, if my memory serves me right Will always have a soft spot for the guy for that reason alone."

3512,Everton,And more sturdy And tastes lovely with a dash of salt
3513,Everton,And tastes lovely with a dash of salt 
3514,Everton,"Okay, let's play.



Patterson sold or loaned, new RB option in. Doesn't start immediately, then gets one game with some shaky play so Dyche benches him for three weeks before being forced to play him after another injury shifts Ashley Young out of RB. Nailed on from that point forward. 



I feel like O'Brien may also be loaned out and if it happens we will regret the lack of quality depth at CB. Makeshift backline of Keane-Young/Coleman will be our lowest point after January as a starting 11. 



We desperately need a standout attacker in the midfield, striker, or RW position. We'll narrowly miss out on a player who goes to a CL club in the summer, and then sign a ""versatile"" player who prefers the left or 10, and this will ensure one or two of our best three attackers is always played out of position. 



Chermiti and Broja will come back, and share the Beto role of 5-15 minute cameos in games where the rest of the squad has already thrown in the towel and started thinking about what's for dinner. 



DCL will sign a pre contract elsewhere. We'll see him smile for the first time this season the following match. 



Honestly, if we keep Dyche I don't see how else it goes. Maybe we also make Harrison permanent. This is The way Spot on 😂"
3515,Everton,"Even if we find a suitor Dom won't leave, he can just wait 6 months and collect the transfer fee himself. "
3516,Everton,"A lot depends on whether or not the takeover goes through before Christmas or not.

1. Takeover doesn’t go through - we may be offloading players to keep afloat in the short term if we get offers in. In which case strengthening the squad is unlikely

2. Takeover does go through - we shouldn’t need to offload anyone (barring a great offer that we couldn’t really refuse anyway). We may look to get a fullback or something, but I don’t personally see us doing much business at all in the Jan window. "
3517,Everton,hopefully theres at least another 5 senegalese ballers called ndiaye up for grabs If we could clone ndiaye and have him play all midfield and attacking positions I think we'd be in a better spot 😂
3518,Everton,"There is no magic fix, or any fix probably. The best we can hope for is safety, new ownership, and a sparkling new stadium in August. Anyone expecting anything more is just setting themselves up for a let down. Not true at all, Newcastle were dead bottom with a fucking shit squad when the new owner came in and made sensible changes during transfer window, and they ended comfortable midtable"
3519,Everton,Need better than Lindstrom 
3520,Everton,"I do think like last january you will see much less business across the league unlike previous januarys. 

If TFG is in mid december

Probably a new manager by jan 1.

Patterson i think will go and we will bring in a new rb. Maybe a winger as well.

Dom will sign a pre contract with an italian club or something or wait til the summer. He isnt being sold he will go for free "
3521,Everton,This is The way 
3522,Everton,Spot on 😂 
3523,Everton,If we could clone ndiaye and have him play all midfield and attacking positions I think we'd be in a better spot 😂 
3524,Everton,"Not true at all, Newcastle were dead bottom with a fucking shit squad when the new owner came in and made sensible changes during transfer window, and they ended comfortable midtable "
3525,Everton,"To be honest Everton is not the place for a young striker to kick start a slow career. We are very defensive and don't give much, if any service to our strikers.

From what I've seen of Broja I'm not convinced he's much better than Calvert Lewin or Beto and we have Chermiti our own youth player coming back from injury at some point. I would expect Broja to get a few sub appearances and only if he really sets the world alight will he get a spot in the first team. "
3526,Everton,He's not DCL so he won't play 
3527,Everton,"He will probably play and he will be crap because:

1) he might just be crap
2) Dycheball is where attackers go to die "
3528,Everton,"1. He's probably not yet ""Dyche fit""


2. Dyche sees no reason to change as DCL is banging them in. He's hit a massive 2 in 11 games.  Unstoppable by Dyche standards.  "
3529,Everton,"Hopefully he can come in and bang in a few goals, I don’t think he’s going to be a massive threat but compared to DCL and Beto hopefully he can do something "
3530,Everton,"Even if he comes in and scores no goals, he will be just as effective as the rest of our forwards. "
3531,Everton,"The boos around Goodison Park which followed Everton’s goalless draw against 10-player Brentford on Saturday reflected the sense of frustration, anxiety and continued disappointment surrounding the club.

It is a frustration that has plagued all connected with the club for some time now but one that gathers in intensity month by month.

It's a feeling only punctuated by the prospect of an iconic new stadium which has risen majestically along the famous Mersey waterfront and the hope that prospective new owners, The Friedkin Group (TFG), will bring to a punch-drunk fan base and club workforce.

After Saturday's game, there was a quote circulating from one player pointing out the positives that Everton had only lost one of the last eight games. However, the beleaguered Everton fans don't see it as a positive.


They want to see wins, they want to see good performances, goals... and some sign that a club which has hung around the bottom of the Premier League for so long it's in danger of being charged for loitering with intent might start to show progress, rather than the rollercoaster experience they've been subjected to for far too long.

Of course, Sean Dyche is taking the brunt of the criticism. Despite navigating the club through some of the toughest times it has ever had to deal with, he will know you're only as good as your results. While there have been some crucial wins in his time in charge, overall they are not good enough for where this club and its fans want to be.

It's only right to say that Dyche has had to deal with some of the toughest conditions affecting any Everton manager, many not of his own making, and he has often been left to front up on his own. It's also correct to note that he and director of football Kevin Thelwell have been working under strict and often delicate financial restrictions.

However, the fans have had enough. It looks like the goodwill Dyche rightly amassed last season has evaporated. The fans don't agree with his selections or tactics and the dissent is growing game by game.

Dyche's contract is up at the end of this season and there are no talks, no any sign of any negotiations to extend his stay.

That is mainly due to the situation over the ownership, with the expectation of the club changing hands within the next month, I don't expect anything to happen with regards to the management position at least until the new owners are in place.

My understanding is that Dyche has the full backing of current owner Farhad Moshiri and board of directors and he will be in charge for the foreseeable future. Many see the change of ownership as a point where the manager's position will be under severe threat - but from what I understand, there have been no discussions in that regard, or about possible replacements, despite the speculation to the contrary.

Former Brighton and Chelsea boss Graham Potter has been strongly linked with Everton but he's now a favourite for the newly vacant position at Leicester City.

I'm told TFG are fully concentrating on completing the Premier League ownership process and getting their administration positions lined up ahead of a mid-December deal completion.

That news will come as a disappointment to a lot of fans that want to see a change in the dugout, especially with the December fixture list ahead - one which includes all of the current top four, along with a trip to Manchester United and home games against an improving Wolves side and surprise package Nottingham Forest.

To say it's a difficult run is an understatement. Dyche will hope that if his side can take a couple of big scalps in that run, he may settle some of the anxiety.

Of course, the alternative to that would probably see Everton beginning the new year in a perilous position; not what new owners would want, and certainly not what a fan base now battle-hardened to relegation scraps want either.

I have to admit to feeling like a broken record when I say these are crucial times at Everton. There have been so many over the past decade and before, but there is a sense that change is around the corner though it's an uncertain time too.

Evertonians have watched with interest the goings on at TFG's other club, AS Roma. That has left some people questioning how they will adapt to life in the Premier League.

They are two very different scenarios in one sense - but it's fair to say there are also many similarities - however with the new stadium and a fresh set of eyes looking at all areas of this famous old football club, it does seem like this is the opportunity to get it back to a place the fans believe it should be.

It will take time for sure. But if ever there was a fork in the road offering a different path, this is it. That's to come though - the reality is there is still a league campaign ongoing, one which will mark the end of an era at Goodison Park.

The famous old stadium, which has seen an unbroken top flight status for over 70 years, deserves to end it by continuing that record. "
3532,Everton,"No reason to allow Moshiri to pick another manager at this point. Ride with Dyche until the new owners/board are in place. By the January transfer window, Everton will likely be in relegation zone. But, the club will also have a new owner/board and some cash. Still, the squad is average, depth is non-existent and the cash that’s available will be limited by profitability rules. So-it’s not likely a miracle happens. I expect we will see a new manager and one or two new players. They will lift the team to 14th or 15th position by year end and the new era can really begin at BMD. "
3533,Everton,"We've lost 1 of our last 8 league games and have only conceded 4 goals, with no more than 1 in a game. Sure, things could be better but they could also be a hell of a lot worse. Yeh, I love those half empty glasses. /jk Not acceptable only winning 2 games with the fixtures we’ve had The overall stats of his tenure are shite and we are sick of it. Defensively we are good but we can’t play football and we can’t score. The tactic seems to be pass it to Pickford or Tarky and hoof it to Dom and hope he can do something with it. 

Things could definitely be worse but things could also be a lot better. We picked up 11 points from 12 which statistically was the easiest fixture start of the league this season. Now we have a tough patch of games and I’ve we don’t pick up points we will find ourselves in the relegation zone by January. Getting out will be hard."
3534,Everton,"Don't mind him going as there's no real connection to the fan base, but I need a plan in place and executed well before the trigger is pulled. 

I think there's no way in hell he's gone before January so may as well just ride this one out. I think we'll get a good streak in there soon and people will back off dyche a little (not totally) and then we'll just scrape past relegation again. He'll leave the club when his contract expires and we'll all say cheers for the job done, but know it was always a marriage of convenience rather than love. 

He's done enough to see out his contract in my eyes, but that's mainly because there's no other options. I know it's been a bad time, and that it's going to be a long season, but I think it's better the devil you know. 

Who knows maybe Broja gets a game and we start banging them in. Here's hoping "
3535,Everton,"This exact situation happened with Lampard, Silva and Koeman then they got sacked. I can't see Dyche being in charge after January It's called the kiss of death.  

Board says they fully back the manager and then you blink and he's gone."
3536,Everton,Full backing of the board mentioned 🗣️🗣️🗣️ 🔥 
3537,Everton,"Dyche Ball lives or dies on the goal scoring skill of their No. 9. So it's not shocking that when you look at Dyche's team stats and DCL's individual stats, they're comparably dreadful. The fact that we're still trying to resign DCL is mindless. "
3538,Everton,I'm sure this would be the same outcome if the club had the money to replace him. 
3539,Everton,Well sure because we don't have a real board or present owner. 
3540,Everton,I’m just sick of watching these fools slop in crosses to no one. 
3541,Everton,"Everyone, publicly, has full support of management until the start meeting where they get fired. "
3542,Everton,"So sick of dycheball, if it keeps us up until we get funding, new coaching and management I'll be somewhat happy "
3543,Everton,"We are where we are through sacking managers with half baked squads. Giving the incoming manager sorting out a fragmented squad. 

The only way out of this mess is stability - not sacking managers. "
3544,Everton,I would be pissed off if potter went to leicester.  He is our only hope of getting a system that plays attacking football.   But i think he wud want a preseason .  Fingers crossed moyes goes to Leicester. I get the impression that Potter really benefited from Brighton being well run.  Chelsea are a bit of a clusterfuck and he suffered due to that.  This club is a lot more like Chelsea than it is Brighton.  I'm not interested in Potter.
3545,Everton,"Yeh, I love those half empty glasses. /jk "
3546,Everton,"Not acceptable only winning 2 games with the fixtures we’ve had If you look at those sides on paper, and what they have spent- you can see why we only won 2 games. 

Yea, the promoted teams came in with very underwhelming sides- but between them spent about 200m net. Remember that we have not had a season where we have spent more than we sold since 20/21

We have had to rely on the broken bodies Keane, Coleman, Young, Gueye and Doucoure - there are 3 players there over 35, there isn't another PL team who has fielded more than 1 player over 35. 

We can look at it and say we are grand old Everton. We should be beating the promoted sides, and the bottom of the table bottom feeders, but frankly our side is Championship level and we fortunate to have overperformed in the way we have."
3547,Everton,The overall stats of his tenure are shite and we are sick of it. Hate to break it to you but we were shite before he got here and our players won't magically get better when he leaves either. I saw Paddy Boyland flat out lied about his pts won in his recent article.
3548,Everton,"Defensively we are good but we can’t play football and we can’t score. The tactic seems to be pass it to Pickford or Tarky and hoof it to Dom and hope he can do something with it.

3549,Everton,"It's called the kiss of death.  

Board says they fully back the manager and then you blink and he's gone. "
3550,Everton,I get the impression that Potter really benefited from Brighton being well run.  Chelsea are a bit of a clusterfuck and he suffered due to that.  This club is a lot more like Chelsea than it is Brighton.  I'm not interested in Potter. 
3551,Everton,"If you look at those sides on paper, and what they have spent- you can see why we only won 2 games. 

Yea, the promoted teams came in with very underwhelming sides- but between them spent about 200m net. Remember that we have not had a season where we have spent more than we sold since 20/21

We have had to rely on the broken bodies Keane, Coleman, Young, Gueye and Doucoure - there are 3 players there over 35, there isn't another PL team who has fielded more than 1 player over 35. 

We can look at it and say we are grand old Everton. We should be beating the promoted sides, and the bottom of the table bottom feeders, but frankly our side is Championship level and we fortunate to have overperformed in the way we have. Completely agree with everything you said. As a contrast, Pickford has been a shining ray of sunshine amidst gloomy skies. Part of that is by choice though, and that choice is experience over youth and it’s one Dyche is making.

Patterson, O’Brien, Iroegbunam are all different players he could have used and cost £50m between them"
3552,Everton,"Hate to break it to you but we were shite before he got here and our players won't magically get better when he leaves either. Yeah it's not like Carlo turning Godfrey and all those wasters into incredible performing players or anything right. You do realise you're saying 'managers don't matter' like why do we even have them, you're so right bro."

Comparing our time with a world class manager and a much better squad to the last 3 managers is an unfair comparison and you know it.

Sacking Dyche does nothing when no manager who could be considered an upgrade would want to touch our mess of a club And look who Carlo brought in and how much money he spent doing so. Amazing that the ""wasters"" got so much better when they were surrounded by better and more creative players. 

Also, please tell me, which world class Champions League manager is coming to this shit show right now? I'll wait..."

Were you going anywhere with this sentence? Makes absolutely no sense at all

You're ignoring my point because you don't have one. We've lost 1 match in our last 8 and you're complaining like we are on a massive run of losses. You don't like Dyche and that's fine but you've failed to state any case for any other manager that you think would come in and upgrade the squad."

3573,Everton,"My god I remember all that peeling off when I had that kit in the 80’s. Didn’t help I used to pick at it like.

Oh the memories of good times gone by

OP where did you get this from?

Edit: one thing I always remember about this kit is how small the NEC looked Classicfootballshirts has a ton of these for sale Yeah it was always that way in the replica kits back then, the NEC on the actual kits went from badge to Umbro logo but on replica kits it was about half the size. This is actually from a vintage clothing store in my city, I never knew they sold football shirts before.

  
Retro shirts tend to be expensive but also bring a lot of memory even if I was not born back then lol.

  
I think I might add this to my collection soon."
3574,Everton,That’s my first kit that I got for Christmas in 86. Still have it to this day. Looks basically the same as your one.

3581,Everton,"It’s blatantly not. We have no real direction from the top of the club until Friedkins are in. Dyche ball is woeful but we’ve been in worse positions the last 2 years and came out on top.

Right now the club doesn’t care about playing exciting football or getting us to Europe. All we are focused on is financial stability and not getting relegated before we get into BMD. Sacking Dyche probably goes against both of those points. We ain’t getting rid of him this season. The team is massively underperforming, Dyche knew he needed to bank more points before December’s run of fixtures. What is actually more probable is that we’ll end up in the relegation zone with the next 3/4 fixtures, if that happens he’s gone."
3582,Everton,"Yes we aren’t great in the final third, but did I watch a different game to everyone else on Saturday?

The sending off ruined the game. Up to that point both teams were trying to score and as soon as they went down to ten men they let us have the ball and camped around their box. There was no chance for us to play at pace, overlap the fullbacks as they had nowhere to go.

Up to about the 70th minute they would at least try and play against us on the break and we should have gone at them at pace when they did, but from the 70th minute they shut up shop and settled for a draw. At one point one of their players had a chance to break, realised he was on his own, stopped in the centre circle, essentially gave us back the ball and got back into his defensive position.

I’m sure when Dyche takes training he’s telling them, when you have a shot, miss the target, when you do break through, pass to a defender. We just don’t have the players at present. Not sure what changing managers will achieve because it’s worked so well over the past few seasons where we’ve pretty much had the same squad. He sets us up so that we only have a chance against teams who attack us, the players don’t have a clue against teams who sit back. It was reminiscent of the S’ton game. We got to the final 3rd and then everyone stands there static because they don’t have a clue what to do. Oh come on, you cannot defend a manager saying the opposition going down to 10 ruined the game for us. If you’re struggling to play against 10 men more than 11 men, clearly your manager has no clue. I broadly agree with you, although I will say; If a first half red card for the opponent ruins a game for us we’re probably doing something wrong Our full backs overlap????? I tend to agree. The manager can only work with what he has. What Dyche has achieved over the last few seasons, given the circumstances, has been excellent. He is the right man for the job right now.

If you parachute in some up and coming manager from a random European league, and the squad largely remains the same, you're looking at having the best stadium in the championship next year. 

If/when the financial position improves, I have my doubts that he is the right man to lead us up the table and into CL but he has at least earned the right to have a go at it. How can you say the sending off ruined the game!? The sending off opens the door to 3 much needed points especially with over half the game still to play. The manager is paid £6M a year to have a plan. And that plan must include how to break down 10 men. The fact is the manager showed no invention and no initiative and no desire to bring home the 3 points that were presented to him. As for playing at pace and overlaps, show me when Dyche has ever set us up to do that against 11 never mind 10. 7 wins x 11 months. 1 goal x 4 games. If we don’t drop him now, I promise you we are finished."
3583,Everton,"What is the point of blaming the manager?

Everton are shit, let's sack Martinez.

Nothing changes. 

Everton are shit, let's sack Koeman.

Nothing changes

Everton are shit, let's sack Allardyce.

Nothing changes

Everton are shit, let's sack Silva.

Nothing changes

Everton are shit, but isn't Ancelotti awesome. Oh he left. 

Nothing changes

Everton are shit, let's sack Benitez.

Nothing changes

Everton are shit, let's sack Lampard.

Nothing changes Not really a fair assessment. Martinez had one great season and we stuck with him for two more. He had enough time and stability. The new manager had one good season and then almost relegated us. Big Sam was a one-season appointment. We stuck with Silva with a decent season but he clearly had to go and we replaced him with fucking Don Carlo.

The two appointments before Dyche were objectively horrible. They never had a chance. Dyche has now had two seasons and shows 0 progression. It is absolutely fair to want some change. Fun fact, all of our best seasons in the last decade were when we had just changed manager. 13-14, 16-17, 18-19, 20-21. It is 100% the manager: Not a single one of those managers was right for us

* Moyes had us qualifying for Europe - we hire Martinez, a manager who was working to fight relegation. Wrong appointment
* We regress under Martinez and need to begin rebuilding the team - we appoint Koeman, a manager who was already famously divisive. He unsurprisingly divides the team. We're now looking at relegation.
* We panic appoint Big Sam to stave off relegation. It was ok as a short term solution, the next manager had to be the right one. 
* We need someone experienced to rebuild and get us up the table. We appoint Silva, another inexperienced manager who hadn't rebuilt a team. Completely wrong appointment. He proves he's incapable of rebuilding the team, or handling the pressure of Everton. 
* From Silva onwards the club has just entered a doom loop, massively accelerated by Moshiri stacking the board with cronies who won't contradict him, and PSR reducing our options. 

It's brain dead from the club. Moshiri and Kenwright had grand plans to get us into the Champions League and their plan to achieve that was by hiring the managers from Wigan, Southampton, and then Watford?

When Abramovic took over Chelsea he went and got the best managers in the world. Man City messed around with Mark Hughes, then went and got Mancini and then Pep. 

On what planet do you hire the manager of Wigan, watch it fail and then go ""I think we should nick the Southampton manager""

After Martinez, they should've gone in for the likes of Ancelotti when we had money to spend. Imagine the team Ancelloti could've build with the £300m+ spent by Koeman, Big Sam and then Silva. Some amendments there. 
Everton are gona win a cup defo, oh new owner wants his own man in, lets sack martinez

3585,Everton,"Can we off with this, as a collective?

He's going nowhere until his contract expires. "
3586,Everton,"The amount of remonstrating the players are
Doing to eachother and dyche is doing to the team in the final third suggests to me the ‘dogshit sideways half arsed passing against a wall of bodies’ isnt his plan. The players look furious with eachother half the time. "
3587,Everton,"At the end of the day Dyche can't go out there and put the ball in the back of the net himself. We've missed countless chances this season which shows we are set up well enough to get into scoring positions and lack, quite significantly, any sort of end product. Our attacking “patterns” are non-existent. Either we pump the ball at Lewin’s head or we hope to score from a set piece. What do we work on in training? Aside from 10 men behind the ball? Fine, play deep and hit on the break away from home but we need to be more measured in how we attack most teams at Goodison. 

By the way, if we do practice set-pieces why do we have the same corner routine from every corner. McNeill aims for Tarks at the back post, Tarks tries to head across the area and hope something happens. Most managers must be ready for it by now. It’s too predictable. Mix it up, if only to make it feel like we’re not watching the same match every week. You’re right, he can’t put the ball in the back of the net himself. Just like the players can’t create an attacking game plan themselves."
3588,Everton,"It should be, but it really isn’t. "
3589,Everton,"Except it's not, this whining after every poor performance is as boring as the team itself!

He's certainly not going to be sacked whilst the club are in process of being sold and it's more likely new owners will be an appointment in summer when they'll have more time and managers are easier to recruit.

This kind of thinking is just foolish. He isn't going anywhere until the end of season. Dyche is to blame for some issues but a lot of what he's struggling with are due to conditions he's working under, which any manager would find difficult. That what he wants you to believe. 

Re the first paragraph. How long have you been watching us?"
3590,Everton,"Dyche needs to be out by Christmas. Don’t think it’s going to happen, 1 we can’t afford it, 2 who’s gonna make the decision Moshiri isn’t interested, 3 who we gonna get in his place knowing it might only be till the end of the season I have given up on him and i am the furthest from sack everyone bar cunts like allardyce and benitez of course .  My thoughts are get dyche to get us thru our shit run then see if potter wants it in January if not try for potter or biesla in summer if we have stayed up. Dear Santa, please give Mr. Dyche a big pay off this Christmas."
3591,Everton,"Our strikers have been poor at finishing, but we really don't create many GOOD chances.

Despite DCL missing a few sitters, he still doesn't get nearly enough chances as most strikers in the league. Most strikers that score a lot also miss a lot as well.

Unfortunately under Dyche, we have no attacking patterns whatsoever. Yes, you may think our players lack the composure at times (which they do) but watching us attack, there's just... nothing. Apart from crossing the ball in the box or set pieces, we are reduced to long range chances as we can't break teams down. It's not even teams who sit in a low block either, our build up is lethargic that even a team that doesn't sit back has plenty of time to get enough players behind the box.

Despite us having loads of attempts on Saturday, it was Brentford who had the best chances. "
3592,Everton,"Honest to God, it's like some of you just started watching football this week. 

How many times do we have to do the ""hire a manager, let him do well for a bit, fire him him when he falls off"" dance?
Dyche should stay until the end of the season and the takeover is complete. Then get someone in here to change the culture of this club. May 1992"
3593,Everton,"The team is massively underperforming, Dyche knew he needed to bank more points before December’s run of fixtures. What is actually more probable is that we’ll end up in the relegation zone with the next 3/4 fixtures, if that happens he’s gone. Spot on"
3594,Everton,"He sets us up so that we only have a chance against teams who attack us, the players don’t have a clue against teams who sit back. It was reminiscent of the S’ton game. We got to the final 3rd and then everyone stands there static because they don’t have a clue what to do. Bingo. They look like a team who hasn't done any attacking training the past 18 months besides ""knock it long"" Agreed, we have a manager who has only focused on making us solid and hard to beat and players who's attributes are focused on the same approach.

There is no plan in the final third and there isn't enough talent to make something happen without one. > He sets us up so that we only have a change against teams who attack us

Very, very few teams are just going to say “you know what, I just won’t attack!” And teams who try more of a bunker approach can often be baited into bad decisions and opening up space to exploit. That is precisely what the high press is for, which Dyche often has us do.

We are missing a consistent creative catalyst who can break down teams and make the incisive pass when teams set up shop. We really only have one player who can do it *inconsistently* — McNeil — and the rest of the team is often not on the same page (which is a major reason for the inconsistency). Dyche can’t magically imbue our attackers with imagination and the ability to see 2 or 3 passes ahead. 

In short, it’s not about how we’re set up. It’s not tactics. It’s about a crucial limitation in our current squad, brought about because of our financial situation and the constraints we’ve had to deal with in finding incoming players. It doesn’t matter what style we play, or who our manager is. Our ability to score goals will suffer until we can fill that need. Exactly - there's no movement in our midfield when bringing the ball into the opposing half.  Watch other teams advancing the ball and the midfielders - and forwards - are in motion and looking to get open for a pass, but Everton's tend to stand around or hover in very small areas."

3597,Everton,Our full backs overlap????? I was referring to a comment I had on another post on Saturday. I asked someone who wanted Dyche out what they would have done tactically against ten men camped in the box. His response was to inject pace and suggested getting our full backs to overlap (?). I’m not sure where they were going to overlap to as Brentwood were so deep.

3604,Everton,"Toffeeweb is an respectable fan site. It’s older than Reddit The age is irrelevant.

3605,Everton,"Our attacking “patterns” are non-existent. Either we pump the ball at Lewin’s head or we hope to score from a set piece. What do we work on in training? Aside from 10 men behind the ball? Fine, play deep and hit on the break away from home but we need to be more measured in how we attack most teams at Goodison. 

By the way, if we do practice set-pieces why do we have the same corner routine from every corner. McNeill aims for Tarks at the back post, Tarks tries to head across the area and hope something happens. Most managers must be ready for it by now. It’s too predictable. Mix it up, if only to make it feel like we’re not watching the same match every week. I'll say what I said to the other reply, if we are getting into the position for our attackers to sky it out of the stadium then clearly something is going on that got them into that position in the first place.

By all means we are not good, but Dyche seems to be copping it the harshest given that DCL has the same number of league goals as Michael Keane this season."
3606,Everton,"You’re right, he can’t put the ball in the back of the net himself. Just like the players can’t create an attacking game plan themselves. If we are getting into the position for the players to mess up in front of goal then clearly something is going on that got them into that position in the first place."
3607,Everton,"That what he wants you to believe. 

Re the first paragraph. How long have you been watching us? Nonsense, I'm just realistic. Firstly, why would Moshiri go the route of incurring further costs of sacking managerial staff when a new owner is on verge of taking over?

Please don't go down the 'how long have you been watching' route, it's childish and meaningless."
3608,Everton,"Don’t think it’s going to happen, 1 we can’t afford it, 2 who’s gonna make the decision Moshiri isn’t interested, 3 who we gonna get in his place knowing it might only be till the end of the season Very good points.

At the very least, when Friedkin comes in, he's immediately gonna start looking for replacements. Once a replacement comes in, Dyche is going out the door.

It may be February, or it may be summer."
3609,Everton,I have given up on him and i am the furthest from sack everyone bar cunts like allardyce and benitez of course .  My thoughts are get dyche to get us thru our shit run then see if potter wants it in January if not try for potter or biesla in summer if we have stayed up. 
3610,Everton,"Dear Santa, please give Mr. Dyche a big pay off this Christmas. Dear big balls Danny, we have all been very good boys and girls this year, please can we have Pierre Sage for Christmas. All our love evertonians xx"
3611,Everton,May 1992 
3612,Everton,Spot on Agree. Sleep walking towards relegation. Wouldn’t wait until Christmas. Get rid now.
3613,Everton,"Bingo. They look like a team who hasn't done any attacking training the past 18 months besides ""knock it long"" It only gets you so far, not good enough for a premier league team at all. You’re so right about the attacking training it genuinely baffles me how static we are, it’s not even that the players are lazy either we know they put a graft in defensively, even the midfielders and wingers, but then when teams sit back, we’ll knock it wide to a full back or winger, back to a midfielder in the centre, out wide, rinse and repeat till we lash a cross in that a forward hasn’t got much chance of winning cause, it’s a fucking abysmal watch."
3614,Everton,"Agreed, we have a manager who has only focused on making us solid and hard to beat and players who's attributes are focused on the same approach.

There is no plan in the final third and there isn't enough talent to make something happen without one. "
3615,Everton,"> He sets us up so that we only have a change against teams who attack us

Very, very few teams are just going to say “you know what, I just won’t attack!” And teams who try more of a bunker approach can often be baited into bad decisions and opening up space to exploit. That is precisely what the high press is for, which Dyche often has us do.

We are missing a consistent creative catalyst who can break down teams and make the incisive pass when teams set up shop. We really only have one player who can do it *inconsistently* — McNeil — and the rest of the team is often not on the same page (which is a major reason for the inconsistency). Dyche can’t magically imbue our attackers with imagination and the ability to see 2 or 3 passes ahead. 

In short, it’s not about how we’re set up. It’s not tactics. It’s about a crucial limitation in our current squad, brought about because of our financial situation and the constraints we’ve had to deal with in finding incoming players. It doesn’t matter what style we play, or who our manager is. Our ability to score goals will suffer until we can fill that need. "
3616,Everton,"Exactly - there's no movement in our midfield when bringing the ball into the opposing half.  Watch other teams advancing the ball and the midfielders - and forwards - are in motion and looking to get open for a pass, but Everton's tend to stand around or hover in very small areas. "
3617,Everton,I was referring to a comment I had on another post on Saturday. I asked someone who wanted Dyche out what they would have done tactically against ten men camped in the box. His response was to inject pace and suggested getting our full backs to overlap (?). I’m not sure where they were going to overlap to as Brentwood were so deep. Also Myko was playing extremely high up the entire second half. Made several runs beyond Ndiaye and McNeil
3618,Everton,The Bees game plan changed to all out defence after the red card. Especially in the last twenty minutes. Correct. And that should be no surprise so where was the plan?
3619,Everton,"Silva’s doing pretty well at Fulham The constant buying of relegated players and relegated managers is not good.  It rewards their relegation- they know it will be fine if relegation happens He's better today, but that's not the same Marco Silva. It's 6 years since we hired it. 

When we hired him his combined English experience was Hull and a season at Watford. 18 months in English football. 

Even today, if you're a consistent Top 6 side, you don't hire Marco Silva to get you in the Champions League."
3620,Everton,"Martinez did qualify for Europe, tbf He got a bounce because we got Lukaku and he had Moyes' defence - longer he stayed, the worse it got."
3621,Everton,"Thats a fair assessment, but we‘re not getting anyone even remotely close to Ancelotti when Dyche gets the sack. We‘ll be looking at the lower Premier Leauge/ Championship managers again. Nobody‘s going to fancy a job that even Ancelotti got fed up with after one year This is just negative thinking. 

We'll have one of the best stadiums in Europe. We've got one of the best CBs in Europe. New owners (hopefully) with big ambitions and money to spend. Absolute years of dross and underachievement. No expectation to win anything straight away. 

There won't be a better job going in the PL than the Everton one this summer.

Just checked the stats for total shots and shots on target so far this season to see if this is a consistent issue for Everton, and it is. Teams in the league vary between 30% and 46% of all shots being on target, with the average being 35%. Everton sits dead last at 30%. xG of 1.6.

Not necessarily. The game plan could be we sit back and look to counter. You could have a sequence that follows:

1. We make a break on the counter and all we need is a well placed pass to be through on goal. 

2. Somebody misplaces that pass

3. The attack is done because that misplaced pass kills momentum or turns the ball over

In that scenario you'd get 0 xG but the game plan has set us up to do well because we gained a promising position from the counter that is only ruined by somebody misplacing a pass."

We had so many shots from average positions and maybe 2-3 from dangerous spots. Shots mean fuck all in that case."

3662,Everton,"Sorry mate, I misread what you said. I do get your point. 

Apologies for the misunderstanding. "
3663,Everton,"""The stadium gets nervous"" - that's because YOU Sean, won't go after the game and make even the most obvious and basic changes when the game's *screaming* out for them and we're all expecting to concede a late goal to 10 men.

It's because we ALL know the script - don't change anything for 80 minutes. Even against 10 men. At home.

Throw Beto on immediately at half time and go for the fucking throat. The stadium **will** respond. We'd rather you had a go and lose than the same old script playing out. Not putting Beto on at half time to go 2 up front vs 10 men is unforgivable Dyche doesn't accept any responsibility for his tactics and in-game decisions. 

Our home record under Dyche is awful and he's referenced the fans negatively a number of times now. He just does not get the club. Goodison is an absolute bear pit under the right managers. Moyes is a conservative manager too, but he knew this and used it to his advantage. 

Every single game, no matter how utterly atrocious the performance (there's been A LOT of them now), he comes out with some false positivity like ""I'm happy we created a lot of chances"" or ""the players put in top effort and I can't ask more than that"" - he won't take responsibility but he's becoming increasingly quick to take aim at the fans talking negatively about the atmosphere and the constant need to 'reset expectations' 

The thing people forget about Dyche is that he's on £5m a year - puts him in the Top 5 best paid managers in the league AND on top of that he pocketed £3m for keeping us up as a bonus. Get him gone. I can’t believe I’m saying this but I’m no longer surprised at how poor we are. You know when you’re gutted on a Sunday cos we’ve lost on Saturday, well I find myself feeling like that before the match.
I find myself going to the match because it’s what I do, I just can’t get myself excited for the game anymore. I think it’s the endless tedium we’ve had to live through for the last ten years or so. 
I just want something to be excited about!!!!"
3664,Everton,"59 shots, 0 goals. Frankly that’s an appalling statistic It's honestly incredible. Just not good type of incredible No really Sean's fault that our players are just not good. That being said, the chances are not high quality shots which is something he should fix. Isn't that Finishing issue rather than Dyche one?"
3665,Everton,"We are 2 points above the relegation zone after 12 games that were relatively easier compared to other teams. 2 wins in 12. December is going to be rough. 

The cost of relegation far outweighs the cost of paying Dyche off. Neither is guaranteed though, we're full of shit top to bottom"
3666,Everton,"Wait, so I’ve scored the same amount of goals as the entire team in November? Sign me up "
3667,Everton,"The stadium wasn’t even that nervous yesterday. He’s grasping at straws with that line. If he felt nervous then they where his. If anything the stadium was frustrated. Agreed. There’s been plenty of times where the crowd gets tetchy and doesn’t have patience but yesterday was frustration as you said.

There’s no creativity in the players but there’s no plan from the manager to combat that other than cross from deep. He’s using nervous as a proxy for many fans getting on to him at the final whistle. The mood is turning with every game and Sean might just realise that he’s living on borrowed time. Crowd wasn't nervous but you could see the players were desperate"
3668,Everton,Don’t understand people defending him. Just hope for the transition so we can move on. It’s inherently needed. 
3669,Everton,"The fans are flat because the football you coach is shite, crazy thought I know. We are fed up of you now. "
3670,Everton,Get moyes in before leicester snap him up Are you joking? Do you really have so short a memory?
3671,Everton,His inability to adapt to the modern game is what forced him out at Burnley and what eventually gets him the sack here. Championship manager at best. 
3672,Everton,Literally there are MLS teams with more talented attacking fronts than ours. 
3673,Everton,"God damnit. 
Dyche isn't who we need long term. No doubt. 
But absolutely no one is going to come in right now and get this lot scoring goals like we want. 

It doesn't make sense to sack him now. We've done this before. We always do this. Look at the last however many years. 
Manager comes in, saves us for the time being, begins to shit the bed, shits the bed , gets sacked. 

Could it be that we have a culture problem at the club?
Could it be there is a confidence issue because we have to keep hiring managers that ""save us"" every time, and that plan sucks for the long term?

Dyche out. For sure. 
At the end of the season.
Get the new ownership team in. Spend some damned money on a striker and get Dom the fuck all the way out.
And bring in someone that isn't afraid to manage to a win, instead of trying not to lose. I don't think it's necessarily just Everton, every team cycles through managers too quickly these days. If you don't hit the ground running then you're out, it's ridiculous. 

Dyche isn't the man for the job, but his replacement needs to be someone who actually fits with the club's long term goals. Too often teams make a snap decision to fire their manager without actually having a plan for their replacement. We need an actual *good* manager, not ""the best available at the time""."
3674,Everton,"Clearly, the fans are at fault for not scoring enough goals. It’s so obvious. Nothing to do with selection, tactics, in game management. Definitely nothing to do with how they’re trained during the week. No sir. No way. All the fault of the fans. Goodison fans out!!! World record leap.

He hasn't once ever blamed the fans. Tbf he said the performance got flat and the stadium got nervous as a result of it. I don‘t agree with him but still a bit harsh to say he‘s blaming the fans"
3675,Everton,"Y'all are out of your mind if you think we need to sack a steady manager. If we've learned one thing, it's that steady managers don't come along often. Yeah, things are going badly. But we're above the drop. No way it makes sense to sack Dyche mid season.  "
3676,Everton,"I don't know how anyone who watched the match yesterday is still pro dyche Ir was the first match I have managed to get to in years, against 10 men we should be winning. Putting beto on late was bad but the players just can't score we can't fully blame dyche for that. We've had shots and chances the players need to take responsibility for not scoring any too."
3677,Everton,perhaps if our team managed to put it in the goal... no that's too farfetched 
3678,Everton,"A crowd that was embarrassed, watched the team throw away 2 goal leads back to back, watching the same hesitant football from players scared to attack, 

Yet it’s the crowds fault for being nervous. 

This guy doesn’t want the job. "
3679,Everton,"Mr Dyche, Sir. Please, please, please try to find yourself a 'Plan B'. What didn't work last week, and the week before definitely won't work next week. Or the one after.

You can not apply the 'law of averages' with this squad, hoping that simply by doing the same thing over and over, eventually they will do something right!

When the opportunity comes in a game to press the 'go for a win' button, as it did with them dropping to 10 men, push the fucking button!! Pull something out of your ""It's my responsibility"" bag, or your ""in my experience"" track suit pocket and be ruthless. We know what you will do. All other managers know what you will do. The media have already written what you'll do. It's time to do something,  anything, different. "
3680,Everton,"Just looked at Sky Sports News to see

3681,Everton,New owners are adamant there keeping him he needs to get home asap he’s a 🦖 
3682,Everton,"Who are we going to get? We need to stick with him at least till the end of the season. I don’t wear rose coloured spectacles anymore but I’m looking at this from reality. Now next week we lose badly and I’m all axe him now! Damn rollercoaster of emotions supporting Everton. Accustomed to it. >Who are we going to get?

Someone better. The end. The club some always have candidates lined up and it could be anyone. You know the names that we are linked with. 

Dyche isn’t working and now we have a big stint of tough games. There’s a very good chance we will be in the relegation zone over Christmas and getting out will be a huge task, especially for a team that’s only won 7 games since last December. 

Embarrassingly we haven’t scored a goal this month and DCL has not been the same since Big Dunc left his coaching role. Sticking with Dyche is not the right play here and it’s only going to get worse. Let’s not leave it until it’s too late. Steve Cooper, get him in, can’t be worse than the fucking dinosaur"
3683,Everton,#DYCHEOUT. That is all 
3684,Everton,Be careful the Dyche-inners will be at you.

There isn’t a world that this team is as bad as they are performing on paper. "
3687,Everton,"Not putting Beto on at half time to go 2 up front vs 10 men is unforgivable Do Beto and DCL really work together though? Every time i‘ve seen him try it they always seem disjointed. Broja or Chermiti alongside DCL or Beto might make 442 work for us Going 2 up front when it's never worked is worse than not doing it sooner Especially when Lindstrom wasnt adding much to the game. Not that he was bad, just contributed less than what we could have had with two strikers on the pitch"
3688,Everton,"Dyche doesn't accept any responsibility for his tactics and in-game decisions. 

Our home record under Dyche is awful and he's referenced the fans negatively a number of times now. He just does not get the club. Goodison is an absolute bear pit under the right managers. Moyes is a conservative manager too, but he knew this and used it to his advantage. 

Every single game, no matter how utterly atrocious the performance (there's been A LOT of them now), he comes out with some false positivity like ""I'm happy we created a lot of chances"" or ""the players put in top effort and I can't ask more than that"" - he won't take responsibility but he's becoming increasingly quick to take aim at the fans talking negatively about the atmosphere and the constant need to 'reset expectations' 

The thing people forget about Dyche is that he's on £5m a year - puts him in the Top 5 best paid managers in the league AND on top of that he pocketed £3m for keeping us up as a bonus. Get him gone. "
3689,Everton,"I can’t believe I’m saying this but I’m no longer surprised at how poor we are. You know when you’re gutted on a Sunday cos we’ve lost on Saturday, well I find myself feeling like that before the match.
I find myself going to the match because it’s what I do, I just can’t get myself excited for the game anymore. I think it’s the endless tedium we’ve had to live through for the last ten years or so. 
I just want something to be excited about!!!! I'm gutted on Friday. Brentford went down to 10 men at goodison and you still can't even sniff a goal, that's when you know your shite"
3690,Everton,It's honestly incredible. Just not good type of incredible 
3691,Everton,"No really Sean's fault that our players are just not good. That being said, the chances are not high quality shots which is something he should fix. It could be argued that he's the one coaching them though. Ancelloti and Dunc had dcl looking like Pele. I get it's different roles but even when he's getting chances he's not scoring them. How about he doesn't continuously start a striker that has no goal threat, can't shoot, can't offer a run, has shit movement, can't find space in the box, scores about 1 in 50 headers, most unnatural striker I've ever seen play upfront for us some in my life, won't sign, won't leave, won't score"
3692,Everton,Isn't that Finishing issue rather than Dyche one? 
3693,Everton,"Neither is guaranteed though, we're full of shit top to bottom "
3694,Everton,"Agreed. There’s been plenty of times where the crowd gets tetchy and doesn’t have patience but yesterday was frustration as you said.

There’s no creativity in the players but there’s no plan from the manager to combat that other than cross from deep. "
3695,Everton,He’s using nervous as a proxy for many fans getting on to him at the final whistle. The mood is turning with every game and Sean might just realise that he’s living on borrowed time. 
3696,Everton,Crowd wasn't nervous but you could see the players were desperate 
3697,Everton,"Are you joking? Do you really have so short a memory? If you're on about him running his contract down are you even arsed anymore? It's been a shit show ever since he left, shows what good job he did for us, I wouldn't be buzzing if we got him in but I wouldn't be worried and I'm well over him pissing of to man u, every manager in the world would have done the same at the time"
3698,Everton,"I don't think it's necessarily just Everton, every team cycles through managers too quickly these days. If you don't hit the ground running then you're out, it's ridiculous. 

Dyche isn't the man for the job, but his replacement needs to be someone who actually fits with the club's long term goals. Too often teams make a snap decision to fire their manager without actually having a plan for their replacement. We need an actual *good* manager, not ""the best available at the time"". "
3699,Everton,"World record leap.

He hasn't once ever blamed the fans. "
3700,Everton,"Tbf he said the performance got flat and the stadium got nervous as a result of it. I don‘t agree with him but still a bit harsh to say he‘s blaming the fans He’s got previous for suggesting the Everton fans don’t support their team. After Brighton he seemed to imply that the fans were fickle for getting off at 0-2 and down to 10 men - “…that’s what they do here”. 

If only he concentrated as much on the things he can control like coaching, selections and tactics."
3701,Everton,"Ir was the first match I have managed to get to in years, against 10 men we should be winning. Putting beto on late was bad but the players just can't score we can't fully blame dyche for that. We've had shots and chances the players need to take responsibility for not scoring any too. Mate, we haven't scored for an entire month. Let that sink in. 3 goals in 6 games is an issue. Truly shit teams score more than 0.5 goals/game. Shhhh, we don't do equal blame. It's  all on dyche!"
3702,Everton,">Who are we going to get?

Someone better. The end. Santa Claus? I do get where you’re coming from. New manager brings a new attitude."
3703,Everton,"The club some always have candidates lined up and it could be anyone. You know the names that we are linked with. 

Dyche isn’t working and now we have a big stint of tough games. There’s a very good chance we will be in the relegation zone over Christmas and getting out will be a huge task, especially for a team that’s only won 7 games since last December. 

Embarrassingly we haven’t scored a goal this month and DCL has not been the same since Big Dunc left his coaching role. Sticking with Dyche is not the right play here and it’s only going to get worse. Let’s not leave it until it’s too late. "
3704,Everton,"Steve Cooper, get him in, can’t be worse than the fucking dinosaur What makes you think Cooper is going to take the Everton job? It's a poisoned chalice"
3705,Everton,We’re going for the Month of the Goal competition. 
3706,Everton,Do Beto and DCL really work together though? Every time i‘ve seen him try it they always seem disjointed. Broja or Chermiti alongside DCL or Beto might make 442 work for us I don't think we have the players for a 4-4-2.  Also that seems to be an archaic formation at this point.  Two strikers is more a situational in game thing rather than something to start the game with.  The situation changed and called for Beto once Brentford went down a player.  The situation calls for a second striker when we are down as Dyche has correctly made that move at times this season.
3707,Everton,Going 2 up front when it's never worked is worse than not doing it sooner It's never worked because Dyche has never given it time to work. Simple as.
3708,Everton,"Especially when Lindstrom wasnt adding much to the game. Not that he was bad, just contributed less than what we could have had with two strikers on the pitch We can and should use Lindstrom as needed but Jack Harrison is a better player even with the frustrations that Harrison can bring."
3709,Everton,I'm gutted on Friday. 
3710,Everton,"Brentford went down to 10 men at goodison and you still can't even sniff a goal, that's when you know your shite "
3711,Everton,"It could be argued that he's the one coaching them though. Ancelloti and Dunc had dcl looking like Pele. I get it's different roles but even when he's getting chances he's not scoring them. Carlo also also had digne and james serving up chances from 6 yards out 4 or 5 times a game.

Myko spooned one close to the upper gwladys yesterday, with loads of time and no pressure.

Ashley young was probably our most effective chance creator and even when he put a few good balls in, we failed to make the most of them. It's also the fact there was James, digne, Richie, Bernard, Coleman on form all giving him it on a plate from 6 yards..."
3712,Everton,"How about he doesn't continuously start a striker that has no goal threat, can't shoot, can't offer a run, has shit movement, can't find space in the box, scores about 1 in 50 headers, most unnatural striker I've ever seen play upfront for us some in my life, won't sign, won't leave, won't score And start an absolute donkey instead. Not saying you are wrong but beto has looked shite so far so it's not like he is clearly better than dom."
3713,Everton,"If you're on about him running his contract down are you even arsed anymore? It's been a shit show ever since he left, shows what good job he did for us, I wouldn't be buzzing if we got him in but I wouldn't be worried and I'm well over him pissing of to man u, every manager in the world would have done the same at the time I meant that his football was fucking dreadful, utterly turgid & depressing, I remember the feeling that nobody was arsed he was leaving because we all knew it was for the best as he couldn't take us to the next level.

Plus he's failed at every club he's been at since. Oh and I don't care that he wanted the United job, but I do care that he insulted our club after leaving by accusing us of holding back Baines & Fellaini for not accepting their derisory bids, £25m for the pair wasn't it? 

The ginger cunt can fuck off, I'm never supporting a Moyes side again. The fact we'd even contemplate bringing him back shows how totally embarrassing a situation we're in and how we are totally devoid of ideas or originality or any sense of hope for gehuine improvement. We'd be accepting mediocrity by bringing back someone West Ham didn't want. 

This quote sums it up:

_After the hundreds of millions spent on players throughout Moyes' second spell in charge, West Ham felt no manager could have survived results over the past five months - unless you accept you are a bottom three side._

I want someone with vision, not a dinosaur like Moyes."

Carlo had it better but not to that degree and that's where tactics come in.  Carlo is a far better manager than Dyche and put players in a position to succeed.  Dyche is incapable of doing that."

I want someone with vision, not a dinosaur like Moyes. I'd forgotten about the Baines & Fellaini bids actually, he doesn't do the bidding though. I want a young modern manager long term, Thomas Frank actually if he'd come, but wouldn't lose any sleep if Moyes came in now for a year or so, don't think we'd go down and the football couldn't be any worse. He did win Europe with West ham tbf. I was sick of Moyes at the end but bar Martinez first year it's been shite and it makes you reflect on the stability odd European finish and cup finals he got us to"
3727,Everton,"I'm not saying we don't have massive issues but I think players have to take accountability for the chances they miss, and also our defence has been pretty solid. I'm not faulting the defense and we're thin on talent for the attacking third. However, it's up to the manager to adapt tactics and try to generate some goals. There's absolutely no reason for us to wait as long as dyche does for subs and DCL has been putrid at actually scoring for far too long. 

Outside of a lucky long shot or header from a set piece, this team has absolutely no threat. Beto at least gets into dangerous positions even though he's shite. DCL is statistically one of, if not the worst strikers at converting his chances."
3728,Everton,Santa has lots in common with Dyche. Both of them getting the sack at Crimbo. Both myths
3729,Everton,"Yeh i agree, i just think Beto isn‘t particularly good and him and DCL seem to cancel each other out. It would be nice to have a decent option to bring on from the bench It depends on how we are playing.  We seem to lump the ball in which in my opinion calls for DCL and Beto.  Though if we are talking limited minutes and limited running then Keane is a better option than Beto.  DCL should still be starting over Beto.  We can get to alternatives later since both Chermiti and Broja can't play yet. Beto created 3 chances within 10 mins of coming on"
3730,Everton,Or because when we do there's no creativity and the midfield gets overrun 
3731,Everton,"Carlo had better crossing options for sure.  Carlo was also forced to play his team defensively because the overall quality wasn't great.

Carlo is a far better manager than Dyche and put players in a position to succeed.  Dyche is incapable of doing that. Carlo is miles better than dyche.

That crop of players was also better balanced and more talented. Better fullbacks, comparable CBs and a much better attack with Richie and james alongside dom. 

You can argue about the midfield in terms of work rate, but siggurdson contributed more goals and assists than any midfielder has since and and Allan, Delph and gomes were all better footballers. Even Bernard and iwobi were better options than Harrison or lindstrom.

From our current crop of players, only pickford, dom and branthwaite make it into Carlos team."
3732,Everton,Sigurdsson aswell 
3733,Everton,Yeah start him. He offers more than Dom around the goal clearly

From our current crop of players, only pickford, dom and branthwaite make it into Carlos team. Ndiaye would absolutely make it into Carlo's team.  

Dyche hardly played Gomes and it might've been Dyche who sent him out on loan.  That is unless I'm misremembering and it was Lampard and Dyche inherited the loan.  

One would like to think that Dyche would play James but the reality is that Dyche focuses on defense and fitness above all else and those aren't James' strongest attributes.  Would Dyche have built a formation around James?  

I doubt that Dyche would've played Gomes and Sigurdsson who were worse technical/finesse players than James.  

The reality is that Carlo is a flexible manager and Dyche is inflexible.  Carlo had a bit better of a team but he is also a manger capable of utilizing those better players with varying skillsets, Dyche is not. >…comparable centre backs…

Holgate and Keane? Comparable to Tarkowski and Branthwaite?"

You're changing rhe conversation now though. Carlo had tools that could be used to breakdown and unlock teams. Dyche has none of those tools and a significantly worse squad.

I'm not letting dyche off the hook, but he doesn't have anywhere close to the same options and came into a much worse situation across the board. I want him gone as much as anyone at this point, but we don't need to revise history to justify it. Dyche would hesitate to play James. He didn’t have enough “premier league experience”."

3748,Everton,"Bizarre considering your posting history suggests you're a red lol

There's no great way of getting back to London without driving at that time tbh mate. Although it's pretty unlikely you'd get tickets for the match in the first place assuming you haven't already got them already "
3749,Everton,"I would see if there are any london based supporters clubs, you could possibly hitch a lift with someone back to london, or hire a car. The London Suppprters' Club has some rather strict entry requirements and (if memory serves) a membership fee.

Hiring a car may actually be the best option as it's probably cheaper than a taxi, as well as being much quicker and less painful than a bus. Also, most car hire companies will have offices in London so you shouldn't have to worry about getting your hired car back to Liverpool again."
3750,Everton,Kopite 
3751,Everton,I think most of us are confused. Post history points to you being a Kopite. Explain yourself lad

3753,Everton,"Regardless of Dyche in or Dyche out, appointing a new manager to basically immediately face City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, and United is probably not going to get off to a good start.Fans would sour so quickly. Yeah at this point I'd probably keep him for December even though I want him out.

Hopefully we'll get the takeover complete too se we'll have someone who's not Moshiri picking the manager >Fans would sour so quickly.

Dyche won 3 of his first 14 games

Lampard won 2 in his first 9 league games, 1 in his first 6. 

This idea that fans sour quickly is such nonsense. It took Lampard another 20 odd games for him to sour and it took Dyche 2 years to be questioned"
3754,Everton,Broja playing for the 21s tonight. Armstrong should be dropping down as well hopefully as he's at real risk of having nearly a full season without football if it continues the way it is Do you know if this is live on YouTube? (sometimes it is) I know Armstrong is really young but I'd have liked to see him out on a league 2 loan.
3755,Everton,"The biggest issue I have with Brentford match. Down to 10 men, no attacking threat, yet we wait for 72' to bring on a 2nd striker. They were sitting 9 in the box and we didn't have enough bodies for our only strategy of crossing. Beto got on the end of a couple once he was on. If we can't even score against a 10 man Brentford then we are in big trouble. I don't think not having 2 strikers on was the issue, the vast majority of teams that are better than us, and even most that are worse than us, would not play with 2 strikers to try and take advantage of being a man up. With the way football is played today, 2 strikers does not equal more attacking threat even against a side sat back in their own box.

 I have more of a problem with the cross and hope strategy regardless of how many forwards we have on. In my opinion that's why we had no threat, not that we didn't just throw another big lump in the box soon enough."
3756,Everton,I'd love Eddie howe Boyhood everton fan… only works if he is sacked.. their supporters are pissed
3757,Everton,"🚨Sean Dyche has the full backing of Farhad Moshiri and the board of directors. Dyche will be in charge for the foreseeable future 

(Source - @ALANMYERSMEDIA - @SkySportsNews )

https://x.com/EvertonNewsFeed/status/1860974641965080955?t=EAlBgKBINFmSef-m-T24jw&s=19 The ""backing"" of Farhad Moshiri.

When friedkin is confirmed that's out of his power.

We're not stupid every time we hear or read Manager has the full backing of whoever the hell they work for that only leads to one thing to the gaffer in charge.

If we don't pick up wins there's a change.

Improve the final attacking third for fucks sake. The dreaded vote of confidence? This has to be a joke right? I mean Moshiri wont even be here by the end of the year Anyone have Moshiri’s bank details? Reckon we can pass them onto Friedkin"
3758,Everton,"Dele setback, must be heartbreaking for him if he truly wants to get back  playing "
3759,Everton,"This sub would have you think that the majority of fans would see Everton relegated if it meant they are right about Dyche I can't understand how people defend him, we've won 7 games in 11 months. A full season is 9.

Could you imagine how many of the people defending him would lose their shit if you told them in August that by May we'd have won 7 games?"
3760,Everton,"Can people who still want DCL to start give me some good solid reasons why ? I know Beto is a bit shit himself, but surely we have to try something. I just find were more chaotic as a unit when Beto starts. He's good for when games are stretched but when the game is tight, not so much. We are plainly worse at getting up the pitch with Beto instead of DCL, even if Beto is more likely to score if we do get up the pitch. Not saying I agree Comes on and is instantly more of a threat than DCL. What am I missing? There are no solid reasons. 

When you've got a striker who isn't performing and you've got the option to freshen things up, a good manager does that. It's not even about ability. Sometimes it's motivation for the first choice striker to stay ahead or a chance to rest him up to get that little bit sharper - 2 things DCL badly needs right now.

Beto is by no means a long-term solution to our goal issues, but Dyche's management of him is SHOCKING. He's only given him 9 league starts from a total 38 available, and Beto has only just surpassed 1,000 minutes on the pitch for us in his entire time with us (DCL has 988 minutes just this season). 

Things happen when Beto is on the pitch and he gives his all. That's a lot more than what I see from DCL right now. Something something Ancelotti."

They’ve got 4 points after 12 games. They’re not better than 3 other teams."

3763,Everton,"Guaranteed we are going to be 19th after the next 6 games! I've always thought somehow someway we would always survive, but if we keep him in charge we are going to get relegated and of all the times to do it, Goodison's final season. "

3766,Everton,Lopetegui getting a response out of his players after a 2 week break. Meanwhile Dyche continues to talk about ‘fine margins’. About time with the side he’s got. They’re the biggest underperforming side in the league with the talent they can put on the pitch. Bit of a weird comment because this is Dyches second year here. He has gotten a tune out of the players. We've had good runs under him.

West Ham were never going to be a factor. Whether it’s with Lopetgui or not, their squad is far, far too good to get properly involved with our bunch. If only we went at brentford when they were down to 10 men… but west ham were never gonna truly be in a battle"
3770,Everton,"We have reached 'The Lampard defense' now of Dyches tenure at Everton. 'These players are bad no matter what' might be the most ridiculous argument I have ever seen it's it's no weirdly common on here. They are crap, we’re literally hundreds of millions behind the other teams in the league in terms of spending. The squad is a made up of people whose former clubs were willing to let them go for no money up front, that’s the transfer philosophy Can you make a case for why our players shouldn't be considered bad?"
3771,Everton,"Yeah at this point I'd probably keep him for December even though I want him out.

Hopefully we'll get the takeover complete too se we'll have someone who's not Moshiri picking the manager "
3772,Everton,">Fans would sour so quickly.

Dyche won 3 of his first 14 games

Lampard won 2 in his first 9 league games, 1 in his first 6. 

This idea that fans sour quickly is such nonsense. It took Lampard another 20 odd games for him to sour and it took Dyche 2 years to be questioned There were fans vocally against both of them before a ball had even been kicked. Dyche beat arsenal in his first game which is always going to immediately end ear him to a lot of fans. "
3773,Everton,Do you know if this is live on YouTube? (sometimes it is) It won't be as PL rules are if there are live football then it cannot be broadcast
3774,Everton,I know Armstrong is really young but I'd have liked to see him out on a league 2 loan. He wouldn't be ready for league 2 and would be much better off staying in my opinion.
3775,Everton,"I don't think not having 2 strikers on was the issue, the vast majority of teams that are better than us, and even most that are worse than us, would not play with 2 strikers to try and take advantage of being a man up. With the way football is played today, 2 strikers does not equal more attacking threat even against a side sat back in their own box.

 I have more of a problem with the cross and hope strategy regardless of how many forwards we have on. In my opinion that's why we had no threat, not that we didn't just throw another big lump in the box soon enough. Maybe, but have to try something. We had no threat once they went a man down, just crappy shots into a stacked box. There was a single shot all game with higher than .1 xG and that was the 2nd Beto header. 

I get being conservative with our squad in an even game. But we just passed the ball around the perimeter and crossed into a single forward most of the match. At least a 2nd forward gives you another head to find. Hell, if that's the strategy get Keane in there also. 

Agreed a different strategy entirely would have been preferable. But doing the same thing for 30 minutes up a man with no results is a bad look. Brentford only had 3 shots with 10 men so not like they were even a serious threat."
3776,Everton,"Boyhood everton fan… only works if he is sacked.. their supporters are pissed Here's hoping. The turnaround Newcastle had when he came in at Xmas.

3777,Everton,"The ""backing"" of Farhad Moshiri.

When friedkin is confirmed that's out of his power.

We're not stupid every time we hear or read Manager has the full backing of whoever the hell they work for that only leads to one thing to the gaffer in charge.

If we don't pick up wins there's a change.

Improve the final attacking third for fucks sake. "
3778,Everton,The dreaded vote of confidence? 
3779,Everton,"This has to be a joke right? I mean Moshiri wont even be here by the end of the year Why would it be a joke? He’s not going to pay him out when he’s hopefully in the final month of his tenure.

He’ll correctly leave that to the next guy to decide."
3780,Everton,Anyone have Moshiri’s bank details? Reckon we can pass them onto Friedkin 
3781,Everton,"I can't understand how people defend him, we've won 7 games in 11 months. A full season is 9.

Could you imagine how many of the people defending him would lose their shit if you told them in August that by May we'd have won 7 games? This also extends to the detractors. Some people in this thread are gleeful at the thought of us being in the drop after December"
3782,Everton,"I just find were more chaotic as a unit when Beto starts. He's good for when games are stretched but when the game is tight, not so much. I think this *used* to be my rational. Dom holds it up better, flick ons are better, his general ability on the ball is better.

However he isn't really doing any of those things at the minute. 

So when he loses the things he's better at, you might as well go for the guy who is at least getting I to threat areas. Especially in a game like the weekend where he would have had, what 6/7 direct chances if he started? He'd have probably converted at least 1?"
3783,Everton,"We are plainly worse at getting up the pitch with Beto instead of DCL, even if Beto is more likely to score if we do get up the pitch. Not saying I agree "
3784,Everton,Comes on and is instantly more of a threat than DCL. What am I missing? 
3785,Everton,"There are no solid reasons. 

When you've got a striker who isn't performing and you've got the option to freshen things up, a good manager does that. It's not even about ability. Sometimes it's motivation for the first choice striker to stay ahead or a chance to rest him up to get that little bit sharper - 2 things DCL badly needs right now.

Beto is by no means a long-term solution to our goal issues, but Dyche's management of him is SHOCKING. He's only given him 9 league starts from a total 38 available, and Beto has only just surpassed 1,000 minutes on the pitch for us in his entire time with us (DCL has 988 minutes just this season). 

Things happen when Beto is on the pitch and he gives his all. That's a lot more than what I see from DCL right now. "

I have responded to your point, multiple times. Let me put it in simple terms for you:

If the last 3 managers have struggled to get anywhere with this squad maybe it isn't entirely on the managers.

If a world class manager, who has won 5 champions leagues, could only get 10th with a better squad than we currently have maybe some of that is to do with the players.

So yes managers have an impact incase that wasn't obvious to you from what I've said, but eventually you have to realise that managers are not the only reason teams don't get results."
3812,Everton,There's fans vocally against every aspect of football at any given time. That doesn't mean the majority would sour against a manager.

I think he's certainly better than a lot of the other duds we've sent on loans. I think certainly better than the other 'duds' is one way of looking at it for a player with 9 games of U21 football under his belt. I suspect that's over-rating Armstrong a bit and under-rating just how competitive league 2 is and how good our duds were. Onyango for example is probably someone you could describe as a dud, and he had shown more to this point than Armstrong for both England and Everton. Loans are probably what damaged him the most.

And it could be handled worse by him being sent to a league 2 side, not getting picked and only training with them instead of us - where they care less for development. There's only 2 teenagers on loan from prem clubs in the entire of league 2, last season there was 3 all year, its just not the done thing especially if you think the lad you've got might be half decent.

Dixon on the other hand, should be on loan."

How so? Think he's barely improved since he got here. He's played, but often on right of midfield, at right back, and when he is in central midfield he's often asked to sit deep while the likes of Gana and Doucoure ending up on the ball more often in attacking positions. Drives me nuts."

3828,Everton,"Isn’t 37 points historically marginally safe? But it’s too close for comfort this year. I think Southampton are certs but us and several others all have a decent chance of going down. They managed to put 2 past the shites today, I don't see us doing the same at the moment. Last season 27 points was undisputed safety. 22-23 it was 35, 21-22 it was 36, 20-21 it was 29, 19-20 it was 35. 32.4 points is safety on average over the last 5 years, so let's say 33 should be about target to stay up by the skin of our teeth."
3829,Everton,"Definitely. 

If we can get 7 points from the next 6 matches:

Man United A

Wolves H

Liverpool H

Arsenal A

Chelsea H

Man City A

We'll be back on course for 1 point per game. No idea where 7 points comes from here unfortunately Easy just beat Liverpool and city then draw with Wolves. Should be easy right? Genuinely think we'll struggle to get more than 2 points from this run 5 nil nil draws and a spanking from Wolves coming right up Boss Realistically thats 2 wins and a draw. I'd be amazed! It's likely we'll take 1 points best case out of those."

Since our stupid start to the season we've conceded 4 goals in 8 games, and they've conceded 16. Defence also makes a big difference The officiating in the game was below abysmal. A competent ref and they don't get the looks to put two passed. Plus Alison didn't play so they got lucky there"

Are you really comparing Ipswich and Brentford’s attack to Chelsea, City, Arsenal and the shite? I’m not, but the performances that Brentford and Ipswich have managed against the biggest teams (eg Ipswich v spurs and today, Brentford’s fast starts v City and Spurs) proved they can attack very well. And the match the pair fought between each other will be remembered as one of the best matches thus far this season. Is that joint 4th most goals scored with City Brentford or is there a different, worse Brentford I don't know about? People should not discount that for all our problems going forward, we have a very solid defence - one of the best in the league."

3854,Everton,"You're not comparing apples to apples.

When someone says ""better footballer"" the assumption is that they're talking about technical *attacking* skills and flair, so Miralles wins that hands down. Hibbert could never do what Miralles did.

However, very few could touch Hibbert as a right back, and in that sense he's a better (defensive) footballer than Miralles.

Either way, I'd take Hibbert over Miralles any day. Completely this. From a team planning standpoint, I will take the guy I can rely on to do his job without any drama for over a decade over the flashy and gifted but he knows it guy."
3855,Everton,"Footballing ability, it's Mirallas and it's not close. 

However, Hibbert was good at defending. "
3856,Everton,"Oh tony hibbert, he scores when he wants! "
3857,Everton,I would rather Hibbert at the club over Mirallas. Mirallas was obviously better at football 
3858,Everton,"Don’t think you can really compare the two as they played completely different roles.
However I loved Tony Hibbert, he was Everton through and through. Always remember one game against Liverpool when due to injuries etc he had to play centre back and was outstanding "
3859,Everton,You serious? 
3860,Everton,"Next up, would you rather your home kit be blue or without collars? "
3861,Everton,"Hibbert has a 100% penalty conversion rate.

Mirallas robbed the ball off Baines then missed his pen the fucking divvy.

Case closed. That really did it for me, I was there and absolutely furious! Lost respect for KM after that and Martinez was so weak in his response. Probably caused a shit show in squad morale"
3862,Everton,"Today we need Hibbo much more. But as much as he’s a hero, Super Kev was technically more gifted. I think if we get one game with either of them this weekend, given the way Ashley Young has played lately, I’d take mirallas Nah we’d need mirralas way more, could score from anything, created all kinds. The likes of him is what we’re missing up front. Defensively we’re not bad."
3863,Everton,Mirallas by a country mile. Hibbert was a liability.. 
3864,Everton,"If talking in terms of pure ability, then it’s Tony hibbert, because the best ability, is availability "
3865,Everton,"With a healthy Branthwaite in the lineup, we are pretty good in the back. 

Were absolute shite up front and lack pace. Lindstrom started on the wing last game and looked generally clueless.

It’s Mirallas by a mile. "
3866,Everton,"Mirallas all day long, talented footballer "
3867,Everton,"I love Hibbo but this isn’t even a debate, Mirallas all day long. "
3868,Everton,"Mirallas was the better footballer but like alot of flair players he blew hot and cold, he would also act like a petulant child at times. Hibbo was a solid reliable 7/10 every week kind of player, and a much better defender than often given credit for. Overall I would take a Hibbo in my squad for the professionalism, reliability and hard work but given are current issues scoring goals I would take an in form Mirallas. "
3869,Everton,"Hibbo is one of my favourite ever players - but let's face it, outside of tackling his ability was probably League One standard at best. Every kick off the ball would be played back to him and he'd just smash a hopeful ball forward. 

He looked so good for a few years because Phil Nev or Mikel would drop back to take the ball off him whenever he tackled someone. 

Hands down it's Mirallas "
3870,Everton,"Mirallas was a match winner when performing well and I think if the club hadn’t descended into general chaos from the mid Martinez/early Moshiri years he could’ve contributed on a consistent basis a lot longer. He seemed to mentally check out from there. And fuck knows why he got that last big contract. 

Hibbert is a player you’d take in your squad as a back up, solid enough but overall a bit crap and not really the level required for a good premier league team. "
3871,Everton,"Completely this. From a team planning standpoint, I will take the guy I can rely on to do his job without any drama for over a decade over the flashy and gifted but he knows it guy. "
3872,Everton,"That really did it for me, I was there and absolutely furious! Lost respect for KM after that and Martinez was so weak in his response. Probably caused a shit show in squad morale "
3873,Everton,"I think if we get one game with either of them this weekend, given the way Ashley Young has played lately, I’d take mirallas "
3874,Everton,"Nah we’d need mirralas way more, could score from anything, created all kinds. The likes of him is what we’re missing up front. Defensively we’re not bad. "
3875,Everton,"Yeah, no player sent off at U21 level has ever gone on to have a good career. 

Patterson may not, but one of my primary gripes with Dyche is his absolute incapacity to develop players in his squad. Other than Branthwaite I struggle to think of a single player who's better now than he was when Dyche took over, and I'm more inclined to attribute Branthwaite's success as being in spite of him rather than because of. Branthwaite developed because of his time in Holland and the CL. He’s good enough not to need hand holding by a manger. Also bit of a difference between a player being sent off at u21 level if they’re u21 and not a full fledged professional footballer.  Patterson was shit before Dyche though? Did Mykolenko not develop last season? McNeil too? "
3876,Everton,"Young isn't a long term answer, but in the last 2 months, he has been far, far from the biggest problem. I have no issues with Young continuing at RB right now - if Patterson is this far off the pace that he can't hang in U21 games, no need to worry about rushing him into the squad. He's coming off a long-ish term injury, so I'm really not reading too much into it, but we have absolutely no depth at the position as Seamus is never healthy these days. A sensible comment. "
3877,Everton,What has being sent off in an U21 game got to do with playing for the first team Because if you’re not good enough to deal with an u21s winger without getting two yellows how can you expect to play Prem football?
3878,Everton,Two new fullbacks needed ASAP Correct him and Mykolenko are dogshit and Young is ancient even if he’s been good the last few weeks. 
3879,Everton,A lot of people have a lot of opinions about a game none of you watched 
3880,Everton,"[deleted] No, it wasn’t it was Nathan Patterson, you divvy.

3885,Everton,Patterson was shit before Dyche though? Did Mykolenko not develop last season? McNeil too?  He was a 20yo full international fullback before Dyche and has barely played since through a combination of injury and dinosaur football tactics that don't allow fullbacks past the halfway line.
3886,Everton,A sensible comment.  
3887,Everton,Because if you’re not good enough to deal with an u21s winger without getting two yellows how can you expect to play Prem football? You do know his first yellow card was for dissent Neither yellow was for a live-ball infraction.

3904,Everton,"Honestly. Dyches system can work But its failing for one reason, none of our strikers can score a goal. There were at least 5 goalscoring opportunities in that last game, and they missed all of them. Thats fucking diabolical, and I think thats down on the players.  > none of our strikerz can score a goal

Yet we've have the answer toiling away at defender this whole time."
3905,Everton,Both posted by the same account. 
3906,Everton,"I can see both sides, don't want to keep playing musical chairs at manager but he's overcautious ending up with draws - don't be stupid, but risking 1 point to get 3 would work with at least 33% odds "

I think, no matter your take on whether Dyche should be manager, we need to be realistic about the fact that our financial situation probably doesn't allow us to pay off Dyche and sign someone else in the middle of the season."

3920,Everton,"I'd like to have the confidence to say ""Dyche will see us to safety"" but 11 points out of 12 from the easiest run we've had in years (and the easiest run anyone had this season) tells me otherwise. Think people have this notion that Dyche is incapable of relegation when the only thing that's stopped it from happening is Burnley sacking him. Think it's a pisstake saying it's an easy run when we're worse than these so-called easy teams. December looms"
3921,Everton,He’s a absolute dinosaur and I’m sick of his footy but no way he gets sacked before the end of the season  Dan and Ryan Friedkin want you to hold their beers 🍻 I don't see any way things get better if we sack him right before the busiest time of the season. I can see sacking him near the end of the season if we're comfortably safe but only because the bottom three are that bad. 
3922,Everton,"Dyche is neither the immediate problem nor the long term solution. 

He is our Nanny McPhee. He’s here because he’s needed, even if he’s not wanted. The moment he’s no longer needed, he will turn into a beautiful woman and vanish without a trace. >He is our Nanny McPhee. He’s here because he’s needed, even if he’s not wanted.

Lovely comment! Wish he could turn into a football manager.  Like Smith?"
3923,Everton,"Defensively I see your point but offensively it's not good enough 

We aren't offering each other support on the attack we lack the last cross and we keep trying to feed one player and whenever we do find our LW, RW or number 10 it's either at the keepers gut or we overthink it or it we delay the shot it's not good enough I'm sick of the same story being written when it comes to lack of goals "
3924,Everton,No fire another one. And again next year when dcl and McNeil don't light up the league with goals. Dcl again next year??? Haven't we suffered enough?
3925,Everton,There's not a man alive that could get these players playing exciting fluid football. They struggle pass the ball ten yards under minimal pressure Ancelotti coffs with a raised eyebrow 
3926,Everton,"Yep, I’m on board.

The question in these situations shouldn’t be ‘should we sack the manager’, rather ‘who can we get that’s better?’

Given our current predicament, other than a new manger bounce, who is out there?

I’d take Big Dunc back in an emergency, but we aren’t there yet. We’re still three places above relegation. Dyche will keep us up imo. I don’t care if that means we finish 17th.

Lee Carsley? I’d take him if he’ll come. I’d be interested in Lee taking over at some point."
3927,Everton,"Well you're about to be disappointed when we're in relegation zone by new year. Can't win shit in our easiest run of games and it's about to get worse. 

Other than his cross and inshallah tactics his coaching has to be questioned as well. Why have we struggled so much to score from set-piece when it was our main strength last year? Why has everyone been struggling to find form this season? Why does he keep picking Doucoure? "
3928,Everton,"It has to be Dyche in for now. Until the takeover happens it wouldn't be financially prudent to make any moves.

If it fails again, we will need Dyche to keep this bunch of players in the league. As rubbish as it is right now. We are in a bubble until...

New Owner, New Manager, New Stadium. For me it has to be in that order "
3929,Everton,"You’re cracked. People paying 50 quid to watch this utter drivel? How can you expect us to score when we’re set up to draw every game, Brentford down to 10 men and couldn’t have looked more comfortable. 11 points in 12 games is pathetic, especially considering the fixtures, he will not keep us up. I just hope he’s gone before January so he can’t do anymore damage. The managers negativity towards football has completely decimated our attacking players morale, if he infect N’diaye as well we’re finished. And we blame the board for a lack of ambition. 


These fans are happy avoiding relegation every year. 


Future is bleak. "
3930,Everton,"This. he is driving me bonkers at the moment, but we can't keep rinse and repeat expecting better results (with the financial constraints right now). We have to rinse later, we cant bathe right now. We have to suck it up for a little bit longer, and when new ownership steps in we are good to go. "
3931,Everton,"I don't mean this as a dig but you can tell most saying Dyche In aren't match goers. It's become a truly miserable experience. I don‘t think anyone‘s saying we‘re playing beautiful football at the moment. The point is rather that we’ve spent almost nothing for the last few years and are a complete shambles at board level. Dyche isn‘t really our main problem, he‘s working with what he‘s got"
3932,Everton,It's definitely the manager 
3933,Everton,"Players don't look like they're having him. 

The football (if you can call it that?) is the worst I've ever seen. 

He constantly plays his favourites when there are better options on the bench. 

He's slapped a player. 

He's gone after thet fans this season. Twice. 

He has no plan B. 

His tactics are a joke. 

His subs are a joke. 

His game management is a joke. 

He can't get them scoring.

He can barely get them to defend. 

He's a patchy-at-best manager who has well more bad patches than good. 

And he's just fucking crap. 

I'm in the Dyche Out camp. Firmly. "
3934,Everton,Everton reddit has the lowest standard of football understanding and opinion 
3935,Everton,So you’re okay with this shite? 2 wins in 12 games with the easiest fixtures of the season. Glad to see the media have made your standards low. 
3936,Everton,"McNeil and Lindstrom couldn't put a cross in to save their lives today and somehow people are putting our lack of chances on dyche. His system is set up to get wingers the ball in space to cross it, and it worked perfectly until it was actually time to put in a dangerous cross. Kinda crazy that people can't recognize that. Maybe we shouldn't just cross and inshallah then as our attacking set up McNeil wasn't even playing winger today, fyi"
3937,Everton," Can’t wait till he’s sacked

Awful manager Blokes a fucking fossil"
3938,Everton,"Sorry - dyche is anti football. He starts with the mentality of not getting beat but we do, not won in ages,striker in a poor run of form - play Everton and that statistic is addressed.

We are better than Dyche sets up. The players have to stick to his script. If they try to win and we get beat fine. But the team isn’t setup right.

Today against Brentford for instance. Ashley Young swings it in from the right to the far post - that’s it.  What does he do all week with the players, it’s a team of 11 individuals not a cohesive unit.  They don’t fight for each other. He plays the same side.  He doesn’t trust youth. DCL is isolated at least Beto wants it and cares.

It’s obvious Dyche has target 38 points and no more. The players weren’t fit for Brighton or Bournemouth, Seamus had a go so we beat palace and then went back to type after the goal. Today see above - didn’t try to beat 10 men.

Steve Stone he played for England what does he think.  Why are we always last on match of the day cos it’s boring.  I’m sick of being gaslit by Sean.

Thanks but no thanks.  Carsley for me. "
3939,Everton,"This is a weird post because you effectivley saying both cant co-exist. Yes we have major ownership issues and lack of current spending money, and yes we have a manager who has apparently ran out of ideas. Just because the ownership issue isn't solved yet doesn't mean we cant try and fix the manager issue. 

The takeover is hopefully weeks away from finishing and the new owners should be coming in and looking to change almost immediately, they know it has to change. You don't buy a new premier league club and hope the already sinking ship manages to get to harbor, you start work fixing quickly!

Hopefully the books are balanced enough that Freidkins can bring a couple of capable players in during January window (i know this is a hard task). But they definitely can breathe life into the squad with a new manager and finally get these decent enough players to play football!

  
Dyche did an amazing job saving us last season, i will always thank him for that. But the words he chooses to use now are evidence enough he's had enough. Change is needed, were almost ashore, lets just get there aye? "
3940,Everton,Looks like Toffee TV have destabilised the club again. 
3941,Everton,😄👎 
3942,Everton,">Dyche was contracted to keep us alive until finances are sorted

Got that in writing? "
3943,Everton,"Can't see him lasting past the point when there's someone in place to sack him and bring in a replacement.

That won't happen until the takeover is completed and TFG bring in their own people to run the club at board level. 

Hopefully sooner rather than later. "
3944,Everton,"By the new year’s Intl Break, we will likely be 19th in the table with new owners who will look to bring in a new manager and maybe a player or two.  No need to be calling for a new manager, or defending the current one while the team is devoid of any leadership at the board level. Nothing will change until the sale is complete. "
3945,Everton,"The Buck stops with the manager. Always has. It’s a results business and if you don’t get results, you’re out. He needs to go. That’s Brentford draw was abysmal. "
3946,Everton,"In, out, in, out, shake it all about "
3947,Everton,"too right Dyche is the man nobody can get a tune out of DCL, Young Dacoure hes hamstrung, with fineer braver players hed be lauded, imagine Klopp here before going to redshite, we'd be in the 1st division never mind the championship, not another person on earth could of saved us after that useless Lampard except Dyche and the toxicity towards him is un evertonian and a disgrace "
3948,Everton,One of the worst threads IV seen for a long time 
3949,Everton,Spent 15k through work to secure 2 lounge season tickets for bramley Moore (had to commit to 3 seasons) and I'm not even excited about it. Fair play! My Dad and I looked at them but just couldn’t justify it for 3 years minimum commitment. Wish we could have done. Hopefully next season will see some changes and there will be more to be excited about.
3950,Everton,"I’m not quite Dyche out yet, and I think he did a good job given the challenging circumstances, but this is starting to get worrying now.

We’ve been a mid table side since Carlo left and I thought Dyche could achieve that given our points total last year but his is getting pretty bad now. > We’ve been a mid table side since Carlo left

What have you been smoking?"
3951,Everton,"You're living in fantasy land buddy. 

We're averaging less than 1 point per game from the easiest opening 12 games we could get. Now we've got 6 ridiculous games coming up. You think we're gonna pick up wins at Man City away?

It wouldn't matter if we had Haaland up front. The problem is Dyche. He's not got a clue about attacking football and the only reason we were safe the past season, was we scored so many goals from set pieces. They've dried up because teams got wise to our tactics. "
3952,Everton,"The club is a shambles operationally but Dyche surely has input in transfers and under him they have been poor, in the context of not focussing on key positionsn 3rd worst goals scored last season, 3rd best defence…therefore buy a defender and don’t play him?! 

The DCL situation on and off the pitch is a shambles, Beto not good enough! Won’t use Ndiaye in attacking mid! 

Today was different in the stats also but our possession and shots on target are usually dire! 

This has got to be his last season at Everton! It can’t go on like this! "
3953,Everton,Dyche will be gone by February. 
3954,Everton,"It’s not really a debate. He should be sacked, but won’t be. 

So I’m in the “Dyche stasis” camp. He’s hard fucking work to like "
3955,Everton,Shut up Ian. Goosfraba
3956,Everton,Every club has called for the head of their last 29 managers.... 
3957,Everton,"Dyche needs to switch to a 3421 where we can keep both ndiaye and McNeil/Lindstrøm central and have better control of midfield Dyche won't do that.  I'm with you though: https://www.reddit.com/r/Everton/comments/1grpsgl/daily_discussion/lxblunj/

Could play Harrison in that lineup without needing a new addition.  

That lineup was more January or next season so DCL would be playing for now instead of Chermiti.  Mangala would be in instead of Tim.  Not optimal that as of now Mangala won't be here next season so we wouldn't be investing our future, rather just trying to scrape by and not get relegated in the immediate."
3958,Everton,You must fuckin love the thought of relegation 
3959,Everton,"With the takeover we are not in financial shambles.

And even pre-takeover we still aren't in such financial woes that we couldn't afford to pay off Dyche & his staff and hire someone new. The takeover that hasn't even been finalized yet? At the club that's bailing the water of 6 previous managers? Last I heard if the takeover doesn’t happen before Xmas we will be seriously considering any offers that come in for players"
3960,Everton,"Dyche is a terrible manager but...

The players suck
Management sucks
Owner sucks

Just a shambles of a club and im embarrassed to be a fan right now.  My 2011 boys team are all confused on why the hell I would be an Everton fan "
3961,Everton,"Hahahahahanabahahahh 

American? "
3962,Everton,Seems like there's a bit of respect between Everton and Man United in this situation 🤝. P.s. I hope we batter you next week and you have to make the same post again 👍 
3963,Everton,"But he's not doing your second sentence. 

By the New Year, we'll be bottom; mark my words. "
3964,Everton,"Think people have this notion that Dyche is incapable of relegation when the only thing that's stopped it from happening is Burnley sacking him. Dyche has been relegated, also with Burnley, before he got them back up and stabilised for many years before he was sacked the season they went down. Dyche was relegated once and then sacked shortly before Burnley were relegated.  Dyche's Burnley were in a bad spot and that's why he was relieved and they were relegated.  His next job was us.

Dyche was imperfect after he first came on but in the end he did save the season and was better than Lampard.  I wanted Domenico Tedesco instead though who was available at the time and saved a team from relegation in his very first job, taking over a team that looked all but sunk.  Tedesco was someone who I felt the club could have built with.

Dyche only ever made sense to me as an until the end of the season hire but he was hired for 2.5 seasons instead of half a season."
3965,Everton,"Think it's a pisstake saying it's an easy run when we're worse than these so-called easy teams. Well welcome to December then...because it's going to be a bloodbath...wish we were playing city sooner We’ve played 8 of the bottom 11, 5 of them at home. How much easier do you want it to be? No such thing as an easy run, but there is such thing as an easiest run. Brentford hadn’t had any away points prior to this draw as they had trips to Liverpool, Man C, Spurs, Man U and Fulham, taking leads in all but the first of these, often within a minute. They are also great scorers at home too, so this is not easy. Away to West Ham certainly wasn’t. Plus it means Everton have shut out the 3 best attacking teams outside the big 6 since October (Ipswich, Newcastle and Brentford). Dyche is comparable to Walter Smith. Good defensive team but poor attack (and even he had Campbell and Jeffers/Radzinski) and trying to manage a team who was on the rocks financially and getting safety point by point whilst also stabilising them off the pitch Southampton hadn't won a game and Brentford had 0 points away from home before today. If they aren't the easiest games we could have then there's no such thing as an easy run - in which case we have to be considered relegation contenders regardless It's an easier run compared to other teams like Wolves who played most of the top6 THIS!!! I haven’t been confident when we play “easy teams” for about 3 seasons now!"
3966,Everton,December looms 
3967,Everton,Dan and Ryan Friedkin want you to hold their beers 🍻 
3968,Everton,I don't see any way things get better if we sack him right before the busiest time of the season. I can see sacking him near the end of the season if we're comfortably safe but only because the bottom three are that bad.

3972,Everton,Dcl again next year??? Haven't we suffered enough? Half this sub will lynch you for wanting him gone
3973,Everton,"Ancelotti coffs with a raised eyebrow  Ancelotti had far better players tbh, richarlison, bernard, James Rodriguez, Lucas digne etc are all technical footballers who can pass and progress the ball. Even someone like Andre Gomes who wasn’t perfect as a player was still technically solid on the ball and could pass Ancellotti didn't have this squad "
3974,Everton,I’d be interested in Lee taking over at some point. 
3975,Everton,"And we blame the board for a lack of ambition. 


These fans are happy avoiding relegation every year. 


Future is bleak.  Happy with avoiding relegation considering our club is Bankrupt, yes. The fact we're still in the league when each of the last 3 seasons we've run a big transfer surplus when every other team is spending and improving is a miracle in itself.

Of course, if Friedkin opens the cheque book and things don't change, then I'll start to have issues."
3976,Everton,"I don‘t think anyone‘s saying we‘re playing beautiful football at the moment. The point is rather that we’ve spent almost nothing for the last few years and are a complete shambles at board level. Dyche isn‘t really our main problem, he‘s working with what he‘s got > Dyche isn‘t really our main problem, he‘s working with what he‘s got

I think the point is that he's not doing well with what he's got. He's not making the best use of limited resources, he doesn't manage in-game situations well, he often gets his first 11 and subs wrong, and he's not getting the most from the squad he has. All of this can be true even from within the context of the club's issues."
3977,Everton,"Maybe we shouldn't just cross and inshallah then as our attacking set up We have two of the best rated headers of the ball as our center backs and a striker with one of the best leaps in the whole prem, with (theoretically) one of the better left footed crossers in the league......

Couldnt get a single corner kick right today but somehow it's down to tactics? He even went two up top like everyone in this sub screams for and we still couldn't deliver a halfway decent ball"
3978,Everton,"McNeil wasn't even playing winger today, fyi Say you didn’t watch the game without saying you didn’t watch the game. Yes but he frequently drifted wide to deliver crosses and was on every corner kick and i could probably count on one hand the number of crosses that were halfway decent Dyche moved him out there at the start of the second half and put Ndiaye in the 10 role. Shows what he knows though because McMessi doesn’t have the pace or trickery to play wide. He’s better playing centrally where he can play through balls or take a shot. So, assuming our glorious leader can see the same thing why did he make the swap? Couldn’t he have brought Beto on for Doucoure or Lindstrom and given the Brentford defence something more to worry about? He waited until the 70 odd minute to do it. He was more worried about losing a goal than he was excited about the increased chance of scoring a few. Did you not watch the game?"
3979,Everton,Blokes a fucking fossil 
3980,Everton,"Fair play! My Dad and I looked at them but just couldn’t justify it for 3 years minimum commitment. Wish we could have done. Hopefully next season will see some changes and there will be more to be excited about. Yeah I didn't mean to sound massively ungrateful lol, I am looking forward to it but it just doesn't seem worth that kind of money right now.

Got a few people we do work for that are Everton fans so will come in handy for keeping suppliers happy."
3981,Everton,"> We’ve been a mid table side since Carlo left

What have you been smoking? Quality wise we’ve been good enough to finish at least 14th every season.  Appointing Rafa was short sighted and destroyed any good will with the board.  Then Lampard took us to a whole new level of misery as he simply isn’t cut out for management.  Last season’s points tally was where we should have been all along."
3982,Everton,Goosfraba 
3983,Everton,"Dyche won't do that.  I'm with you though: https://www.reddit.com/r/Everton/comments/1grpsgl/daily_discussion/lxblunj/

Could play Harrison in that lineup without needing a new addition.  

That lineup was more January or next season so DCL would be playing for now instead of Chermiti.  Mangala would be in instead of Tim.  Not optimal that as of now Mangala won't be here next season so we wouldn't be investing our future, rather just trying to scrape by and not get relegated in the immediate. "
3984,Everton,The takeover that hasn't even been finalized yet? At the club that's bailing the water of 6 previous managers? intents The takeover is basically done and will be completed by the january window. For all intends and purposes our new owners are making the decisions now.
3985,Everton,"Last I heard if the takeover doesn’t happen before Xmas we will be seriously considering any offers that come in for players Dyche has said this.

If it doesn’t happen before the window anyone could go including Jared."
3986,Everton,"Dyche has been relegated, also with Burnley, before he got them back up and stabilised for many years before he was sacked the season they went down. "
3987,Everton,"Dyche was relegated once and then sacked shortly before Burnley were relegated.  Dyche's Burnley were in a bad spot and that's why he was relieved and they were relegated.  His next job was us.

Dyche was imperfect after he first came on but in the end he did save the season and was better than Lampard.  I wanted Domenico Tedesco instead though who was available at the time and saved a team from relegation in his very first job, taking over a team that looked all but sunk.  Tedesco was someone who I felt the club could have built with.

Dyche only ever made sense to me as an until the end of the season hire but he was hired for 2.5 seasons instead of half a season. It always makes me laugh that Dyche is called better than Lampard, given that Lampard kept us up over Dyche’s Burnley.

They’re both poor, but I genuinely think Lampard wanted to succeed at Everton, he just wasn’t capable of it. Dyche behaves as if he is succeeding, and - crucially at this stage - is now complaining about being unable to spend his way out of trouble. Tick tock, Sean."
3988,Everton,Well welcome to December then...because it's going to be a bloodbath...wish we were playing city sooner Yep. Going to get reeeeeally fucking real for Sean over the next few weeks.

3991,Everton,"Brentford hadn’t had any away points prior to this draw as they had trips to Liverpool, Man C, Spurs, Man U and Fulham, taking leads in all but the first of these, often within a minute. They are also great scorers at home too, so this is not easy. Away to West Ham certainly wasn’t. Plus it means Everton have shut out the 3 best attacking teams outside the big 6 since October (Ipswich, Newcastle and Brentford). Dyche is comparable to Walter Smith. Good defensive team but poor attack (and even he had Campbell and Jeffers/Radzinski) and trying to manage a team who was on the rocks financially and getting safety point by point whilst also stabilising them off the pitch I’ll preface this by saying I’m a novice soccer fan, but we are also two or three defensive bed-shirtings away from being in the middle of the table. It’s an uphill climb still for sure though."
3992,Everton,"Southampton hadn't won a game and Brentford had 0 points away from home before today. If they aren't the easiest games we could have then there's no such thing as an easy run - in which case we have to be considered relegation contenders regardless Southampton look like the only team set for relegation and the other two spots are TBD.  Of course we gave Southampton their only win.

A lot of this sub may have turned on Dyche but I see him getting until January and when the new ownership comes in."

3996,Everton,"Ancelotti had far better players tbh, richarlison, bernard, James Rodriguez, Lucas digne etc are all technical footballers who can pass and progress the ball. Even someone like Andre Gomes who wasn’t perfect as a player was still technically solid on the ball and could pass Then let's look at DCLs record under Ancelotti.


Manage players and play to their strengths. Dyche plays to when he knows. Lump it forward. "
3997,Everton,"Ancellotti didn't have this squad  Yeah we've run hundreds of millions of transfer surplus since Ancelloti 😅 Ancelloti would still do much more with this squad.

Look at DCLs record under Ancelloti. He isn't a bad player, its the manager that makes the player."
3998,Everton,"Happy with avoiding relegation considering our club is Bankrupt, yes. The fact we're still in the league when each of the last 3 seasons we've run a big transfer surplus when every other team is spending and improving is a miracle in itself.

Of course, if Friedkin opens the cheque book and things don't change, then I'll start to have issues. "
3999,Everton,"> Dyche isn‘t really our main problem, he‘s working with what he‘s got

I think the point is that he's not doing well with what he's got. He's not making the best use of limited resources, he doesn't manage in-game situations well, he often gets his first 11 and subs wrong, and he's not getting the most from the squad he has. All of this can be true even from within the context of the club's issues. I agree there‘s probably better managers out there for us, but any new manager would be a gamble and we‘re already dangerously close to Relegation. At least with Dyche we know what we‘re getting and that he has the ability to keep everything stable.

I personally think he‘s suffering from the insecurity of not knowing wether he‘ll get renewed or not"
4000,Everton,"We have two of the best rated headers of the ball as our center backs and a striker with one of the best leaps in the whole prem, with (theoretically) one of the better left footed crossers in the league......

He even went two up top like everyone in this sub screams for and we still couldn't deliver a halfway decent ball He went 2 up top and went all about crosses, against a team that was a man down and happy to defend like that. 

That's on the tactics more than it is on the players"
4001,Everton,"Say you didn’t watch the game without saying you didn’t watch the game. He wasn't playing winger. He was drifting wide from his central position.

Sorry, but I don't get this. Just following what you've offered here, we know what we're getting with Dyche, and what we're getting with Dyche is ""already dangerously close to Relegation"". Logically, that means it's quite a gamble to keep Dyche as well. History proves that he's certainly not immune from relegation, if that's what's being suggested.

> I personally think he‘s suffering from the insecurity of not knowing wether he‘ll get renewed or not

Well he should be able to sleep tight then, because there's no way he's getting another contract at this club. A large chunk of the fanbase finds the football on display unacceptable, and his petty, arrogant, contradictory, defensive statements in press conferences annoying. He hasn't really endeared himself to the fanbase as a personality. He hasn't really tried to make such a connection, so I don't think many will shed a tear when he goes. Couple that with the Friedkins obviously having higher standards and lower patience, the best case scenario for Dyche is he finishes out his contract. He's one of the highest-paid managers in Europe, and there's no reason that should continue to be true past this season."
4020,Everton,"3 games he's lost 4-0 with city us, Barcelona and Spurs and once with Bayern against Real Madrid. "
4021,Everton,"I was disappointed when the 4th goal went in as I knew the record had been equalled.
Still, to hold the record in the premier league for 7 and a half years is impressive and shows how consistent Man City were after this match. "

4023,Everton,Great thanks for that. 
4024,Everton,"We've mishandled a lot of young player development, but Tom Davies has to be right up there for me. 

There was a good player in there. He was captaining England U19s. It's a joke that not only did he regress, but we didn't even manage to sell him on. 5 positions under 7 managers. 

We're awful at developing players, we only ever seem to sell raw talent. Branthwaite has kicked on massively but that was after a year at PSV. Davies would do the job Doucoure is being asked to do better imo."
4025,Everton,My first match at goodison 
4026,Everton,I was there that day. Frightening that a team with Tom Davies in it is an order of magnitude better than the team today.

4028,Everton,"5 positions under 7 managers. 

We're awful at developing players, we only ever seem to sell raw talent. Branthwaite has kicked on massively but that was after a year at PSV. "
4029,Everton,Davies would do the job Doucoure is being asked to do better imo. 
4030,Everton,Watching this team try to score is torture 
4031,Everton,"He's not going anywhere. He will continue with his 1 PPG average until the end of the season, see us safe, and the Friedkins will come in and bring in their new manager in the summer. 

We will all be miserable this season, but there's nothing that can be done. We will have at best 13 points from 19 games so that PPG is dropping TFG will fuck him off I see you're in the denial stage Lad if you think Dyche is keeping us safe you must be watching the games with your eyes closed Dyche is not keeping us safe mate, have you been watching the games? Hopefully. But they will come hopefully in January and then he gets the sack tho, I’d be shocked if they wait the whole season He’s done assuming the takeover concludes. If TFG get the nod he gets the Spanish fiddler."
4032,Everton,"As long as we look like we are staying up he will be kept in.

He’s going in the summer and the new owners will pick there new man. The only way he is going is if we are in real relegation trouble. We're not going to look like staying up for long. All of the current top 8 plus Man U, Wolves and Bournemouth in are next 11 games. Will be surprised if we take 6 points."
4033,Everton,"I’m not saying you’re wrong, I’m just wondering what else could have been done. The quality is the quality to a certain extent.  He put in Beto & kept DCL on.  Maybe keep lindstrom and drop McNeil, but honestly this team doesn’t have finishers. 71 shots in our last 4 games and we’ve scored 1 goal. He’s not great but the players simply aren’t good enough either That's what those Dyche outers don't get. Who would get these players to become scoring machines? The only way to attempt to score is by shooting a lot. Eventually it will result in a goal. If it's only about players then why do any teams bother with coaches at all? A different coach would flip the mentality and hopefully bring in some 21st century coaching methods. Comments like this are evidence that, after 4 years of crap managers, people have forgotten what a manager is meant to do. A good manager improves players. A good manager drills patterns of play in training. A good manager actually has the imagination and ambition to say, ""when we're in this situation, this is what we'll do to try to get the ball into the box and score a goal"", then actually implements a strategy aimed towards that. A good manager takes the resources he has available to him and develops a competent way of playing that gets the best out of whatever players he has. You'd have a tough time arguing that Dyche is doing any of this.

But ""what else could he have done"" at home against the 10 mighty men of Brentford is the conversations we're stuck in. He could’ve brought Beto on for Doucoure or Lindstrom at HT. 

Instead, he moved McMessi out to the left where he’s ineffective. 

Then he brings Beto on for Lindstrom after 70 odd mins. We created some half chances but doing it for 45 mins instead of 20 mins would have increased our chance of scoring. 

Frank was trying to win the game with 10 men. Dyche was trying not to lose it with 11. We don’t have the offensive talent to be an offensive team. DCL appears to have had 1-1,5 great seasons and now is just not good enough to get it done. Beto is better off the bench imo. 

Dyche can’t make Gana, Doucs, Dwight, or whoever suddenly score 2 a game from the box if his strikers aren’t either. Lindstrom has been our worst attacker for weeks, he's absolutely clueless in the final third The fact that our opposition keepers always seem to know exactly what our attackers are going to do and where they‘re going to shoot is getting depressing. They‘re way too predictable  A better manager gets more quality out of the same players. Players' quality isn't a rigid inflexible quantity, else what would be the point of a manager other than team selection? 
Some people know how to get the best out of players (carlo and DCL for example), I don't think dyche knows how to get the best out of any of this lot."
4034,Everton,"1 loss in the last 8 games. 6 scored, 4 conceded. We’re not scoring but we’re also not conceding. When our only aim is to survive again and be a prem side going into the new stadium he’s achieving the goal. He’s going nowhere. Yes but take a look at those 8 teams, and then take a look at the next 8! We’ve needed wins, and he doesn’t know how to win games"
4035,Everton,"It’s the players at this point.

The chances are there, the quality is not. Man has had 0 money to spend. He’s not a miracle worker. He can’t finish the shots for the attackers. This sentiment is crazy. It doesn’t look good but I don’t know if a manager alive could do anything with this group"
4036,Everton,"Do you agree this is Walter Smith 2.0?
Inherits the team at a very low ebb results-wise and financially, and gets them to combat-pragmatist nil-nil draws which are enough to get points on the board to clear danger but not exactly win plaudits, whilst helping them stabilise financially, hopefully for the next boss to be the new Moyes. On one hand, sad that Everton failed to break down 10 men, but on the other hand, it was great that the best attack outside the big 5 (whose hitherto lack of points away from home was due to tough matches, many of which they scored in the first minute in) didn’t lay a glove on Everton, and Branthwaite will only get more credit if that resilience continues "
4037,Everton,Yes from me after 60 odd minutes today I didn’t care if it was a draw I just wanted it over What would your tactics have been to breakdown a team defending with ten men in the box? I’m genuinely interested.
4038,Everton,"We have the best defensive form in the league the past 8 games. 

The problem is we lack solid creative output. 

Dyche wants us to play a high-paced attacking game, which means quick decision making to expose gaps in the final third, and utilize a high press when necessary to force turnovers in dangerous areas, while staying organized defensively to prevent getting caught on the break when we do so. 

I think most fans prefer that style of play over a more possession-heavy style, judging by the groans and boos in the crowd whenever someone dares play a pass back to a center back or to Pickford. 

But you can’t just coach imagination. We don’t have a catalyst right now who is gelling consistently right now with our forward players, who can visualize 2 or 3 passes ahead in an instant, or when a player does, the others are not on the same wavelength.

That said, he’s made us hard to beat. And we need to understand that we were never *not* going to be in another relegation fight this year. We’ve had to play it conservative in transfers for years and while there is light at the end of the tunnel, we are *still* in the tunnel.

Now, I’ve gone back ten years; I could not find a single team relegated who averaged less than one goal conceded per match. However, plenty of teams stayed up who *scored* less than a goal per match. 

In other words, Dyche is prioritizing correctly. The most important thing is being solid defensively. Our attacking troubles will most likely require another transfer window or two to be solved. I’ve had to read the first sentence in the third paragraph about 10 times. What?"
4039,Everton,"While I completely agree, we need to let Dyche see this season out. 

We've been thru too many managers mid season in the past.  

Dyche is a relegation avoiding master.  But that's all he really is. 

I don't see Dyche ever really finishing anywhere but 14-17th. 

He had a clear job to do...avoid relegation.  And that's what he's done successfully (so far). 


We need someone with *modern* tactics and with some balls willing to make a change and develop a style of play other than just old school park the bus kick and run. 

We have some quality and creativity in the squad in Ndiaye and McNeil.  

DCL needs out, Dyche needs out, we need a RW and a ST. We need...alot. 

But I think starting with Dyche isn't a bad thing this summer.  We could use a fresh view and some new tactics, that's for sure. "
4040,Everton,"Right we need a progressive coach 25 shots isn't enough. We need 45. How many clear cut chances did Everton create today? 

Brentford created better chances with 10 men than we did with 11 today. Frank was trying to win the game. Dyche was trying not to lose it."
4041,Everton,"not being funny but we played well, its not dyches fault we cant finish What chances are you referring to? I just came back from the game and would argue Brentford had more clear cut chances, E.g the wissa one. Just looked at the xg also and we had 1.15 and they had 1.08, with a man sent off of course. If you seriously believe we played well there your standards have been dragged through the floor. "
4042,Everton,"Time to go. 10 goals on the season. 0 in the last 3 games. Fuck outta here. 7 league wins in just over 11 months. We almost had 30 shots. What else does a coach need to do. If we got pep it doesn't change the fact that Dom can't finish a sandwich.

McNeil will never cap for the country and he is our biggest threat.

Yall wanna play a progressive style like we attempted with frank lampared but we have one of the least threatening attacking front in the league. Dyche looks st the bench to see 0 goal 0 assist Jack harrison as a good option.

Yall want dyche to play tiki taca with guys like myko who have 2 weak foot. [deleted]"
4043,Everton,Cool man.  Thanks for sharing your feelings. 
4044,Everton,"We’re not sacking him. We can’t afford to pay him off when he has 6 months left. No one wants to come in and manage the team with the run of fixtures we have, coupled with a pending new ownership who is likely to want their own man once they take over. 

Also all these people who want him out have no ideas for who to replace him. “That’s not my job”. Oh so you just want to moan? "
4045,Everton,27 shots and only 5 on target against 10 men just makes you think what’s are they doing all week in training. Abysmal 
4046,Everton,"It’s almost like we sell our best players every year and sign players from europes bargain bins

Cheapest squad in the premier league. What the fuck do you lot expect "
4047,Everton,Dyche told the players to waste the chances today 
4048,Everton,"Who would you bring in?

Why would you want a new manager to have the run of games we have coming up?

Who would sack him? Not the supporters’ job to do the search and hire 🤷🏼‍♂️ However, it IS the supporters’ job to decide they’re done supporting him."
4049,Everton,"As I said before. He will not go anywhere until the end of the season. Friedkin doesn't have full control, and Moshiri isn't paying for it. Simple as. "
4050,Everton,"There's no one to make the decision to fire him. And probably no money to pay him off.

I get that people are angry and this season has been shit so far. But if there's any shred of optimism, it's the fact that Branthwaite is back, and lo and behold we've stopped conceding goals. We built momentum last season on that basis, shutting teams out builds confidence, it takes one scrappy goal or someone like McNeil or Ndiaye catching one right and suddenly you have a win and momentum builds.

Yeah we should have beaten Brentford today and the run of fixtures we've got is pretty terrifying. But it is what it is, all that matters until the club is sold is not getting relegated. I don't see that happening under Dyche, and until the takeover goes through it's pretty pointless wishing otherwise. "
4051,Everton,"We've been mostly pants and calling for the head of the manager since Roberto's final season. 


 10 years of meh....the most crushingly poor period of Everton since relegation back in the 1950's, and arguably the longest in our 150-year history.   Even the 90's had the odd bright spot (not least the FA Cup, and a few enjoyable derby games). 


 Dyche out is just the same thing as Lampard out, Benitez out, Silva out, Allardyce out, Koeman out, Roberto out etc etc. 


 We've had more managers these last 10 years than in the previous 40.  Something is very wrong and it coincides with Moshiri's era....which with any luck we can finally put behind us soon. "
4052,Everton,"Where's the 'stability' brigade??? Probably don't feel like getting downvoted by a bunch of angry fans looking to argue Here. I'm the stability brigade. Everyone screams for our manager to be sacked and I've just heard the same thing since Martinez other than ancelotti.

The team is shite from top to bottom regardless of what manager we have.

Our best players have had to be sold in recent seasons because of moshri and the recruitment he approved when George Mendez had his ear flogging us the shite he couldn't get rid of anywhere else causing us to overspend and throw mad wages at players.

I wouldn't be sad to see the back of dyche but if we binned him off today we'd be screaming to sack the next manager in 2 months unless something fundamentally changes at the club.

Hoping the new owners actually pull through and do something but if not we're gonna tumble down the leagues like Sunderland did."
4053,Everton,He’s about till his contract runs out then it’s “Everton Football Club would like to thank Shaun for all his hard work and we wish him well for the future” 
4054,Everton,"He's one shit, limited, one dimensional dinosaur of a manager "
4055,Everton,"Is it poor/unimaginative tactics or just uninspired play? The way we played yesterday we‘re going to lose every game in this next run.

 I don’t think they hate losing enough. You can put that on Dyche, but a lot of it is on the players. I want players that walk off the pitch mad at themselves. I don’t see that.

Bench DCL and start Beto. "
4056,Everton,"It’s funny how everyone’s screaming Dyche out but I was downvoted to fuck for saying the writing’s on the wall since Bournemouth. He’s not a good football manager. He has one single idea and that works only when it frustrates your opponent. We will now keep him for the next run of games and he will either get more points from those than he has from other games or he has to go, otherwise we’re in deep shit. "
4057,Everton,"He should have been out over the summer. This team is pathetic with him in charge. We've been pathetic for 5 years, and that's being generous Why would Everton have sacked him during the summer with an absent owner, and amassing 47 pts in a season where we had 2 pts deductions? Everton have been pathetic for a long time my friend"
4058,Everton,Won’t happen until the takeover is completed at least 
4059,Everton,"Happy with a point at home against 10 men when we've got a twat of a run coming up?

He's a horrendous manager and he looks out of his depth at every level. 

I would've binned him after last season as we all saw this coming. 

Joke of a manager. "
4060,Everton,"Sooner him and his coaching staff are gone the better for everyone. It's not working. Beaten twice by Southampton (who are rubbish), goalless bore draws against West Ham & Brentford. The most boring football ever imaginable. Cldnt score in a brothel this team. Done well to keep us up first two seasons. Kudos for that. But you can't live on your past. You have to progress. We haven't. So as soon as takeover sorted bye bye Sean I hope. And take Woan and Stone with you. "
4061,Everton,"I’ve been firmly Dyche-in until recently but it’s mounting up against him now:
- I feel like we’re sleepwalking into trouble with the fixtures we have coming up. 
- I can’t abide his press conferences now. His level of deflection is becoming irritating at best but leaning towards infuriating. 
- Calling out the fans is neither warranted or acceptable, he keeps doing it, crying poverty about “this is what Everton is like”. The cheeky bastard, these fans have walked over coals for him and the team in the past. But now it’s going down the shitter he’s pointing fingers and rolling his eyes. When you’ve already lost the majority of the fan base, calling them out will only help to make that majority greater. 
- He doesn’t refer to Everton as ‘us’. He’s not connected and his tone is clear that it’s an us and them mentality.  Feels almost as disconnected as Koeman to me. 
- Players like Branthwaite and Ndiaye must hate playing for him. We know DCL does and I fear the longer he stays, the more will want to leave. 
- The football has never been great but it is getting progressively worse. The rot has set in. 
- Youth has absolutely no chance under this manager. 
- His reluctance to change the team, system or shape makes him a dream for most managers to play against. Predictability makes us easy to set up against. 

My preference was always to let him see out his contract and to have the reset of all resets in the summer. I’m an eternal optimist but even I’m on the turn and getting concerned now. "
4062,Everton,"100% agree, he's a dinosaur, awful tactics just awful. And those December fixtures, we'll be in the bottom 3 by New Year. "
4063,Everton,"Might as well let him have the tough December games that we're getting nothing from anyway, he might manage to scrape a point from one of them. 

We should absolutely be looking for a new manager now though. Problem is, who is making that decision? I doubt anything would happen until the Friedkin takeover is complete. Let's not let him have the tough December games, because now we need the points from them because he's wasted the easy games. This. Nothing is going to happen until the takeover goes through. Moshiri isn't going to (or able to) stump up a bit of cash for getting rid of Dyche. Even if it won't be a huge amount due to his contract running out in the summer. He's sold us, no way he's paying anything over and above the bare minimum he has to"
4064,Everton,"""First half we were very good. Second half it was flat. The stadium gets nervous. It was difficult today."" - Dyche

It's flat because you can't organise a fucking attack majority of the games you have been here. If he's starting to put blame on the fans he can fuck off right now he's never getting a bigger job than this, it's not our fault your shite football isn't anything to get us off our arses. "
4065,Everton,Worst manager in the league. He would suck a dick for 38 nil-nil draws 
4066,Everton,"Assuming TFG are in by the end of the year, I think the only way he keeps his job is 3 wins between now and January, as those fixtures are horrible. "
4067,Everton,85th minute subs ftw lol 😂 
4068,Everton,"I hosted a watchalong for that 💩 yesterday, was torture trying to be excited or angry at players looking gassed with a man advantage, devoid of ideas while unable to make simple one touch passes or back post crosses 🤷🏼‍♂️ "
4069,Everton,"Agreed, I've been patient until now, he had credit in the bank after last season- however, no longer "
4070,Everton,"Listen, i hate pragmatic backwards dogshit football… but the truth is the best, most attacking options we have are on the pitch. We are keeping nothing back really, short of a beto cameo. Frankly the squad we have is functional at best. Think 80’s eastern block rather than 2000’s spain. We havent got anything else. Im not sure what tune anyone else would get out of them. Watching individual players screaming for movement suggests to me that its not a system, its a player mentality problem. They look tired and flat footed, with bodyshapes like they are all readying themselves for a sprint back towards their own goal rather than rolling a shoulder into space. Dyche cant put it in the net, he also cant beat the first man with a cross. Theres a severe lack of courage within the team and im not sure a manager change will do alot to change that "
4071,Everton,The worst manager we have had he's utterly clueless imagine not being able to beat a team with 10 men. How is this guy still in a job. Mark my words he will relegate us 
4072,Everton,The boredom is unbearable 
4073,Everton,"I've been saying this from the start of the season and it is very vindicating to see the sub finally start to acknowledge it. People who say ""he kept us up"" yes I appreciate his past achievement but are you watching the games this season? I would wager we start the New Year with 11 points, and at this pace I don't see how we earn above 40 points this season. "
4074,Everton,He flays them so their knackered come match time. Fuck dyche days 
4075,Everton,TBF we would have lost the game through a Brentford counter attack had we pushed more men forward. 
4076,Everton,Looks like Toffee TV have destabilised the club again. 
4077,Everton,"this is the first game where it hit me that dyche isnt the guy, he is holding the team back. 

If this were the NFL (which I know it isn’t) he would be an excellent defensive coordinator for us, but he just doesn’t know enough about attacking to do the job of a manager Stop trying to Americanise the sport mate."
4078,Everton,"If he goes FONSECA AND THAT'S FINAL Why would Milan’s manager who’s been in the job since the summer come here?

One who the fans aren’t particularly warm on either because of their drop off."
4079,Everton,We will have at best 13 points from 19 games so that PPG is dropping 
4080,Everton,"TFG will fuck him off I'm assuming TFG is The Friedken Group, not That Fat Guy or The Flying Guy or even The Friendly Giant"
4081,Everton,"I see you're in the denial stage I'm not denying anything, we're still in a poor PSR position. We won't be sacking the manager with 6 months left on his contract when he's got a massive payout clause, especially if we're gonna be fine relegation wise."
4082,Everton,Lad if you think Dyche is keeping us safe you must be watching the games with your eyes closed Comfortably kept us up despite two points deductions last season?
4083,Everton,"Dyche is not keeping us safe mate, have you been watching the games? Yeah and it's miserable offensively, but defensively we're fine now that Branthwaite is back"
4084,Everton,Hopefully. 
4085,Everton,"But they will come hopefully in January and then he gets the sack tho, I’d be shocked if they wait the whole season Nah, why start your ownership by sacking a manager with 6 months on his contract. They will have someone lined up behind closed doors. Dyche will be politically cock blocked and he knows it."
4086,Everton,He’s done assuming the takeover concludes. If TFG get the nod he gets the Spanish fiddler. 
4087,Everton,"We're not going to look like staying up for long. All of the current top 8 plus Man U, Wolves and Bournemouth in are next 11 games. Will be surprised if we take 6 points. "
4088,Everton,71 shots in our last 4 games and we’ve scored 1 goal. He’s not great but the players simply aren’t good enough either We’ve had about 2 somewhat reliable finishers in the last 10 years and that’s Lukaku and Richy.
4089,Everton,"That's what those Dyche outers don't get. Who would get these players to become scoring machines? The only way to attempt to score is by shooting a lot. Eventually it will result in a goal. Honestly, idk what people expect. He's been completely finacially strapped in the transfer windows, he's been forced to sell his best players, and he's still managed to improve the team. I appreciate the improvement is minor, but ffs, the guy needs to be cut a bit of slack. Ancelotti did it. He can’t be the only manager out there that could get goals out of DCL And that’s the point people are missing. He’s keeping the defense tight because he knows he doesn’t have finishers… Won 7 games in 11 months, eventually it will result in a goal... if by now you can't see that eventually is not reasonable you're delusional sorry. The players have more to give, the manager is fucking shite Ah yes the ever tested 'nobody could get these players to perform' argument from the end of the Lampard tenure, very good sir, fine choice and an excellent year."
4090,Everton,If it's only about players then why do any teams bother with coaches at all? A different coach would flip the mentality and hopefully bring in some 21st century coaching methods. 
4091,Everton,"Comments like this are evidence that, after 4 years of crap managers, people have forgotten what a manager is meant to do. A good manager improves players. A good manager drills patterns of play in training. A good manager actually has the imagination and ambition to say, ""when we're in this situation, this is what we'll do to try to get the ball into the box and score a goal"", then actually implements a strategy aimed towards that. A good manager takes the resources he has available to him and develops a competent way of playing that gets the best out of whatever players he has. You'd have a tough time arguing that Dyche is doing any of this.

But ""what else could he have done"" at home against the 10 mighty men of Brentford is the conversations we're stuck in. 26 shits, only 6 on target.   49 crosses, only 8 were successful.  What are you even on about."
4092,Everton,"He could’ve brought Beto on for Doucoure or Lindstrom at HT. 

Instead, he moved McMessi out to the left where he’s ineffective. 

Then he brings Beto on for Lindstrom after 70 odd mins. We created some half chances but doing it for 45 mins instead of 20 mins would have increased our chance of scoring. 

Frank was trying to win the game with 10 men. Dyche was trying not to lose it with 11. The fans have been begging for Ndiye to play behind the striker, which is what he did, and now people are moaning that McNeil was moved out to the left instead. Good points"
4093,Everton,"We don’t have the offensive talent to be an offensive team. DCL appears to have had 1-1,5 great seasons and now is just not good enough to get it done. Beto is better off the bench imo. 

Dyche can’t make Gana, Doucs, Dwight, or whoever suddenly score 2 a game from the box if his strikers aren’t either. "
4094,Everton,"Lindstrom has been our worst attacker for weeks, he's absolutely clueless in the final third "
4095,Everton,The fact that our opposition keepers always seem to know exactly what our attackers are going to do and where they‘re going to shoot is getting depressing. They‘re way too predictable  
4096,Everton,"A better manager gets more quality out of the same players. Players' quality isn't a rigid inflexible quantity, else what would be the point of a manager other than team selection? 
Some people know how to get the best out of players (carlo and DCL for example), I don't think dyche knows how to get the best out of any of this lot. Also, Carlo had Digne and James getting DCL the ball.  Dyche, as much of a dinosaur as he may be has *checks notes* mykelenko and…. I don’t know, Doucoure???!!!

Look at how great Halaand has been since KdB has been out.  Guess Pep’s a bald fraud too, given that he’s lost 5 in a row, right?"
4097,Everton,"Yes but take a look at those 8 teams, and then take a look at the next 8! We’ve needed wins, and he doesn’t know how to win games Completely agree. I wasn’t defending him or the results. A point today against a team playing with 10 men, at home with the fixtures we have coming up is inexcusable. It doesn’t change the fact that we’ve survived twice with him in charge before and the people running the club want as much assurance as possible that we’ll survive again. No one else offers that as much as Dyche does in their eyes. He’s going nowhere. Funny how that’s what he supposedly said to his Burnley side about Everton when they played us… 🤣"
4098,Everton,"Man has had 0 money to spend. He’s not a miracle worker. He can’t finish the shots for the attackers. This sentiment is crazy. It doesn’t look good but I don’t know if a manager alive could do anything with this group Less than 0!

Probably really frustrating for Dyche to consistently be called a relegation specialist who can't score goals, when the biggest goalscoring threats he's had available ever are Sam Vokes and Chris Wood. Would be interesting to see how he would set up a team given any resources. I agree.

But what else can he do if his tactics gets the ball at DCL’s feet or Beto’s head and they do fuck all with it?"
4099,Everton,"What would your tactics have been to breakdown a team defending with ten men in the box? I’m genuinely interested. Getting the fullbacks overlapping and trying to pull crosses back, just quicken things up. Even the few times Brentford were out of shape we didn’t look to play through quickly. It’s more a general thing than just playing against 10 men."
4100,Everton,"I’ve had to read the first sentence in the third paragraph about 10 times. What? Okay, let me rephrase: Dyche wants our attacking play to be high-tempo, to expose gaps in the final third with quick decision-making and incisive passes. He also utilizes a high press at opportune times, to try to force turnovers in dangerous positions. At the same time, he values defensive organization so we don’t get caught on the break."
4101,Everton,"How many clear cut chances did Everton create today? 

Brentford created better chances with 10 men than we did with 11 today. Frank was trying to win the game. Dyche was trying not to lose it. > Brentford created better chances with 10 men than we did with 11 today.

We can be coached better undoubtedly but even someone as unassuming as Jensen walks into our starting XI because he can pass a ball with purpose. There’s literally no one in our squad with that ability. Getting in and around the box and pressing high is tactical. Players lacking ability and creativity to break lines isn't on the coach. 

What coach and or adjustment gets us breaking brenfords back line today?"
4102,Everton,"What chances are you referring to? I just came back from the game and would argue Brentford had more clear cut chances, E.g the wissa one. Just looked at the xg also and we had 1.15 and they had 1.08, with a man sent off of course. If you seriously believe we played well there your standards have been dragged through the floor.  I mean 27 shots compared to 9 says it all, we're just very wasteful"
4103,Everton,7 league wins in just over 11 months. 
4104,Everton,"We almost had 30 shots. What else does a coach need to do. If we got pep it doesn't change the fact that Dom can't finish a sandwich.

McNeil will never cap for the country and he is our biggest threat.

Yall wanna play a progressive style like we attempted with frank lampared but we have one of the least threatening attacking front in the league. Dyche looks st the bench to see 0 goal 0 assist Jack harrison as a good option.

Yall want dyche to play tiki taca with guys like myko who have 2 weak foot. How many of those shot were from decent positions after quick attacking plays and not just predictable passages of play. Really think Pep couldn’t do a better job?"
4105,Everton,[deleted] He’s the one picking the team and setting the tactics.
4106,Everton,"Not the supporters’ job to do the search and hire 🤷🏼‍♂️ However, it IS the supporters’ job to decide they’re done supporting him. Absolutely hate when people have this response. All my kopite friends hit me with the same response when I say I want dyche gone. give me some unknown second division manager the management have identified which fits the philosophy we are trying to mold the club into. That’s not our job to pick. "
4107,Everton,Probably don't feel like getting downvoted by a bunch of angry fans looking to argue 
4108,Everton,"Here. I'm the stability brigade. Everyone screams for our manager to be sacked and I've just heard the same thing since Martinez other than ancelotti.

The team is shite from top to bottom regardless of what manager we have.

Our best players have had to be sold in recent seasons because of moshri and the recruitment he approved when George Mendez had his ear flogging us the shite he couldn't get rid of anywhere else causing us to overspend and throw mad wages at players.

I wouldn't be sad to see the back of dyche but if we binned him off today we'd be screaming to sack the next manager in 2 months unless something fundamentally changes at the club.

Hoping the new owners actually pull through and do something but if not we're gonna tumble down the leagues like Sunderland did. I remember seeing some want ancelotti out when we started dropping points, I think this fanbase just blows extremely hot and cold"
4109,Everton,"We've been pathetic for 5 years, and that's being generous But at least now we are even more and have manager who insists on using a 'striker' scoring 2 goals in 1000 minutes and a 40yo RB."
4110,Everton,"Why would Everton have sacked him during the summer with an absent owner, and amassing 47 pts in a season where we had 2 pts deductions? Because he's tactically clueless, repetitive, easy to guess and a dinosaur in general."
4111,Everton,Everton have been pathetic for a long time my friend 
4112,Everton,"Let's not let him have the tough December games, because now we need the points from them because he's wasted the easy games. "
4113,Everton,"This. Nothing is going to happen until the takeover goes through. Moshiri isn't going to (or able to) stump up a bit of cash for getting rid of Dyche. Even if it won't be a huge amount due to his contract running out in the summer. He's sold us, no way he's paying anything over and above the bare minimum he has to "
4114,Everton,Stop trying to Americanise the sport mate. 
4115,Everton,"Why would Milan’s manager who’s been in the job since the summer come here?

One who the fans aren’t particularly warm on either because of their drop off. Look at his win rate % across all clubs he's managed and ac millan is ac Milan they only give a shit at finishing top four and nothing else.

Plus Fonseca has said he wants to manage in England and friedkin has worked with him before."
4116,Everton,"I'm assuming TFG is The Friedken Group, not That Fat Guy or The Flying Guy or even The Friendly Giant It’s TGI Fridays"
4117,Everton,"I'm not denying anything, we're still in a poor PSR position. We won't be sacking the manager with 6 months left on his contract when he's got a massive payout clause, especially if we're gonna be fine relegation wise. Amazing how many of our fans forget all these factors. It's not as simple as we're on a bad run, sack the manager. >especially if we're gonna be fine relegation wise.

I see you're in the denial stage. His payout clause is 6 months of his contract, so about £3m."
4118,Everton,"Comfortably kept us up despite two points deductions last season? Different season though. We have 11 points out of 12 having only played one team in the current top 6. We play Liverpool Arsenal Chelsea City in a row in december, this can get pretty bad by new year. Last season wont keep us up this season We look even worse than last season Great, I'm not exactly sure why that's relevant to this season."
4119,Everton,"Yeah and it's miserable offensively, but defensively we're fine now that Branthwaite is back Tell me that after these december games are over. 👍"
4120,Everton,"Nah, why start your ownership by sacking a manager with 6 months on his contract. They will have someone lined up behind closed doors. Dyche will be politically cock blocked and he knows it. "
4121,Everton,We’ve had about 2 somewhat reliable finishers in the last 10 years and that’s Lukaku and Richy. 
4122,Everton,"Honestly, idk what people expect. He's been completely finacially strapped in the transfer windows, he's been forced to sell his best players, and he's still managed to improve the team. I appreciate the improvement is minor, but ffs, the guy needs to be cut a bit of slack. Fully agree, he's had the hardest of hands with this job and played it well overall, we will be comfortably safe this year despite us being forced into making the largest profit in the league last few years. Give him and Kev a chance when they only need to break even and don't need to sign players on klarna, it'll get better Yeah I hate watching us play right now, but I've seen people say stuff like any other team would've sacked him by now. But at any other team he'd have had about £100m to £300m more net spend to make a team that can score a fucking goal"
4123,Everton,"Ancelotti did it. He can’t be the only manager out there that could get goals out of DCL The more I see of Calvert-Lewin the more convinced I become that the season under Ancelotti was a fluke. I’ve never considered him a premier league level striker, he wastes far too many chances. Think it’s perhaps time to give Beto a run of games, he can’t be any worse, can he!"
4124,Everton,And that’s the point people are missing. He’s keeping the defense tight because he knows he doesn’t have finishers… 
4125,Everton,"Won 7 games in 11 months, eventually it will result in a goal... if by now you can't see that eventually is not reasonable you're delusional sorry. The players have more to give, the manager is fucking shite "
4126,Everton,"Ah yes the ever tested 'nobody could get these players to perform' argument from the end of the Lampard tenure, very good sir, fine choice and an excellent year. He's outperformed the last two guys, with worse squads. I'm not saying he's good, but still... I mean… Dyche would have had us finish what 13th last season without points deductions, and that was with a top 3 or 4 defense. He brought in Ndiaye and Lindstrom this season to improve the attack. Chermiti and broja have been injured. Mangala has looked good but needs to get on the pitch and integrated a bit more. Who would you rather have managing us? I’d love to hear what option you’d take over Dyche for the rest of the season"
4127,Everton,"26 shits, only 6 on target.   49 crosses, only 8 were successful.  What are you even on about. ...what are you even on about? Was that a response to any specific point? Because those stats moreso prove my point. We're not creating high-quality chances that lead to goals. It's just hoofball and inshallah, as it has been in every other game, it's just this time we had more of the ball because we were playing against 10 men for half of the game. There still weren't many competent attacking moves. And again, one of the first things I listed that a good manager does is improve players. A good manager knows his squad well, leans into their strengths, and improves their weaknesses by seeing them every day in training and...ya know, actually coaching them.

I'm sorry, but if you don't think anything else could have been done against 10 men--not a formation change, earlier subs, a tactical change to move the ball quicker and stretch them--nothing, and that Dyche is doing everything you'd want as a manager because we missed some poor chances, then I don't think continuing this convo will be beneficial to either of us. I think we live in different realities."
4128,Everton,"The fans have been begging for Ndiye to play behind the striker, which is what he did, and now people are moaning that McNeil was moved out to the left instead. McNeill is ineffective on the left. Mainly because he lacks pace and trickery to do anything from out there. If he had an overlapping full back to support him he might do more out there but Mykolenko is more comfortable sitting back. McNeill impacts the game more from the 10 role where he can play through balls and shoot. 

Even if Ndiaye prefers playing 10 he can affect the game on the left. He commits players and makes defenders life more difficult than McNeill can do out there. Of course, we have another 10 on the books in Lindstrom. And he does look lost out wide. Signing 2 number 10s whilst having 2 already on the books might raise questions about Thelwell and recruitment. Especially when we were crying out for wide players and full backs. But that’s a story for another thread."
4129,Everton,Good points 
4130,Everton,Never related more to the term onwards and sideways I prefer ‘onwards and backwards… then a pickford punt’
4131,Everton,We are moving sideways. Unsure if that is because of Dyche’s tactics or a lack of investment in the squad. Watching the game I felt if we’d had Coleman and Baines in their prime on the pitch today charging forward on the overlap putting in great crosses we could well have opened them up and won. Team is a bit hamstrung. 
4132,Everton,I prefer ‘onwards and backwards… then a pickford punt’ 
4133,Everton,"Really just awful shooting and terrible chance quality. 
Only one shot out of 27 was above 0.1 xG and that was Beto's header The chance creation’s pathetic. No idea what to do in forward areas other than a deep cross which just reaches the edge of the box. I’m shocked the deflection early on isn’t above 0.1 xG considering that was an absolutely world class save. But in any case, yeah, it was dreadful  After about 10 games last season we had the highest xG in the league, it’s just we had DCL up front! Start of this season we were scoring goals, just conceding more! So WTF’s happened to our attack?! Mykolenko's was arguably the best chance too"
4134,Everton,1 big chance at home v 10 men is a fucking joke 
4135,Everton,DCL should never start another game for us 
4136,Everton,"We have no problem in creating chances and having chances. But almost every chance over the last few matches has been a pot shot. The quality of chances is abysmal. 

The opposite was true last season when we weren't doing well, we had great chances and were genuinely unlucky to lose those games "
4137,Everton," We Couldn't score in a brothel Oh we could, it would just end up being a mop and bucked in a dark cupboard"
4138,Everton,11 shots from outside the box is really bad. What’s even worse is 1 big chance from 16 shots inside the box. Really shows the lack of composure or actual knowledge of how to improve your chances of scoring in the box. 
4139,Everton,The beautiful game…. Not for us fans currently. We got home after watching another nil nil draw and watched some hurling at an on its feet and  sold out Croke Park last night and my youngest lad who goes with me (25) says.... Why the fuck can't we.be in a crowd like that .... And this Hurling is amazing to watch.. mad eh.
4140,Everton,"It's so hard to watch, why have we not got a goalscorer or at least chance creators. The final ball isn't good enough. "
4141,Everton,Ironic that Dyche's Burnley would coax teams into shooting low quality from out of the box 
4142,Everton,Pathetic is the only word for it. 
4143,Everton,Is the whole team taking SSRIs? Not a single one can finish 
4144,Everton,"Would McNeil, Lindstrom, DCL, Harrison, or Beto start for any other premier League sides besides potentially the current bottom 3 ? Take off your blue tinted glasses before answering DCL btw, dude would've been good possibly in the 80's and 90's but in modern football he is beyond substandard quality for a striker. Can't shoot , can't take players on 1 vs 1. 

My point being, our offensive quality up top is shocking and that's the understatement of year. The friedkin group cannot come in soon enough. "
4145,Everton,What was the big chance? The one Mykolenko lashed over the bar? Beto’s header I think
4146,Everton,Dycheball at its finest today. Christ it was a terrible watch. 
4147,Everton,We must have sent 80 crosses in. Just one after the other. 
4148,Everton,"We have zero attacking identity, that's on Dyche. "
4149,Everton,The chance creation’s pathetic. No idea what to do in forward areas other than a deep cross which just reaches the edge of the box. Does that come down to how we've trained and set up?
4150,Everton,"I’m shocked the deflection early on isn’t above 0.1 xG considering that was an absolutely world class save. But in any case, yeah, it was dreadful  "
4151,Everton,"After about 10 games last season we had the highest xG in the league, it’s just we had DCL up front! Start of this season we were scoring goals, just conceding more! So WTF’s happened to our attack?! "

4155,Everton,Beto’s header I think 
4156,Everton,"Does that come down to how we've trained and set up? On top of the lack of quality That and player quality. No attacking system makes us rely on individual moments, when the individuals are crap...well this stat line happens."
4157,Everton,On top of the lack of quality What about all of the shots we had from 30+ yards out?
4158,Everton,"That and player quality. No attacking system makes us rely on individual moments, when the individuals are crap...well this stat line happens. Players are crap, not Dyche too? 

I think they’re all shit."
4159,Everton,What about all of the shots we had from 30+ yards out? 
4160,Everton,"Players are crap, not Dyche too? 

I think they’re all shit. Dyche too, that's the system bit. I think he just says ""counter and score"""
4161,Everton,"Dyche too, that's the system bit. I think he just says ""counter and score"" "
4162,Everton,"For those newer and younger supporters, the Mike Walker days were the absolute worst. Just think the most disjointed football, a team of individuals playing without any guidance and losing most games, all with an arrogance from the man himself that only Donald Trump could surpass. That said, he was in charge for the game I’ll never forget, the most amazing comeback and atmosphere (with only 3 stands) when we survived on the last day beating Wimbledon 3-2 after being 2 down in no time! He was in charge but I can't bring myself to give him any credit, the bastard. Reality is nothing if not ironic, lol First part could describe Dyche lol"
4163,Everton,Carlo Sean Dychelotti Seano Ancelotyche Should be Winnotalotti
4164,Everton,Mike “Dead Man” Walker. 
4165,Everton,"Personally, I want to see Dyche give Broja a proper spin before I kick him to the proverbial curb. We’ll see… lol I mean Broja can't be as bad as Brett Angell, surely!"
4166,Everton,He's bad but not that bad. 
4167,Everton,"He was in charge but I can't bring myself to give him any credit, the bastard. "
4168,Everton,"Reality is nothing if not ironic, lol "
4169,Everton,First part could describe Dyche lol 
4170,Everton,Seano Ancelotyche 
4171,Everton,Should be Winnotalotti Winnanotalotti?
4172,Everton,"I mean Broja can't be as bad as Brett Angell, surely! I never saw Angell play, but from what I’ve heard, you’re absolutely right, lol"
4173,Everton,Winnanotalotti? 
4174,Everton,"I never saw Angell play, but from what I’ve heard, you’re absolutely right, lol "
4175,Everton,"I'd love some shots on target I’d love some shots Some actual finishing would be nice. 71 shots in our last 4 games, and we’ve scored 1 goal."
4176,Everton,I'd like to see him impact the back of the net mainly 
4177,Everton,"Nothing much, Broja is not a back to goal striker so unless we change our approach then people will be bitterly disappointed with his impact So, that’s another dose of bitter disappointment to look forward to then."
4178,Everton,Him and Chemitri are both needed to help us score goals. DCL plays well but isn’t scoring and Beto is only getting short amount of time to do anything. DCL is leaving in January. It's a mess that we've to rely on him
4179,Everton,"If we do get a new manager and play 4-3-3 or 3-4-3 could he be one of the wide forwards.

DCL is stinking the place out at the moment but some support would help him. "
4180,Everton,"Hope I'm wrong but I don't think he's good enough to be our solution. We've never had DCL be consistently fit, also the 10 and wing roles have had little consistency in addition to Dyche having to scrap the offensive work early on due to our horrific defensive start to the season. I think DCL's output is hurt by this more than anyone else, surely it will improve soon since if you can pin teams in their 3rd that usually means the next step is some sequences of play.

These sequences are definitely not present, late on Beto carried the ball to the right wing and DCL ran TO THE SAME WING. An empty box with both our strikers in the corner, also Lindstrom is not helping matters whatsoever. 

I think we can judge our strikers after we find our starting 11 given the circumstances of the last few seasons transfer dearth combined with this seasons surprise meltdown of our defense without Branthwaite. "
4181,Everton,"We're creating chances, just lacking composure in the final pass and shot. Last year, we hardly created chances.

Now need Broja & Chermiti to provide healthy competition to DCL. "
4182,Everton,My guess is he’ll have zero impact because dyche will stick with DCL 
4183,Everton,"Tough to tell. He is a real #9 I feel like he could bang em hoke if McNeil and Ndiaye can gel with him. 

He isn't the type to take over the attack "
4184,Everton,"He needs to use his voice and demand for the ball.

The final third is where we lack this season but yet it's the same story game after game after game.

BROJA HELP! "
4185,Everton,I’d love some shots Something like 70 shots over the last 4 games? One goal? I had some shots last night. It doesn't help.
4186,Everton,"Some actual finishing would be nice. 71 shots in our last 4 games, and we’ve scored 1 goal. Did you watch the game? A shot is us smacking the ball against 5 or 6 defenders. Technically a shot... But it's not because of poor finishing we're shit."
4187,Everton,"So, that’s another dose of bitter disappointment to look forward to then. Broja, like Beto, are best suited at running towards goal. If he’s going to be used as a target man he may as well go back to Chelsea

He maybe played off the right or behind Dom and told to be as close to as him as possible. But I just can’t see it.

Our way of playing is the biggest factor in all this"
4188,Everton,"DCL is leaving in January. It's a mess that we've to rely on him Who’s going to pay for him in Jan when he’s almost out of contract? I’ll keep my fingers crossed. He’s definitely got talent and technique, but it’s not happening for him at all this season. He probably not 100% focused as he wanted Newcastle"
4189,Everton,Something like 70 shots over the last 4 games? One goal? 
4190,Everton,I had some shots last night. It doesn't help. 
4191,Everton,Did you watch the game? A shot is us smacking the ball against 5 or 6 defenders. Technically a shot... But it's not because of poor finishing we're shit. 
4192,Everton,"Broja, like Beto, are best suited at running towards goal. If he’s going to be used as a target man he may as well go back to Chelsea

Our way of playing is the biggest factor in all this Yep, we play dog shit football from the 1970s. Except we don’t even play hoof and run very well."
4193,Everton,Who’s going to pay for him in Jan when he’s almost out of contract? 
4194,Everton,"I’ll keep my fingers crossed. He’s definitely got talent and technique, but it’s not happening for him at all this season. He probably not 100% focused as he wanted Newcastle "
4195,Everton,"Yep, we play dog shit football from the 1970s. Except we don’t even play hoof and run very well. "
4196,Everton,Grew up in GR but don’t live there any more. UTFT UTFT GR forever
4197,Everton,UTFT GR forever 
4198,Fulham,"Like sess another example of a young talent poached as a 'wonderkid' but were just clearly a decent player for their age. Yes they had a good season before leaving but lots of players who aren't considered top class have a good season sometimes.

Would they have developed differently as first team Fulham players rather than playing as impact subs for 'bigger' clubs? Possibly but almost impossible to predict how decent young prospects will progress. I think in his case specifically it would have gone well for him. Look at what Silva did for Ream - Looked so incredibly out of place in the prem in that 20-21 season then one of our most solid players when we came back up. Fab could’ve excelled if he stayed imo sess was not just a good player for his age, he was one of the highest rated talents of his generation. he was performing better than foden and sancho from 16-18 and was doing well in the premiership despite how dysfunctional we were as a team, and he looked good whenever fit for hoffenheim. injuries really killed his career and its nothing like carvalho."
4199,Fulham,"Part of me has wished to him to fail since leaving us and proves he made a stupid decision.  Lesson for other youngsters.   Also think he looked so weak against us, bullied off the ball, didn't seem up to it (thanks to Leno for that save, would have thrown my TV out the window if he scored).  

Other part thinks about the ""what if"" he had of stayed with Fulham.  I have no doubt Silva would have got the best out of him. Younger players don’t learn. There’s a few now who have left Fulham and done nothing."
4200,Fulham,LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL 
4201,Fulham,Nice one papa. 
4202,Fulham,Oh no… looks like il have to watch the brentford highlights again for the 1063379th time. 
4203,Fulham,"Poor lad. He’s young, probably doesn’t know shit. Agree to a point, he's obviously had bad guidance"
4204,Fulham,Back to Hull where he belongs 
4205,Fulham,"Would have him back. He missed his chance we’ve got Smith-Rowe now this is one area where I am content to be extremely petty. missed the brentford match but was happy to hear he got a ""mixed"" reception"
4206,Fulham,I think in his case specifically it would have gone well for him. Look at what Silva did for Ream - Looked so incredibly out of place in the prem in that 20-21 season then one of our most solid players when we came back up. Fab could’ve excelled if he stayed imo

4212,Fulham,Only for like very cheap as a sub. 
4213,Fulham,I only walked from 20 minutes away but we suffered the result together. You’re proper Fulham now friend. 
4214,Fulham,Done that too. Have seen the lads lose to both Sunderland and Spurs at Craven lol 
4215,Fulham,"Flew over from the US to watch us get walloped by a bottom of the table Barnsley in the pouring rain. What a game

Woodrow turned into prime R9

Rodak turned into prime Karius I flew over too for that turd of a match! 3-0 to Barnsley … $&@*#-ing BARNSLEY!!!!"
4216,Fulham,I’m sorry. I did the same trip and was fortunate to get a win against Brighton. Always a gamble with Fulham but at least you were at the Cottage 
4217,Fulham,"Such a disappointing result. I still think some Fulham players are not playing up to their capabilities. But I fully expected them to beat Wolves.   Fulham’s talent needs to step up. Before the game, my brother and I projected the score to be flipped. Did not think the wolves stood a chance"
4218,Fulham,"Oh wait when did they add those little scoreboard screens? Clearly, recently because it wasn't there last time I went which was... last season. (The games just aren't that accessible to me lol)

Neat little addition. "
4219,Fulham,My condolences. 
4220,Fulham,Sorry to hear. Heading there in Feb for the first time. Open to any “do’s or don’t” anyone has. 
4221,Fulham,"You and me both! I think it will be weeks before I stop hearing the away supporters singing ""Wolverhampton Wanderers"" as they did the entire second half. Oh same. They kept singing it on the walk back to the tube, it was dreadful 😂"
4222,Fulham,First time I’ve sat in the Riverside though - it was great! Fantastic view of the pitch and out over London as well 
4223,Fulham,I only caught the highlights but if you can put the result aside it seemed like a pretty good game of football.  And tbh autumn is the best time to go to Craven Cottage.  I assume the weather wasn't the greatest but the light at this time of year is beautiful and the ground just works in autumn.  I know 90% of people don't care about this kind of thing but having sat there for years in the past it's something I believe! 
4224,Fulham,"Gutted for you! Especially, after our last two results. If it's any consolation, I'm still down in the dumps about Saturday's result. 

We were on such a high from the atmosphere after the  Brentford game. Even away to Palace was cracking atmosphere! "
4225,Fulham,"At least you didn't have a seat with the view partially blocked by a bar...which I unknowingly picked when I bought the ticket. If I sat up really straight, I could see...I'm 5'2"". I hope the locals weren't laughing at me. Oh that is tragic 😂 thankfully I had some Reddit help in avoiding that when purchasing tickets."
4226,Fulham,Not a Fulham fan but I thought the point was the view until I read the comments 😭 
4227,Fulham,"£3,500 for a season ticket ?
Overhyped

Woodrow turned into prime R9

Rodak turned into prime Karius "

4230,Fulham,"Before the game, my brother and I projected the score to be flipped. Did not think the wolves stood a chance Wolves are a very good team, with some even better individuals. They won’t be anywhere near the drop. Obvs expecting a better performance but hey, that’s why it’s the best league in the world."

Players have quality in some places, especially in the midfield and two proficient goal-scorers this season. However, there's nobody aside from Dawson in the centre-back role. However, we got fucked over by our Premier League schedule. Arsenal, Chelsea, Newcastle, Villa and Liverpool in the first six matchdays fucking sucked. 

However, did I think that Wolves stood a chance against Fulham? No."

4235,Fulham,I don’t think we’re clowns for expecting something better than that at home against a club that’s managed a single victory so far this season. It doesn't seem to matter who we play after the international break we always seem to put in poor performances. A very frustrating pattern.
4236,Fulham,"well look on the bright side. the 4x champion lost 4-0 at home.

we are abit better since the last 2 goals were conceded without Andersen. "
4237,Fulham,At least there aren't any more until March... 
4238,Fulham,I felt it coming but as always hoped for the best then was crushed. 
4239,Fulham,Newcastle fan here… can confirm 😂 I'm sure we can rent out the big top if we ever get scheduled together after an international break 😅
4240,Fulham,It doesn't seem to matter who we play after the international break we always seem to put in poor performances. A very frustrating pattern. 
4241,Fulham,I'm sure we can rent out the big top if we ever get scheduled together after an international break 😅 
4242,Fulham,"It was classic though. Far the better team early, oppo score out of nowhere, a little bit of luck goes against us and suddenly we’re can’t kick a football. It was a wet evening but our first touch - everywhere - was awful. No vision upfront - Wolves choked off the wide areas, and we had no plan b. What really pissed me off was Wolves wanted it more. Almost every 50/50 Wolves won, every second ball. Shocking game. Need to put it behind us asap, though run of games coming makes me nervous. When we score in the first 15-25 minutes we sit back. An early strike is like a kiss of death at this point. 

I said elsewhere I think it’s a Championship struggle hangover. Early goal, everyone relaxes, even defence gets complacent. 

Wolves have always been a tricky one for us, but as soon as Iwobi slotted it in this was predictable. 

This isn’t on the current squad or Silva, it’s pretty much baked-in at this point. 20 years of bouncing will do that. Yeah we were winning 50/50s through both the Jimenez miss (that was a tough one given the dynamics of the deflection) and the actual goal. Once they scored tho the 50/50s stopped staying at our feet and got away"
4243,Fulham,Not encouraging with our upcoming schedule. Thats for sure. 
4244,Fulham,"I do not get the Nelson love. He had zero impact at the Brentford game, and zero impact today. Dude does nothing but stop the ball, spin round 4 times, then fumble the ball for a goal kick. Traore is much more effective and dangerous. Also why the Emile change?? He's literally the most skilled player in the team. 

Mentality is also fucked. We just need to continue playing with what we are playing at 0-0. When opponents equalise or go ahead we completely lose are composure. 

Loss is on Silva. Arsenal supporter commenting to say that I've been watching these players since they were in the academy, and I agree on Nelson and I have for quite a long time now. He has the skill but doesn't have the wits, simply put. He seems alright in interviews so maybe it's just a football/ tactics thing. Emile isn't the brightest bulb in the box either but he uses it to his advantage, and tries things others might not. He's quick to react too so he makes it all work occasionally - and when he does - it's magic. Love the boy. Alex is a fair bit stronger than both of them and is maybe a bit sharper than most give him credit for. It's just that unlike his uncle JJ, he doesn't have the freak ability and can sometimes over estimate himself. He's made notable improvements since leaving though, and it's good to see him be so consistent. All three are very confidence oriented players too so they'll have peaks and valleys. 

Anyway, they're all great characters too and I love seeing them play together but I guess that doesn't mean much if they don't play well. I rate Silva so hopefully his Reece experiment is over. He (Reece) *can* be quite the impact sub, especially when his shortcomings are excused by tired defenders. 

It's been fun tuning in this season and apart from when you're up against my Arsenal  I'll keep wishing you all the best. 

Edit: spelling/ grammar. After today’s game, it’s gotta be ESR on the left, Iwobi in the middle, and Wilson on the right tho, those 3 give us our best chance to win. Let ESR and Robinson link up together and make something happen Preach it brother You had me until the Emile change, ESR looked poor today, and Wilson still has the hot hand, so the change was warranted. If there’s anything I’d change, it would be running through Tete and not Robinson, cause wtf was that shit. We looked horrid playing up through the right side, but that’s probably due to Iwobi being over there. That has to be addressed going into the next games. Robinson won’t be here come February, but we have to take advantage of him while we have him."
4245,Fulham,"Wolves league position doesn't really tell the full story though does it, had an awful opening run of fixtures, all of a sudden now playing winnable games we are unbeaten in 4 with back to back wins.. Losing 2-1 against Wolves, whatever that’s football. 4-1 tho at Craven? Ffs"
4246,Fulham,The long and short of it is that we are a team that plays up - or down - to the level of competition we’re facing. It’s fucking maddening 
4247,Fulham,burning my mouth on molten lava bovril was the highlight of that game for me 
4248,Fulham,"Neither Nelson nor ESR deserve a starting spot right now. Nelson more so than ESR. They weren't responsible for our defensive woes but with Traore and Wilson on today we would have had far more chances. Yea Nelson was really poor today ESR clearly deserves a starting spot. Today wasn’t his best. Probably agree on Nelson, been better as a sub. traore was pretty poor. took too long and didnt get his crosses away"
4249,Fulham,We just looked like a different team those first 15 minutes of the 2nd half. 
4250,Fulham,"The boys came out with such great intensity, recovered from Jimenez’s pant shitting immediately and looked to be the better side for much of the match. I loved the substitutions and fully expected them to scratch back the draw if not win outright. 

I was wrong! 

High quality from the Wolves, I suppose that helps ease the sting. "
4251,Fulham,"wolves has always been our bogey team.

we just can’t find a way past them in last few seasons "
4252,Fulham,"think berge and reed out was a big miss. love cairney but legs aren’t there, lost the midfield battle in a big way 2nd half "
4253,Fulham,"Hate to say it, why do we do so well against top of the table clubs but when we go against BOTTOM of the table (which should be a given 3 points) we torture ourselves and suffer@! It’s not true though if you add it up. More a matter of fans expectations being met or not. Generally beat lower teams at home."
4254,Fulham,The long break must have disturbed the team chemistry. Let's hope that the team would do better in the next game. This happened for Villa. I'm not too worried unless Andersen is serious.
4255,Fulham,"That was a deserved defeat after switching off once taking the lead, first touch like a trampoline, and ideas how to break them down once we sat back.

I think I agree making a bunch of changes on the hour mark - but using all 5 subs early left us dead when we then spent last 15mins down to 10 men, and yeah ESR wasn’t great but he’s by far the one most likely to open something up. 

And was pissing rain blowing into stands, freezing my bollocks off, trains a joke getting home. But that’s why we love it. "
4256,Fulham,"No no its okay. We literally never need to worry that we're mentally weak and that we drop points easy. Its fine...

*Genuinely hope the guy that told me this is having a great weekend!*

The cold hard truth is that we make rods for our own backs. We expect to be allowed to do our own thing out of sheer arrogance *and we play like it,* and are completely stunned when the other team show up. We piss around with the ball, dont run through the center, **dont attack the ball when its crossed in**, and wonder how we drop points every game.

Its not fucking good enough, and we need to start calling it out! 100%, tactically it’s not good enough to keep repeating the same thing over and over again and expecting it to bring results. It worked for 5 minutes of the Brentford game, but did not work for 90-odd minutes. We look at our best on the counter, not by crossing in balls and hoping for the best. So why not take the man on sometimes or square it to someone just outside the box to take a shot?"

4264,Fulham,Yea Nelson was really poor today 
4265,Fulham,"ESR clearly deserves a starting spot. Today wasn’t his best. Probably agree on Nelson, been better as a sub. Not saying he doesn't deserve a starting spot most games.  But he definitely isn't undroppable.  Not yet. And I really think Harry Wilson deserves a start at the 10"
4266,Fulham,traore was pretty poor. took too long and didnt get his crosses away I don't it's fair to judge him off 20 minutes today. He's been stellar this year
4267,Fulham,It’s not true though if you add it up. More a matter of fans expectations being met or not. Generally beat lower teams at home.

And I really think Harry Wilson deserves a start at the 10 Ok, that was what you wrote though and then revised (not that that overly matters). A dynamic I feel we are seeing with ESR is that he’s being held to a much higher standard than others. His return has been pretty decent - clearly one of our best. 

Reluctant to admit considering how its become a lightning rod but AP delivers very little consistently in final third and his output is next to non existent right now."
4276,Fulham,I don't it's fair to judge him off 20 minutes today. He's been stellar this year 
4277,Fulham,"Fair analysis, but the same upshot. I think it’s impostor syndrome or something. "
4278,Fulham,">This is ridiculously reactionary

Welcome to this sub "
4279,Fulham,we also only had 10 men for the last 20 minutes 
4280,Fulham,"Ok, that was what you wrote though and then revised (not that that overly matters). A dynamic I feel we are seeing with ESR is that he’s being held to a much higher standard than others. His return has been pretty decent - clearly one of our best. 

Reluctant to admit considering how its become a lightning rod but AP delivers very little consistently in final third and his output is next to non existent right now. Fair. Nelson definitely doesn't deserve a starting right now. ESR is fine if there's no other option and he's had good games. But I wouldn't call him one of our best. I think Iwobi is our best all around player right now and I think even Traore offers more attacking options. 


I think the 8 that AP has been playing in suits him. It emphasizes his work rate. And even though he hasn't demonstrated that predatory edge in the box he can still pick a pass that unlocks the defense and handles a press pretty well."

4282,Fulham,"All tickets are gone. Last I checked a few days ago, there were literally 2 tickets left. Ahh okay thank you! Only way I can get one would be if someone has one for sale then?"
4283,Fulham,"Ahh okay thank you! Only way I can get one would be if someone has one for sale then? I just checked tickets to confirm, all gone. Yes, you'll have rely on 2nd hand tickes."
4284,Fulham,"I just checked tickets to confirm, all gone. Yes, you'll have rely on 2nd hand tickes. "
4285,Fulham,All went fairly downhill from here 
4286,Fulham,It all started so well 😭 
4287,Fulham,"Must be a late injury, harsh on Berge otherwise Yeah think since he's not in the squad he's injured"
4288,Fulham,"What the fuck was that? Absolute shit show! I bloody knew we were going to undo our recent results. 

Slow out the blocks, atmosphere flat in the Hammy  End like our performance on the pitch today. Shit, that was shit."
4289,Fulham,"Lukic is in, but Berge is outta here! "
4290,Fulham,Soooo happy happy 
4291,Fulham,Yeah think since he's not in the squad he's injured 
4292,Fulham,"Absolute shit show! I bloody knew we were going to undo our recent results. 

Slow out the blocks, atmosphere flat in the Hammy  End like our performance on the pitch today. "
4293,Fulham,"Shit, that was shit. "
4294,Fulham,That needs to be in the net man. 
4295,Fulham,THANK YOU IWOBI FOR MAKING ME INSTANTLY FORGET THAT RAUL MISS!! 
4296,Fulham,"Did we just fall asleep? This was predictable: slotting one in in the first 15 minutes, then sitting back on a complacent and unprepared defence. Whenever we score early on I brace myself for a loss. It’s not unique to Fulham, not even close, but it’s been a problem since at least the Tigana days. 

I think it’s a Championship hangover that we’ve never been able to shed, thanks to a decade or two of yo-yo status."
4297,Fulham,Oh no Raul…. Can't believe it.
4298,Fulham,"Would we genuinely notice any difference if we put Sander in AP’s spot? Just feel like his crosses are always off, and he never makes me the correct pass on runs. More so I’d like to see Lukic moved up to Andreas’ spot and Berge taking the 6, as much as Andreas is an absolute grafter on set pieces we need to be more defensively sound in open play"
4299,Fulham,"The worst part of this game is the screaming kid being picked up perfectly by the mics on the Peacock stream. 

God shut up child! "
4300,Fulham,"The whole squad pressured perfectly, and what a finish "
4301,Fulham,"Can't even be mad at that goal, insane bit of play You can be mad at Anderson for letting that guy blow by"
4302,Fulham,"This is just painful, we've been stellar so far this season and this is our worst performance so far. Credit to Wolves for being switched on, and credit away from us for being poor. "
4303,Fulham,Iwobi really has been on another level the past few games. 
4304,Fulham,ALEXXXXXX 
4305,Fulham,"Been impressed with Bassey this season, he's ironed out a large number of his blunders from season past. Still got those 0 IQ moments in him but improving. "
4306,Fulham,Really hoping that jiminez miss doesn't end up being the thing i think about all week. 
4307,Fulham,"Bizarre performance. Haven’t seen us look this bad for a while. Nobody can control the ball. Nobody really looks interested. Feels a bit like a friendly Absolutely no desire on the pitch today! It's a game like this when you realise that we don't have a ball winner or a bloody striker! 

I don't get on Raúl's back like most of the supporters. Today, he was woeful and he has to put that chance away. It looked harder to miss that chance from The Hammy End!"
4308,Fulham,"We need another Striker so bad. We really do as we've been painting over the cracks since Mitro. We can't rely on purple patches from Raúl or Muniz again. 

This is why we are finding it hard to get some matches over the line. We've got no hitman in the box at all! 

I normally stick up for Raúl but he's been seriously banging average against Palace and his old club today."
4309,Fulham,"I love Fulham but this was not worth staying up to 2am for. It wasn't worth being up at 4pm on a Saturday afternoon for.

Shocking result against one of the worst performing teams in the league thus far this season.

At home!

Far too inconsistent. Hello fellow night watcher"
4310,Fulham,How does this announcer (USA on peacock) not know the ball boy rule?  They just put it in place this year right?   Shouldn’t someone whose job it is to work these games been aware of that.   Balls go on cones.  Players retrieve their own ball. So you can’t have an advantage or disadvantage based on ball boy feeding you the ball too slow or too fast. 
4311,Fulham,what a QUALITY finish!!! 
4312,Fulham,BEND IT LIKE IWOBI 
4313,Fulham,Andre had a front row seat to a proper Fulham banger 
4314,Fulham,What a finish by Iwobi 
4315,Fulham,Nelson needs to come off for traore. He’s offering nothing 
4316,Fulham,That is such a bad loss. 
4317,Fulham,Good night lads then. 
4318,Fulham,Kenny Tete was the dog who caught the car on that push forward. Looked like he couldn't decide what to do with that much space. 
4319,Fulham,Iwobi! Love to see it. 
4320,Fulham,Not gunna lie that was an absolutely fantastic pass and touch. 
4321,Fulham,"Ooh, that Bassey challenge could have gone worse. 45+4' That had me worried."
4322,Fulham,"Every so often we seem to have these games where the boys just lag heavily after the opening 20. 

Sucks to watch honestly. "
4323,Fulham,"One of those performances where you just regret watching. Beauty of a goal from Iwobi and that's it, we've just been had by Wolves. Really need to regroup with this international break fail. "
4324,Fulham,when it rains it pours 
4325,Fulham,"Just came over to say that’s awful for Anderson, not a nice way for the game to end. Hope he heals up quickly "
4326,Fulham,Cunha 10/10 performance today tbf 
4327,Fulham,Cant think of a player who had even an average performance for us. Shocking all round Lukic has hustled today but had no one helping him
4328,Fulham,I love Marco silva to deathbut he does have a stinker of a managerial performance in him every few months 
4329,Fulham,We look awful. Boys don’t fancy it 
4330,Fulham,We look bad all over the pitch 
4331,Fulham,Andreas and Nelson need to come off 
4332,Fulham,"Man, remember when crossing the ball was considered the big gap in Robinson's skill set? Not any more. "
4333,Fulham,2 straight bad starts after breaks. 
4334,Fulham,"FFS.

Proper bollocks, this is. "
4335,Fulham,Robinson has looked out of gas for half the game Off the pace and back to his old self. Not one decent ball in the box.
4336,Fulham,Muniz is not prem quality 
4337,Fulham,"Guehi in the midfield two weeks ago and now Lemina as a central defender, pretty interesting. "
4338,Fulham,"Gah, I love me some Sasa. "
4339,Fulham,"Need half time, this is very frustrating now "
4340,Fulham,Harry Wilson time? 
4341,Fulham,Need that Welsh magic 
4342,Fulham,"Let's see if Harry Wilson can keep this magical supersub run going Honestly, Marco needs to start him! We saw nothing in the Hammy End except his shot in the second half! We didn't test Wolves at all today. Poor all round."
4343,Fulham,Wtf is Tete even doing. 
4344,Fulham,"Chat, we’re cooked. "
4345,Fulham,Sloppy mess of a second half Same in the first half! Apart from Iwobi's goal. Raúl has to be putting that chance away today.
4346,Fulham,"We were 1 itch away from another Wilson magic, shame it had to end up like this.

Cunha world class finishing and another great game for Lemina, they deserve the win against a 10-men Fulham side. "
4347,Fulham,"This was predictable: slotting one in in the first 15 minutes, then sitting back on a complacent and unprepared defence. Whenever we score early on I brace myself for a loss. It’s not unique to Fulham, not even close, but it’s been a problem since at least the Tigana days.

4354,Fulham,Hello fellow night watcher 
4355,Fulham,That had me worried. 
4356,Fulham,"Lukic has hustled today but had no one helping him Nelson tried, but everyone look sloppy when they started parking the bus in 2nd half"
4357,Fulham,Off the pace and back to his old self. Not one decent ball in the box. 
4358,Fulham,"Honestly, Marco needs to start him! We saw nothing in the Hammy End except his shot in the second half! We didn't test Wolves at all today. Poor all round. "
4359,Fulham,Same in the first half! Apart from Iwobi's goal. Raúl has to be putting that chance away today. Fair point. *Sloppier mess of a second half
4360,Fulham,"Nelson tried, but everyone look sloppy when they started parking the bus in 2nd half "
4361,Fulham,"Fair point. *Sloppier mess of a second half Apart from Harry's shot, nothing came down our end. One chance the whole second half! Apart from Harry's shot, nothing came down our end. One chance the whole second half!"
4362,Fulham,"Apart from Harry's shot, nothing came down our end. One chance the whole second half! It was a hard watch"
4363,Fulham,"Apart from Harry's shot, nothing came down our end. One chance the whole second half! "
4364,Fulham,"It was a hard watch Really hard! 

The middle of the park was exposed. You could see they doubled up on Tete first half.

Watching Andersen turn and get caught out with the flight of the ball for the equaliser 🤦🏻‍♂️."
4365,Fulham,"Really hard! 

The middle of the park was exposed. You could see they doubled up on Tete first half.

Watching Andersen turn and get caught out with the flight of the ball for the equaliser 🤦🏻‍♂️. "
4366,Fulham,"It depends what stand you’re in?

If in the riverside, Putney or johnny Haynes it’s likely to be the more traditional ones,

- come on Fulham
- come on you whites
- I love you Fulham 

If in the Hammersmith you’ll get more player specific/complex ones,

- Stamford bridge is falling down
- who put the ball in the Brentford net
- chants for smith rowe, Bassey, Muniz, Tete etc

It would take me a while to write them all out with lyrics and the song they have the rhythm of. 

But if there are any favourite players for your son u could try help out with those Thanks!

Anything specific for Antonee Robinson?"
4367,Fulham,Stick the blue flag up your arse 
4368,Fulham,"“Mr Bishop, he’s one of our own” is a personal favourite Has Mr bishop ever watched a whole game?"
4369,Fulham,"Take me home . . . . Oh, never mind. "
4370,Fulham,If you’re seated in Putney or Hammersmith you’ll likely hear one of my favorites at some point. 
4371,Fulham,OI OI OI DENIS ODOI 
4372,Fulham,CYUM ON FOOL-UM! 
4373,Fulham,"don't get your hopes up, one of the things people are surprised about is how little chanting there is in English football.   Usually for a good concerted atmosphere you want to be in the away end of whatever team you're supporting, as that group of people will generally be of the singing demographic and the most devoted fans.  There's always more spontaneity as well as you don't need as many people to make a noise and they're all near each other. 

In home games it's fairly generic, the Hammersmith End will do its bit but unusual for anything particularly interesting to crop up.   Expect a lot of ""come on Fulham"".  

(this isn't a Fulham thing, it's an English football thing. I remember when MLS was new and they were all trying to recapture that English football fan vibe with their carefully penned songs... nah) "
4374,Fulham,"Thanks!

Anything specific for Antonee Robinson? Sorry, I didn’t see your comment in time. Shame you witnessed such a poor performance. 

But I hope you and your son enjoyed being at the Cottage and getting to see a Fulham goal!"
4375,Fulham,Has Mr bishop ever watched a whole game? 
4376,Fulham,"Sorry, I didn’t see your comment in time. Shame you witnessed such a poor performance. 

But I hope you and your son enjoyed being at the Cottage and getting to see a Fulham goal! "
4377,Fulham,"Feels like normally Marco gets criticized for subbing too late. Now he makes aggressive subs to chase a game and the result is his fault?

It was a bad match for sure but sometimes it just happens. If there's a legitimate criticism for Marco it should be about what the staff is doing with returns from international breaks more than anything. Exactly. He’s usually too slow. He made the right moves at the right time it just didn’t work out. They were better than us on the day, it happens"
4378,Fulham,"He made the right moves at the right time, you’re the same fan that would be crying he made the moves too late if he held onto a sub or two until the 80th minute "
4379,Fulham,"Losing to relegation zone teams now… Wolves isn't a relegation zone team though are they? If they had a normal schedule they should have been comfortably lower-mid table, and have always been attacking well.

Yes it is a bad loss. But let's not pretend it's the end of the world - it's a loss we will bounce back from, just like all the ones before. As a club we've had way worse than this Ur a clown if you think wolves are a bad team, they’ve scored more goals than us now Geez, stay away from bridges this weekend."
4380,Fulham,"Exactly. He’s usually too slow. He made the right moves at the right time it just didn’t work out. They were better than us on the day, it happens "
4381,Fulham,"Wolves isn't a relegation zone team though are they? If they had a normal schedule they should have been comfortably lower-mid table, and have always been attacking well.

4383,Fulham,"Geez, stay away from bridges this weekend. "
4384,Fulham,"You need to manually update the ticket in your wallet. Go to Pass Details (on iPhone) and turn auto updates off and on and that should work Yes, that works 100% do that. I had the same issue. This just wotked for me too. Thanks."
4385,Fulham,"Yes, that works 100% do that. I had the same issue. "
4386,Fulham,This just wotked for me too. Thanks. 
4387,Fulham,"Ivor! He knew how to grow a 'tache.

They all did back then."
4388,Fulham,"He knew how to grow a 'tache.

They all did back then. "
4389,Fulham,"Ouch, poor guy. "
4390,Fulham,Shit. 
4391,Fulham,Probably a stupid question but is Lukic back from injury as well? Yes
4392,Fulham,I hope he recovers quickly. Think he’s such a tidy player. Best of luck to him! 
4393,Fulham,Bruh. Love Harri. 
4394,Fulham,Wishing him a swift recovery! I may have jinxed him because I was just saying last week that this is the healthiest I recall us being in ages. 
4395,Fulham,They were all out today! 
4396,Fulham,When knee surgery is in 5-6 weeks 😞 When knee surgery is tmrw 😏 
4397,Fulham,Yes 
4398,Fulham,"I would expect Southampton and Bournemouth to fall into the same fixture category, and if so you can get 6 tickets per member.

Otherwise I personally expect the game to reach general sale anyway. "
4399,Fulham,You should ask this in the stickied ticket thread - you’ll get a better response there. 
4400,Fulham,"Interesting video, there's a lot of Fulham fans who have moved out towards Kent too. Not just down the A3 or South Coast.

Ashford's ground looks nice Yes I believe a lot of Fulham fans at the game were actually from Ashford too!"
4401,Fulham,Yes I believe a lot of Fulham fans at the game were actually from Ashford too! 
4402,Fulham,The black crest with the red outline and crossed swords is my personal favorite. That's the original from 1898.
4403,Fulham,"#7 blue and white. Ultimate FFC crest for me. GOAT Totally agree - it really calls to me and I was really resentful when we lost the licence to the Fulham (borough) branding and had to change away from the Fulham coat of arms. I have come to accept, and even like, our new badge, but the blue one is my favourite. Either way, top seven, playing like a well oiled clock. European tour? The current one is still the best imo. Just needs a little love here and there to make it more interesting."
4404,Fulham,"The middle bottom row, cracked house looks like it was made in Microsoft publisher or paint. Amazing. That's the crest from 1931. I love the crackhouse crest I know, utterly mental 😅"
4405,Fulham,"It’s really time for a change. I’d like a sleeker version of the 70’s FFC on our shirts. Maybe something more elaborate as our main crest, with a nod to the Thames and the Cottage’s architecture. I love the current logo. It’s minimal, unique and memorable. I’ve heard people say that? Why do you think that? I like our badge"
4406,Fulham,"They won't use the coat of arms again as they don't own the full rights to it (London Met borough of Fulham) it's owned by the current Borough (Hammersmith and Fulham) 

I think a revamped version of the cross swords FFC would be a good option The club produces so much merch with those badges on though 

People say this a lot but I haven't seen any proof - always wonder if it was something put out by the club at the time to justify changing the badge to the current one"
4407,Fulham,"The black red with swords ⚔️ is nice.
The blue white strip also nice. "
4408,Fulham,"Dear me, what is that cracked looking house?! Erm, that's the Cottage. Looks like some kind of cottage? Not sure though"
4409,Fulham,The current one is still the best imo. Just needs a little love here and there to make it more interesting. 
4410,Fulham,"Most of these should be hidden away, never to be spoken of again. Hard disagree."
4411,Fulham,Top left or right for me 
4412,Fulham,The bottom right one is the best for me. I like the current one and lord knows I would throw all the money at them if they changed it to the bottom right. 
4413,Fulham,So much history over here 
4414,Fulham,"If you label them 1 - 10 (1-5 top row left to right and 6-10 bottom of row left to right) I have a soft spot for 3 and 7. 
I would quite like a refresh as slough our club crest is very recognisable, it would be great to see some more of the Thames and the Cottage represented in the badge. Not like number 8 though - what was that designer thinking! "
4415,Fulham,That's the original from 1898. Best one imo.
4416,Fulham,"Totally agree - it really calls to me and I was really resentful when we lost the licence to the Fulham (borough) branding and had to change away from the Fulham coat of arms. I have come to accept, and even like, our new badge, but the blue one is my favourite. Either way, top seven, playing like a well oiled clock. European tour? "
4417,Fulham,The current one is still the best imo. Just needs a little love here and there to make it more interesting. Swastika on the toilet
4418,Fulham,That's the crest from 1931. I have a white reproduction shirt with that on (in green)
4419,Fulham,I love the crackhouse crest 
4420,Fulham,"I know, utterly mental 😅 "
4421,Fulham,"I love the current logo. It’s minimal, unique and memorable. "
4422,Fulham,"I’ve heard people say that? Why do you think that? I like our badge It’s not a bad badge, from a design perspective probably my favorite behind the black swords crest, but it’s a bit sterile, a bit soulless. I think you can inject some elements from the club’s character, history, stadium, etc into a clean, modern badge. Really passionate about this subject. First of all there’s no ‘right’ opinion. But in my opinion the current one doesn’t represent the history and character of us being London’s original club, or the many idiosyncrasies we have."
4423,Fulham,"The club produces so much merch with those badges on though 

People say this a lot but I haven't seen any proof - always wonder if it was something put out by the club at the time to justify changing the badge to the current one "
4424,Fulham,"Erm, that's the Cottage. The disrespect!"
4425,Fulham,Looks like some kind of cottage? Not sure though Definitely ain't Chicken Cottage.
4426,Fulham,Hard disagree. 
4427,Fulham,Best one imo. 
4428,Fulham,Swastika on the toilet

Fully agree with the poster who called it a swastika on the toilet. Needs a change desperately, and I hope a ship is involved somewhere."
4432,Fulham,The disrespect! 🤦🏻‍♂️
4433,Fulham,Definitely ain't Chicken Cottage. 
4434,Fulham,"💯 Fulham will always be my club, but the current badge is as boring as they come. Fully agree with the poster who called it a swastika on the toilet. Needs a change desperately, and I hope a ship is involved somewhere. "
4435,Fulham,🤦🏻‍♂️ 
4436,Fulham,There's a great Fulham community on BlueSky and Twitter. Lots of tactical discussion and general team chat. Have a listen to the Fulhamish podcast too. That will set you off in the right direction. The Fulham migration to Bluesky has been fun. It's like meeting old friends all over again.
4437,Fulham,get posting and starts the discussions 
4438,Fulham,"FriendsofFulham is the best by a mile. 

It’s modded a bit aggressively and has too many vocal gammons for my liking, but there are some decent posters there and sensible discussions too… There did seem to be some ""moments"" with some of the crew behind the site and their wider circle (who could forget one of them challenging one of our better known Swedish fans to a fist fight on facebook for... I want to say criticising the England national team)?  This was a long time ago.  I personally got banned, I can't remember why, I think I was saying that there's a place for data in football, which would've been sacrilege 15 years ago. TIFF was always great but has been completely taken over by trolls and morons now"
4439,Fulham,"Honestly this sub would be better with mods. I also hate the ticket discussions. Only way to overcome it is start a new thread yourself! 

Fulhamish has a telegram group too What would you like? I ask that seriously. I delete dozens of ticket-related threads daily. The ones that I allow are more questions related to tickets, as opposed to selling tickets. Mods do a pretty good job. Not much trolling here and the ones that do seem to be removed quickly."
4440,Fulham,Bluesky and just follow Fulham accounts 
4441,Fulham,"There's a discord server, around here ->> "
4442,Fulham,"Fully agree with you, the amount of ticket posts here are stupidly high and putting me off coming to the sub to be honest. I wish we had an automod that closed the threads down  and let people know they have to use the ticket thread.

If you’re looking for some good analysis and conversation, The Cottage Tactico on X has absolutely fantastic content about the way Marco sets up the team. Yeah we need some sort of auto mod, totally agree. Been not wanting to come back here for discussions because it is all ticket posts."
4443,Fulham,"What are good Bluesky accounts to follow?, I've heard about that app but haven't gotten round to actually downloading it yet. "
4444,Fulham,The Fulham migration to Bluesky has been fun. It's like meeting old friends all over again. I'm still only on Twitter - is there much on Blue Sky that isn't on Twitter?
4445,Fulham,"There did seem to be some ""moments"" with some of the crew behind the site and their wider circle (who could forget one of them challenging one of our better known Swedish fans to a fist fight on facebook for...

They still hate data too: never mention xG on there…

It’s a good site generally, but I think there’s a bunch of long-time posters (inc mods) who are over 60 and read too much daily mail.

The latest one was banning a bunch of threads discussing Al Fayed under the guise of ‘false accusations’ and ‘innocent until proven guilty’ etc…

Anyway, if you can ignore that lot there’s some decent stuff there."
4446,Fulham,TIFF was always great but has been completely taken over by trolls and morons now 
4447,Fulham,"What would you like? I ask that seriously. I delete dozens of ticket-related threads daily. The ones that I allow are more questions related to tickets, as opposed to selling tickets. I think you need more help, genuinely! 

Perhaps an automod might help, or a revamp of the pinned message. Tons of the threads are usually the same thing: when are they on sale, do I need to be a member etc. 

I’m happy to help you where I can, sure others will too"
4448,Fulham,Mods do a pretty good job. Not much trolling here and the ones that do seem to be removed quickly. Ya I agree with that aspect for sure. The same thread over and over is jarring though Agree - mods have a thankless job and respond quickly. Would be keen to see if there was an automod option to be explored to stop the ticket questions.
4449,Fulham,"Yeah we need some sort of auto mod, totally agree. Been not wanting to come back here for discussions because it is all ticket posts. "
4450,Fulham,"I'm still only on Twitter - is there much on Blue Sky that isn't on Twitter? Some old faces that stopped being as active on Twitter, but otherwise not really. Twitter has just become very toxic the past few years, so Bluesky is nice in that regard."

4458,Fulham,When did we score against Forest? First half? 51st. So we contributed to ~40% of that time. Crazy
4459,Fulham,I miss the forest that would turn wins into losses 
4460,Fulham,51st. So we contributed to ~40% of that time. Crazy 
4461,Fulham,There are about eighty tickets left in Block 114. Thank you. Hopefully 2 still there on Friday.
4462,Fulham,Exact same boat. New this year so didn’t have the points to get them. Loathed to pay through the nose to sit in the home end and have to keep it zipped. 
4463,Fulham,Thank you. Hopefully 2 still there on Friday. Fingers crossed. There are a lot next to each other if you're after a pair.
4464,Fulham,Fingers crossed. There are a lot next to each other if you're after a pair. 
4465,Fulham,Ridiculous. 
4466,Fulham,The fact that the price changes based on opponent is ridiculous to me 
4467,Fulham,"The prices are ridiculous. Football has a big, big problem being ignored which is the amount of money players are paid and transferred for. And sadly the cost is being passed all the way down like a lot of things in life. Disgraceful. "
4468,Fulham,Outrageous and members can no longer buy 2 tickets 
4469,Fulham,"Best to wait for it to sell out, which it probably will and try your luck on ticket exchange. Don’t know the prices but I reckon you can get a hammy end ticket for £80 "
4470,Fulham,"Khan doesn’t need the pocket change (compared to his wealth of well over 10 billion quid) that obscene ticket prices give him.

There’s no reason any premier league non-hospitality ticket should ever be over 80 quid. "
4471,Fulham,"Compare that to Liverpool away ticket, only £30 for adult and £9 for U18. Absolutely a joke. "
4472,Fulham,"You should be able to buy multiple tickets to the less popular teams. 1 ticket rule only applies to the ‘big’ clubs Man City, Arsenal, Chelsea etc Thanks for this"
4473,Fulham,"Southampton match in the Fulham end this won't happen, if you were an away sure at Craven Cottage sure. Great news. Thanks!"
4474,Fulham,Thanks for this 
4475,Fulham,Great news. Thanks! 
4476,Fulham,Just got through to the office (roughly 25 mins wait) - there are still tickets available! 
4477,Fulham,Getting the same. Now site isn’t working at all. 
4478,Fulham,Same here. Sometimes getting Ticketmaster errors too 
4479,Fulham,"I had this. Was trying to purchase two tickets (well my dad was) for my partner and brother in law in Riverside. It wouldn’t allow him to buy adult tickets, only 65+ whxih his season ticket is (which we obviously didn’t do). Don’t know if it’s a bug or just Fulham being weird. "
4480,Fulham,"I was on at 10.02 today. Single seats only available in Hammersmith, Stevenage Road and Putney stands, £70 each for an Adult. Riverside stand started at £160 per Adult seat with lots available. "

4494,Liverpool,"Dude got paid 11.5m a year... Literally made them a relegation team. I bet Everton fans will love he said this.. Was crazy that while Klopp was winning the PL, CL and World Club Cup he wasn't even the highest paid manager in the city of Liverpool >  Literally made them a relegation team

I mean Ancelotti has one of the best records of any Everton manager since Moyes, I don't think its him who made them a relegation team It was Rafa and Lampard who turned them into a relegation team. Ancelotti is arguably their best manager since Moyes."

Ok Carlo...*((wink))* "
4501,Liverpool,Someone has to respond remeber 2005 to this lol 
4502,Liverpool,Yeah your team has been playing like them this season 
4503,Liverpool,"Every once in awhile I remember that he was there, and it still makes absolutely no sense. "
4504,Liverpool,"I mean, if that means Real Madrid will be playing like them I'm broadly in favour. "
4505,Liverpool,"God I want to humble them so bad

Jude comments too

Please spank them "
4506,Liverpool,"Well, seems like Slot and dem boys are gonna have to, and i don't say this lightly, do em. "
4507,Liverpool,LUNCHALOTTI 
4508,Liverpool,"Hahahaha he couldn't get out of there quick enough, he was only there in the first place because even he himself thought he was finished Yeh kinda felt like he’d given up on his career when he went there and then realised “wait I’m not this shit yet”"
4509,Liverpool,Why would you do that to yourself 
4510,Liverpool,He still have PTSD from Istanbul. 
4511,Liverpool,"Wouldn’t brag about that if I were you, Carlo lol "
4512,Liverpool,Stop 🎣 Carlo 
4513,Liverpool,We must break him.  
4514,Liverpool,And you'll lose like an Evertonian (please please) 
4515,Liverpool,"That’s why he ditched them as soon as he could. 

Didn’t he say he was committed to Everton not long before he fucked off lol "
4516,Liverpool,Mate you weren't an Evertonian less than an hour after you said goodbye to them.

I mean Ancelotti has one of the best records of any Everton manager since Moyes, I don't think its him who made them a relegation team Agreed. Ancelotti is a top manager I said he made them a relegation club by runaway job he did.. I mean he always had some awful signings. Ben Godfrey and Allan cost 50m with no return. Then we know James was probably on about 300k a week. FFP came into this and then Rafa was given 1m to fix it all."

When Klopp announced he was leaving I thought we may be able to find someone that may be able to replicate his success on the pitch.  I never would have thought they could find someone who could do that and match the quality of Klopp’s comments with the press.  Arne is an absolute gem!

If Mo, Virgil and Trent don’t get contract offers soon I’ll be back to complaining again.  For now, I couldn’t be more impressed with their choice of managers."
4530,Liverpool,"Slot looks like he pauses time, dives into a deep think and research and meticulously crafts the perfect response before delivering it. It's like he's playing a choice-based video game with checkpoint saving. Slot uses [CHARM] for all his responses to NPC journos. Slot save-scumming before every match to get possible outcome?

Backing up mo while also not taking a jab at the club. "
4542,Liverpool,"Slot is going to have to make a decision on what kind of manager he wants to be moving forward.

If the team keeps performing this way, he's going to have enough juice to be able to come out with much stronger statements than this, if he chooses. "
4543,Liverpool,I feel like I'm learning a lot of communication lessons from Mr Slot. He gives a masterclass each time. 
4544,Liverpool,Hahahahaa fucking banger 
4545,Liverpool,My gaffer is an unbothered king. 
4546,Liverpool,Big up Arne. This man is the GOAT already. 
4547,Liverpool,Calmest guy in the room around silly media people. 
4548,Liverpool,"The highest praise I can give is that I had the Harry Potter ‘how dare you stand where he once stood’ meme ready to use this season, but I’ll never be able to use it with Arne. "
4549,Liverpool,"Check. Mate. Mo might as well just pick the pen up right now and sign da ting >Mate

Ange? Maybe he’ll do that when they send him da ting"
4550,Liverpool,"This is why I'm still on the fence on Slot, he can't keep giving away our tactics so easily "

4568,Liverpool,How in the world is Mo so underrated. The fact that AFCON and the Egypt team shunned him makes me think that Edwin Akufo is somehow involved. 
4569,Liverpool,"This quote sums up this man, effortless so so soo coool.

I'd argue being the manager of Real Madrid, Barcelona or even Man Utd is a lot harder because the managers are put under immense pressure by the fans and the expectations are sky high and you start being criticised for anything and everything and no matter what good you've done, you're only one good result away from being called for your head. The fans of our club are way more mellow in that regard we're very chill and have no problem giving time to our managers or players and even when the club doesn't mean our expectations we don't make that big of a fuss about it. When Liverpool finished 5th in 2022/23, not one person called for the sack of Jurgen but at RMA they've had a few bad weeks and their manager who's won the UCL last season, and 2 years ago(another in 2014) and also the league twice since his return, is being hounded by the fans and the management as well. And they're 2nd in the league and if they win their game in hand they'll be 1 point behind first. So no, I don't think this is the biggest job in the world and although following Jurgen's footsteps are hard, we're actually quite relaxed about it and only expected a top 4 finish before this season even started.

Bald fraud is what you have to say on Reddit whenever a football manger is bald. and when you do you will receive upvotes because it’s very funny Sorry about that. I’ll be more careful. I understand it’s a sensitive topic for some."
4603,Liverpool,"So that 0-1 loss against Forest was the best possible outcome? Damn... That was the smallest loss he could get unfortunately. It probably set off some weird butterfly effect which benefits us massively come April. Until Dawn style.

4615,Liverpool,"It's not the biggest job in football. I'd argue being the manager of Real Madrid, Barcelona or even Man Utd is a lot harder because the managers are put under immense pressure by the fans and the expectations are sky high and you start being criticised for anything and everything and no matter what good you've done, you're only one good result away from being called for your head. The fans of our club are way more mellow in that regard we're very chill and have no problem giving time to our managers or players and even when the club doesn't mean our expectations we don't make that big of a fuss about it. When Liverpool finished 5th in 2022/23, not one person called for the sack of Jurgen but at RMA they've had a few bad weeks and their manager who's won the UCL last season, and 2 years ago(another in 2014) and also the league twice since his return, is being hounded by the fans and the management as well. And they're 2nd in the league and if they win their game in hand they'll be 1 point behind first. So no, I don't think this is the biggest job in the world and although following Jurgen's footsteps are hard, we're actually quite relaxed about it and only expected a top 4 finish before this season even started. You’re omitting the fact that Anfield is Anfield (also, I don’t think anyone takes serious that it’s the only biggest job; it’s a statement that it’s top tier)"

4617,Liverpool,"As someone who is interested in words and language, at this point, ""bald fraud"" in football slang has become so widely used that it can be either an endearing term or an insult depending on the context, just like many other overused words in English with significantly varying meanings, such as ""fuck"".

4659,Liverpool,"I think Salah has every right to use any tactic to get best possible deal for himself.

Sure, there are going to be compromises from both sides if this deal is going to materialize. But we should remember one thing- the deal is between Salah and the owners. Not Salah and Liverpool. And imo, I would rather have an individual get more money out of the deal than a business entity keep more money. The club had a loss of 9M pounds last year. Its not like the money is going into john henry’s bank account, ifs getting invested in other areas of the club > the deal is between Salah and the owners  

It's explicitly between Liverpool and Salah. Does Richard Hughes represent Liverpool or FSG? Does Slot coach Liverpool or FSG FC? Are the owners paying him in any way? Which leads me on to...  

>I would rather have an individual get more money out of the deal than a business entity keep more money 

Since FSG don't take anything out of the club, but also don't inject capital, that business entity is Liverpool FC. Why not pay every player exactly what they dream of earning and bankrupt the business? You'd be the first to complain if the club isn't signing a replacement for Robbo in the next few windows."

See I have never really hated how FSG run Liverpool. They are really really efficient and systematic.

But at the same time, people tend to overlook that Liverpool FC is a business entity and works in the best interest of its stakeholders. If they were looking for our best interest we would not see decisions like the NFTs, layoffs during covid, ticket pricing hikes. 

They are not as bad as Barca printing hit pieces on Frenkie Dejong to pressure him into taking less salary than what contract they signed. But still everyone is working for their best interest here and neither are wrong.

This is a Massive story. Maybe it would, but who cares? Salah said what he did, probably to put pressure on. Carra hasnt help the situation though. Its still been blown way over the top for a bloke who's basically said he wants to say, loves the fans and has no formal offer. Like I said, I doubt the players or Slot care one bit and will be all focussed on the game."
4704,Liverpool,If carra just says this is normal negotiation tactics I really think this is far smaller story Exactly.
4705,Liverpool,Same 
4706,Liverpool,Nothing poor about putting pressure on the club when they're taking the piss 
4707,Liverpool,"Aye I'm sure you'd all prefer he said nothing like Trent, who's clearly on his way out. Van Dijk has literally done the same as Mo recently.

Salah knows how much the fans love him and he's letting them know that if he leaves, it's because he's being messed about by the club for no reason so they can leave it until the eleventh hour for leverage. It's unbecoming of the club and I'm perfectly fine with him giving the odd interview while being a consummate professional. [deleted]"
4708,Liverpool,"What does playing City and Madrid have to do with it? 12 weeks of momentum and you think that’s suddenly spoilt by contract issues, but he’s contributed to 67% of goals, and you think it *amplifies negative energy* before the two games our talisman will do everything he can to win?Then either you don’t appreciate or know much about Salah. Where did I say spoilt? It’s not binary. 

How does it not amplify negative energy? 

There was negative energy around the contracts, and now it’s blown up and most of the fan base are angry at the club.

These are huge games, why provoke distraction and take away from the positive energy around the club right now?

I don’t think it’s a huge deal and he’s got the right to speak like this but it was poor timing, you must agree with that?"
4709,Liverpool,To the point where it will affect their training and how they play in the matches? I would expect a little more fortitude from top level professionals in any field. [deleted]
4710,Liverpool,"We're the last club in the league who's going to be affected by PSR, it is completely irrelevant to us. "
4711,Liverpool,"Yeah that much money is stupidity. 

See I have never really hated how FSG run Liverpool. They are really really efficient and systematic.

But at the same time, people tend to overlook that Liverpool FC is a business entity and works in the best interest of its stakeholders. If they were looking for our best interest we would not see decisions like the NFTs, layoffs during covid, ticket pricing hikes. 

They are not as bad as Barca printing hit pieces on Frenkie Dejong to pressure him into taking less salary than what contract they signed. But still everyone is working for their best interest here and neither are wrong.

This is just how modernisation of football works. 

Hope we keep Salah, but it would be understandable if we don’t. Really they work in the best interest of the football club, PSR, and the health of the squad going forward. Doing that accomplishes what the stakeholders would be pleased with. Our wage bill is much higher than most fans seem to think with the highly incentivized contracts."
4712,Liverpool,"It is 3rd in the leauge, unless what I saw last is wrong?

It got trimmed after all the departures last year

And it is short because alot of his wages are incentive based, which means he is performing well to get payed that much.


Also image rights benfit the club too, they aren't giving him money there he is making it with them [Nope, fifth in the world, second in the league. Page 29. ](https://cdn.vev.design/private/aTCxVXgBbmVvmw45NvpIseApVuy2/251fjd-uefa-benchmarking-ecfil-report.pdf)  

>And it is short because alot of his wages are incentive based, which means he is performing well to get payed that much.  

Sure, Liverpool's contracts are incentivised. Team performance, playing in CL, individual performance and number of matches played all contribute. But that's not unique to him, it's something all the players have and something the club have to pay as compensation.   

>  Also image rights benfit the club too, they aren't giving him money there he is making it with them

If a player has a specific image rights deal it just means that the player gets money which would otherwise be kept by the club. Players usually need a high profile to be given one, enough that a club would be contacted by sponsors to use that player in a club related sponsorship. If Harvey Elliot appears in an advert on the Liverpool FC YouTube channel, Liverpool probably receive 100% of the money. If they ask for Salah, Liverpool get paid more money, but a lot of that money received gets paid out by Liverpool to a holding company.   

Of course it's beneficial for Liverpool to have players who can command such deals, but the image rights deal itself is a negative. It's just more money going to an individual player that could be spent on something else. The fact that Salah earns almost 14% of the clubs entire spend on wages is insane. I'm negotiating that every day of the week. Props to Salah and his agent, they know their worth. But as a club you've got to ensure that you're getting value on these monster contracts. Liverpool might be happy to pay him that today, but would we be if he starts picking up injuries as he ages (he had basically his first ever soft tissue injury this year) or his form drops off by even 5 or 10%?"

Salah would get those sponsor deals with or without liverpool, he is the biggest Muslim footballer, infact if he goes to madrid he would earn more

Also if you think paying for performance related bonuses the club put in is a bad thing I am not sure what to tell you, if salah is banging goals at 35 should we be mad because he is earning money?

* if I want to be really nasty, the club would lose thier share of his image rights once they lose him, how much money is that?

Liverpool have like £300m of commercial revenue, much of it not related to Mo Salah. It just means that he gets paid when he appears in any video the club produces, whereas other plays don't.   

>Salah would get those sponsor deals with or without liverpool, he is the biggest Muslim footballer, infact if he goes to madrid he would earn more  

It's not his personal sponsorship deals. The club never touches any of that.   

>Also if you think paying for performance related bonuses the club put in is a bad thing I am not sure what to tell you

Did I suggest it's a bad thing?   

>the club would lose thier share of his image rights once they lose him, how much money is that?  

The problem is you don't understand what an image rights deal is and haven't really put any effort into trying to understand. Should be clear from my previous comment. It's not extra money for the club, it's basically the player charging the club every time the club wants to use his image to market the club or sell anything related to him.   

I'm not making any comment on whether the deal is reasonable or not. Actually, if you read my previous comment I said he's probably worth that right now. The issue is that we should absolutely be negotiating this deal as hard as possible. And yes, that includes bonuses and image rights."

Football is popular and difficult.

To be at the top of professional football requires top levels of talent and professionalism generally.

Therefore, while I am sure that the Liverpool players are not robots and would like Mo to stay, I believe it is unlikely that they would allow their levels of performance, which they take great professional pride in, to drop because a teammate is having contract negotiations with the suits upstairs.

I hope for the millions they earn, they are not so fragile. Your vibes may tell you otherwise."

I hope for the millions they earn, they are not so fragile. Your vibes may tell you otherwise. To add to your point - you aren't claiming the players can't be slightly affected by the contract issues.

You're saying they're professionals - they have enough external variables at all times to deal with (wind, boots, injuries, energy levels, home life, opposition, family crisises, squad form, squad relationships) that it shouldn't be a shock to anyone's system that a squad member has contract issues.  They usually dial into simply doing their job, and control what they can control in that regard."

4742,Liverpool,He retired at the age of 60 and he spent nearly half his life in retirement. Can't imagine anyone would expect that outcome! Getting his money's worth.

4840,Liverpool,"Trent in training

Also correction: Chiesa appears to be in team training, for the warm up anyway Lock him up in the boot room for the Madrid game, don’t want him near those Francoists bastards if he can’t play I don't know why he tweeted it like that. Chiesa was training with them. Did he not join the next part of training?"
4841,Liverpool,Swear I'm watching Chiesa train with the team right now He is. Another account said he's joined up with the rest now. How are you watching training It's the warm up so well see if he stays Slot said that he trained with the squad for part of the session!

4845,Liverpool,"Honestly that's not bad news, I think it is an easy choice between an Alisson out for a couple of months and a quite in-form Kelleher. Let's give Alisson time and allow him to get himself back through smaller games "
4846,Liverpool,Don't think Chiesa is gonna make any significant appearance till January break. fine by me -- he basically did nothing all summer and id rather a relatively healthy chiesa for the 2nd half of the season I'm okay with that. Hope they take their time with him if he needs it. Worked a treat with Fabinho
4847,Liverpool,"I mean we're in a comfortable position in both leagues that we can afford to rest.... everyone for the Madrid game. Of course I wanted us to put our best foot forward vs Madrid, but it's not worth risking the season for a game that doesn't mean much for us in terms of qualification. I want to agree, but beating them tomorrow puts them in a really tough situation to even stay in the CL. They should easily win their last two CL matches, but if they lose against us and potentially against Atalanta, the best they could finish with is 12 points."
4848,Liverpool,"We need to be patient with Chiesa. If he gets a proper run in from Jan mid, or February mid, it would be fine. I'm just hoping he's fit by next December when Salah (if he's here) goes to AFCON

4857,Liverpool,"I remember when I was downvoted to oblivion for saying that Chiesa would be injured more than he would play.

Well who’s laughing now!

For real, are we cursed to never have an Italian play well for us? This is an overreaction, we're 12 games into the season lol. The team has been very forthcoming about injuries so far this season, but there is no specified injury for Chiesa, only statements from Slot that they're working on his fitness. With him having missed any pre-season training, and with Slot's penchant for managing players and keeping them healthy, I'd say it's very likely that Slot just doesn't feel a need to rush Chiesa into things and is giving him ample time to train and strengthen up, probably in a way designed specifically to help him manage and avoid aggravating his old injury.

He plays Mo's position and Mo wants to play every minute of every game and has the insane fitness to do that, so getting Chiesa on the field isn't really a pressing issue right now. Seems it would be wise to give him time to get conditioned so that he can be fully up to speed for the back half of the season when Mo (or others) will start needing some rest here and there.

Echoing this – every time Slot's gone into any detail about it, he's suggested it's trying to get him into shape after he was effectively ostracized from Juve's preseason.  We saw how strenuous Slot's preseason was in getting the rest of the squad up to speed – once Chiesa completes his boxing lessons, I'm sure he'll be raring to go. He’s not injured and hasn’t been for ages. Slot has said explicitly, several times, that he need to work on his fitness because he didn’t have a preseason with Juve and is also moving to a more physical league. He had one knock but otherwise has been on a separate regime for conditioning which has been openly talked about for months. Thanks this is the hope I needed Santiago Gimenez has missed 16 games with one major injury that made him miss 12 games (and that’s this season without Slot) and three minor injuries that made him miss 4 games

Chiesa has missed 37 games in that same period with 13 injuries after doing his cruciate and missing 45 games in 21/22. 

Chiesa is injury prone and has had a major injury. This is almost certainly his last chance at the top level so the idea that he would allow himself to be presented as injured when he isn’t is a big absurd to me."
4918,Liverpool,"They’re not overreacting at all. He’s our only signing, really talented, but everyone was worried about his fitness record. A worry which is proving very valid so far. We also didn’t pay out the ass for Chiesa, and he’s not on massive wages like some of the others may have been when they came in. If our 10M gamble works, fantastic. If it doesn’t pay off, then in the grand scheme of things, it’s really not much of a risk at the price. People should chill. Thiago, Ox and Keita were in the club several years and had a bunch of injuries during that time. Chiesa just came in the summer and has had one injury. It really isn’t the same"

Slot has said explicitly, several times, that he need to work on his fitness because he didn’t have a preseason with Juve and is also moving to a more physical league. He had one knock but otherwise has been on a separate regime for conditioning which has been openly talked about for months. "
4938,Liverpool,Thanks this is the hope I needed 
4939,Liverpool,"Santiago Gimenez has missed 16 games with one major injury that made him miss 12 games (and that’s this season without Slot) and three minor injuries that made him miss 4 games

Chiesa has missed 37 games in that same period with 13 injuries after doing his cruciate and missing 45 games in 21/22. 

Chiesa is injury prone and has had a major injury. This is almost certainly his last chance at the top level so the idea that he would allow himself to be presented as injured when he isn’t is a big absurd to me. "
4940,Liverpool,"Predicting the team that’s top of the table to win the cl, very interesting. whooda thunk eh? Also opta had us at 74% to win the prem. There's a lot of points out there still, so I'm not counting any chickens."
4941,Liverpool,"Statistically speaking, this means the odds of us NOT winning is more than 80%.

Only implies that it's way too early to make a call. The odds of us winning are roughly the odds of rolling a die and getting a 6. Which for this point in the season is very encouraging, but nothing to get too excited about.  Excellent perspective. 

If you take the percentage in isolation, we only have a 16% chance of winning, which is very low. 84% chance we won't. City has 15%. So, 1 in 6? 

It's like having to roll a 3 on a dice and getting excited about your chances of getting a 3 from the first roll while being confident about another person not being able of doing the same at the same time.

Once the chances grow and the gap to others widens beyond statistical significance, you can get excited about the probabilities. But also, it's football, so statistics and probabilities are fun until they're not. The only statistic we should be excited is when we've mathematically achieved what we wanted"
4942,Liverpool,"Favourites Wym, we're just a chill club doing our thing yk "
4943,Liverpool,"7% for Real Madrid seems way too low. Sure, they are struggling a bit right now and haven't figured out a system that properly integrates Mbappe. But they have quite a while to fix those problems, and in a knockout stage, they have a deadly team on counters. They can reliably sit back and unleash Vini and Mbappe. The R16 is also starting way later than ever, it starts on March 5 meaning that current form is useless to judge anything.

Injured players coming back, current players getting injured etc

The new format also makes it impossible for big teams to drop out of the tournament like in the past. You only need like 8 or 9 points out of 24 points to get into the 1-24 bracket. Pretty much every year Madrid won the CL recently they were given 4th/5th best odds. Madrid will get to the semis at least. "
4944,Liverpool,"Would love to know the assumptions for this super computer, seems very basic lol Only one assumption: Slot is the best football manager of all time."
4945,Liverpool,"Real Madrid at 7% and Bayern at 4% is insane Yeah there's no scenario in which a team like Inter has better odds to win this year tournament than Madrid + Bayern combined

In fact i don't think there's any team that by stand-alone has better odds than a Madrid + Bayern combination if you were to put odds on."
4946,Liverpool,"Also has arsenal at 6%, so they clearly know nothing. Hey, you're talking about a club that has won 0% of European competitions all time.  Show Arsenal some respect. [deleted]"
4947,Liverpool,Sporting higher than arsenal lmao Not after that match.
4948,Liverpool,"I hate posts like this so much. A 16% of winning, therefore an 84% chance of not winning, yet we're 'favorites'.

No mate, it's a toss up as to who's gonna win it. And the favorites are the team that have done it 6 times in the last 10 years. "
4949,Liverpool,"Barcelona are way too low here. Frankly, a lot of these rankings (us aside) are a bit out of whack. "
4950,Liverpool,I think we'll win the Champions League league but the final is another thing.  Fingers crossed we can do the Champions League double in the first year. 
4951,Liverpool,"Nice now let’s do it

4952,Liverpool,"Another way of thinking is Liverpool @ 16%, the field at 84%…

They may have the highest odds by team, but it’s far from certain.  The term “favorite” can be very misleading. "
4953,Liverpool,"76% chance of the Prem, plus 16% chance in the CL means we have a 92% chance of the double. Maffs. "
4954,Liverpool,Insane to put Real Madrid so low.  Even if there form is poor right now they have some weird incalculable power in the cl 
4955,Liverpool,more like in a group of favorites... 
4956,Liverpool,"Eh its kind of stupid, its not like the premier league, just because Liverpool are top of the league phase doesnt mean they'll do well in the knockouts. "
4957,Liverpool,"I'm not thinking in any of that percentages until we are at least 3/4 into the season but if we are honest this CL odds hardly mean anything. Playoffs are made to be unpredictable and for everyone to have a chance, in just two games things can go either way. "
4958,Liverpool,It’s only November and we haven’t even got to the next round yet! 
4959,Liverpool,"According to any seasoned football fan, Real Madrid are favourites to win the CL. "
4960,Liverpool,"I dunno. Every year I feel we are a top 6-4 team in the champions league, but it has so many variables. The season we won the league, if Alisson is in goal against Atletico we go through.... who knows how far we go.  "
4961,Liverpool,sporting being at the same percentage as real madrid tells you all you need to know 
4962,Liverpool,"quadruple run in Slots first season, here we go

  
but realistically, as soon as Real enter the knock-out stages, they're favorites to win it "
4963,Liverpool,Honestly I thought Barcelona would be higher 
4964,Liverpool,"I mean when you look at the other big teams who are usually favourites (Madrid & City) and see how they’re playing, I don’t see why we shouldn’t be "
4965,Liverpool,Real Madrid struggling & with similar odds to Sporting (without Amorim)? Yeah they're going on another late season run aren't they... 
4966,Liverpool,Football laughs in the face of these kind of stats. A team could squeak into the playoffs and still win it. 
4967,Liverpool,Real are always the favorites.  Get real. 
4968,Liverpool,Once the knockout stages start this means nothing. Liverpool has had quiet a winner's mentality this season always pushing to get back in the game and so on... But the knockouts are just one bad day from getting you out. 
4969,Liverpool,"Who wins the CL is more about match-ups, injuries, and form.

Who wins the league is way more predictable. "
4970,Liverpool,"I swear to god every single season people act like madrid has no chance of winning and they win it more than the rest of the tournament combined in recent years lmao. They’re easily favorites for this year too however bad their form is right now


Same way every single season for 5 year speople act like city wont win 20 games in a row to finish the season. "
4971,Liverpool,They need to get contracts sorted out 
4972,Liverpool,I hate these stats 
4973,Liverpool,Means bugger all 
4974,Liverpool,"Giving 7% chance to that satanic club is very woke. 

Hopefully we do go deep into the comp. Before the start, I  said I’d be happy with (minimum expectations) RO16 and Slot has worked his magic *chefs kiss* "
4975,Liverpool,anulo mufa 
4976,Liverpool,"whooda thunk eh? Also opta had us at 74% to win the prem. There's a lot of points out there still, so I'm not counting any chickens. "
4977,Liverpool,"The odds of us winning are roughly the odds of rolling a die and getting a 6. Which for this point in the season is very encouraging, but nothing to get too excited about.  Well if my luck's anything to go by that means we're rolling 6... 1's in a row. A 1 in 6 chance while there are 36 teams still alive is massive though. Obviously we’re far from winning anything but those are really favorable odds for this stage."

Upsets can always happen in football and with the current scheduling you really want to avoid playing the extra games. There will for sure be an upset or 2 as well as big teams being drawn against each other. No team no matter how big is safe"

5000,Liverpool,"A greater Manchester ref of course. I'd love to know the % of refs from greater Manchester, can't help but feel they're disproportionately selected in these games Not sure my source or memory is good buy I'm sure all those from Merseyside can't ref a Liverpool or Everton game. I think it's something ridiculous like 4 or 5 of all 20 odd current PL refs are from greater Manchester which sure is incredible.

Clearly they've got something in the water over there that makes you a better referee. Main, VAR, fourth.

https://preview.redd.it/7fkva8zp193e1.jpeg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44f779ccc543cf5bd61b0faaea6e62a0bd914b33 Don't worry, they all support Altrincham, Bury and Macclesfield.  But they’re clearly impartial, they’ve all supported tranmere their whole lives!"
5001,Liverpool,"""Chris Kavanagh is an English professional football referee from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester.""

Ashton-under-Lyne is 5 miles from the Etihad. Not that I'm making any assertions. The guy who determined the Rodri handball was not a penalty. It's not even that I think he's biased, I just don't understand why they open themselves up to these accusations. 

Surely there's one ref out there who's a good 50+ miles  away from both teams. You’re only ever a private plane ride away from Abu Dhabi anyway"
5002,Liverpool,I am sure and certain no one based in the Middle East had any input in this decision at all. 
5003,Liverpool,Really testing my creative writing skills trying to come up with a way they can fuck us harder than a kick to the chest in the penalty area and giving no pen given the mind-boggling decisions made against us already such as a legit goal disallowed due to miscommunication at Tottenham. Im genuinely flabbergasted that people mention the macca pen not given and not rodri not getting sent off(he was already on an yellow) for fully intentionally handling the ball when we tried to start a counter attack
5004,Liverpool,Fuck me. Forget any VAR calls for one.  Tierney breaking out the spirograph set!
5005,Liverpool,"Great, Kavanagh is the worst ref in the league now that the coca guy is suspended. Coote is awful, but even Coote on coke is better than Kavanagh. Legitimately the only ref I've ever seen be sent to the pitch side monitor (to review a decision he made) and not overturn it.....the game was Liverpool Vs. Everton (2021), the calvert-lewin pen when he stumbled over Trent."
5006,Liverpool, You gotta be kidding me The two referees that directly robbed us of the 21/22 title. Coincidence I am sure. Same..my first thought was it must be a troll 🤣
5007,Liverpool,"They're all from fucking Manchester! The linos are from Norwich, but all the decision makers are from Manchester. Fucking bullshit. "
5008,Liverpool,11 vs 13 it is. 
5009,Liverpool,"It’s ok lads Chris kavanagh and all his family all from 5 minutes away from city’s ground,  grew up not liking football and Paul Tierney who has been spotted in the crowd at old Trafford got confused and though he was going to a Rugby match.    Nothing to see here and stop being so paranoid these people are Professionals. Oh my god, if it wasn’t so utterly shit it would be hilarious. Wasn’t sure if you were joking with the Tierney crowd thing but no."
5010,Liverpool,David Coote as the linesman Do they genuinely have so few linesmen that they have to use their fucking corrupt refs instead
5011,Liverpool,"The dream team. 

Odds on which one of our players can get booted in the chest again with no repercussions. Taking a wild pick here but I have Ederson committing an absolute stonewall pen on an off to the races Darwin or Mo. Their back line is Swiss cheese right now and they play a high enough line that there will be space behind for attackers to run in."
5012,Liverpool,"Kavanagh (Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester)
Anthony Taylor (Wythenshawe, Manchester)
Paul Tierney (Wigan, Greater Manchester)

Good process, PGMOL.  "

5015,Liverpool,"A ref from the Manchester area reffing a Manchester team. It’s pathetic. Ref(s)

Boys are going to have to play as if they're starting the game down 2-0."
5016,Liverpool,"They'll be looking to scam back many points with this game, probably gonna see some bollocks red cards, probably completely one-sided refereeing which means injuries for our players and zero physicality allowed the other way.

I'm expecting a Spurs away level fix incoming. "
5017,Liverpool,"Refs can't stop a 5-0 win guys They absolutely can. They just need to let City be physical with us, but give every fk for every City dive."
5018,Liverpool,![gif](giphy|69vcWC5OW5srVRClR3) 
5019,Liverpool,But of course 
5020,Liverpool,Bringing out all the stops eh? 
5021,Liverpool,Fuck it we can still get the points regardless 
5022,Liverpool,Get ready for the biggest VAR shafting match. I’m not expecting anything out of this refereeing lineup. 
5023,Liverpool,are all qualified refs from Manchester or something? 
5024,Liverpool,"Paul Tierney, Kavanaugh, Anthony Taylor the all star team of screwing us over. Then you’ve got man utd Howard Webb making the schedules. When city get the crazy controversial penalty we can all come back to my comment "
5025,Liverpool,"Everyone saying we're screwed because of these refs......which refs would you feel happy about having in charge? Tony Harrington was great against Bournemouth iirc Literally any ref that ISNT from Manchester? Taylor has done few good derbies in row, in my opinion. Kavanagh, Tierney and Oliver are the worst, anyone other then them is also awful, but not on that scale. One that isn't from Manchester refereeing a game when we are playing a team from Manchester maybe? Imagine the outrage in the media if the referee was from Liverpool. At this point we can only hope for shit refs, but shit to both sides at least That ref against soton wasn't that bad I want Pawson every week. Doesn’t lose his head."
5026,Liverpool,"So we're not scoring from freekicks, we're not getting penalties, and we'll have chances pulled back prematurely for suspected offside. Stop play whenever their player goes down even if we're on the offense. Any goal we score will be scrutinized for reasons to cancel it. Contact in their box will be good enough reasons etc. In short, this is a game City will need to win or else these refs will face the UAE wrath. "
5027,Liverpool,We will still win.. Peps face will be a sight to see 😂 
5028,Liverpool,The best ref there is the 4th official? 
5029,Liverpool,This isn’t news. No matter who the refs are (unless it’s Coote in which case it’s obviously worse) it’s going to get the same reaction. Be thankful it’s not the blokes who worked in UAE If the referee was from Liverpool reffing this game do you think it would be news?
5030,Liverpool,"11 vs 13 men, need to absolutely blow them away "
5031,Liverpool,"Holy mother of fuck, Taylor AND Tierney? Taylor 4O. That's meaningless."
5032,Liverpool,"I mean at this point, who would we even want? David Coote"
5033,Liverpool,https://preview.redd.it/ul1pqziwi83e1.jpeg?width=1041&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=089554bebe5cf2d013edb2dc090be0cb1d7a59ec 
5034,Liverpool,Harry Potter and What Fucking Difference Does It Make 
5035,Liverpool,"They are taking out the Heavy artillery and cavalry all together to shaft us in this game 

Maybe they will wear their “Justice for Coote”  vests inside their jerseys as well . "
5036,Liverpool,"Oh we're absolutely fucked. 


Reminder that Kavanaugh + Tierney masterclass duo reffed the abysmal Spurs game wherein Harry Kane gets no VAR review for a blind studs up ankle breaker challenge on Robbo, that no one could understand why no monitor review was suggested post game. But Robbo got sent off with an initial yellow then VARd for red for a (bad) leg kick.


Also Jota stone wall penalty not given, because ??? He slowed down to shoot and was contacted from behind??


Powers that be do not want the league to end too early. Pep just signed his contract after all. If we get a tie, let alone a win it'll be massive enough. City will get some 90+ min pen, the one we should've got from Doku, and they'll cite it as making sure the right calls are made this time or some bullshit. 


Also. The players know this about the officials. They are not dumb. Fully expect we'll face a brash of harsh challenges, particularly on Gravenberch.  "
5037,Liverpool,Of course they'll send their best agents... 
5038,Liverpool,Bucket full of dodgy penalties incoming 
5039,Liverpool,Honestly all 3 of them are far better than having Oliver involved 
5040,Liverpool,"Bwahahahaha, couldn't write it "
5041,Liverpool,"Ok, so we have to be perfect. "
5042,Liverpool,"Genuine question. Why doesn't FIFA or UEFA make it that you can't referee in your national league? Wouldn't that cut out all this shit?

Or do they have nothing to do with it and it's a league thing? No idea how it works. "
5043,Liverpool,"This is scripted at such a cheap level, I almost expect that during the match, we will suddenly hear music drop into the walk-on music for Ramos, then the light goes out for a few seconds, it comes back on, camera pans to Salah clutching his knee, in intense pain next to a tyre-iron, and the camera panning to the exit towards the wardrobes, where we see a white Real Madrid jersey with the number 4 rushing away.

Referees wave play on. "

Now.. we are fucked. Yes but now I want to watch Snatch again 🤣"
5046,Liverpool,"So there’s no hope of this changing, right? 

Can the club lodge some sort of complaint that a guy who grew up 5 miles from Manchester City’s stadium will not be fair? "
5047,Liverpool,"Paul Tierney is a real AH, who was the reason of Liverpool losing the PL title 4 years ago "
5048,Liverpool,Well they have to do something to bridge the gap. Looks like An all Manchester centric refereeing team is the way they have gone. 
5049,Liverpool,"I mean, at this point will there be any match where we look at the refs and not think that this would be a complete shitshow? We can put any combination of refs and VAR and we'll all have the same collective reaction we have every single week "
5050,Liverpool,atleast it’s not Oliver At least
5051,Liverpool,"PGMOL: Altrincham FC something something, Whythenshawe FC something something. "
5052,Liverpool,"oh thank god Michael Oliver isnt here... but Paul Tierney aint positive news Michael Oliver is the worst. I’m not sure why, but he always tries to screw us over so no one says he favors us. Total cunt."
5053,Liverpool,Gonna have to smash em good with that shitter at VAR 
5054,Liverpool,Hahahahaha 
5055,Liverpool,The clown squad. 
5056,Liverpool,It's the final showdown lads 
5057,Liverpool,"How does the league make these decisions and think, “ right no issues here then” "
5058,Liverpool,"I'm sorry, I called Tierney as VAR yesterday "
5059,Liverpool,"We need to white wash them, nothing less. "
5060,Liverpool,Who are the linesmen? The Gallagher brothers? 
5061,Liverpool,"Good fucking process with that referee draft howard fucking webb, cunt willl be fucking us over as long hes in charge at pgmol "
5062,Liverpool,Can't wait to see how they manage to fuck up this time. Salah getting a roundhouse kick to the head only to get booked for diving maybe? 
5063,Liverpool,Interesting putting Tierney on VAR after his track record with lfc and klopp. Bold move from PGMOL considering what's come out last few weeks with Coote and his bias Where there's Kavannah there's Tierney
5064,Liverpool,Tbh they are all shit idk who would be a good pick. 
5065,Liverpool,The PGMOL are frightened that Liverpool are 8 points clear. The fix is in. 
5066,Liverpool,I'll always remember Kavanagh giving Everton a penalty after Calvert-Lewin kneed Trent in the head. 
5067,Liverpool,![gif](giphy|LpkBAUDg53FI8xLmg1|downsized) 
5068,Liverpool,So Salah is going to get assaulted all game then and we'll get nothing.

What a mess football is in. "
5079,Liverpool,I can’t believe we still even post these. Who cares who the refs are? No one’s stopping Arne’s big red machine! There's a brown envelope on its way from the UAE that disagrees with that statement
5080,Liverpool,"And Anthony Taylor, surprised they didn't squeeze in Simon Hooper and Michael Oliver to get thebfull squad in. "

5096,Liverpool,Cooked😭😭 
5097,Liverpool,"gutted for pep but maybe he truly doesnt have the managerial sauce after all It’s the same as Southampton playing out from the back—because “That’s the way we play.” Pep doesn’t have the “intensity” type of players Liverpool had and it shows. I hate to see this for him, but some coaches are better as coaches (Sammy Lee, for example). It didn't take a brain surgeon to know he would fail. A lot of people in this sub had said he wasn't up to it but where heavily downvoted for saying so. Thank god FSG did not give him a chance at the top job. I honestly don't think we could have recruited a better manager at the moment. Amorím looks like he is too stubborn to adapt, Alonso is good but may slightly have been overrated with last season's tremendous season and tuchel looks like he wouldn't get on great with the players and wasn't much of a success at Bayern. I'm just glad we aren't someone like Newcastle with wank Eddie Howe."
5098,Liverpool,"If I’m not mistaken, he has some bizarre tactics that are too idealistic for a club with the level of talent Salzburg had at the moment. He also inherited them in a downward dip, which it can be hard to stop the rot. 

Salzburg need to make some changes and quick, otherwise they’ll get blown away by Sturm Graz >he has some bizarre tactics that are too idealistic for a club with the level of talent Salzburg had

Must be gunning for the Bayern job Our tactics last season were a bit bizarre, had glaring structural issues we didn't seem interested in addressing them, we were at the point ee knew what a goal against Liverpool looked like. Christ I just saw that two weeks ago, they played mid-table BW Linz: 76% possession, 5 shots, 0 shots on target, lost 0-2. 

Reminds me of when we were knocked out of the UEL last season…

I hate to say it but if Pep can’t adapt, Salzburg needs to let him go. They’re in a difficult place but they should not be this bad."
5099,Liverpool,"Always liked Pep, but it really seems we dodged a bullet by not going down that particular line of succession.

I’ll admit I was always captivated by his pre-match press conferences whenever Klopp would hand them over. Some are just not destined to be the main man I suppose, because I have no doubt he was brilliant at what he did with us. Slot actually mentioned Lijnders as one of his biggest influences, he's clearly got something special but two disastrous spells he's also clearly got something missing as a number 1 He would talk endlessly without making a point or giving an answer. Can see why he might struggle to get a team playing his style."
5100,Liverpool,"To think there were people wanting Pep to takeover from Klopp. Sad to see his current situation, but seems like he needs to be the manager of a club with lesser expectations to start his career post-Klopp "
5101,Liverpool,"Bajetic is getting game time and is playing semi regularly. That’s the only thing that matters. Don’t care about anything else. I care about Pep doing well too tbf, would be sad to see him fail.

I think he's overly ambitious with how he wants to play given the players he has in his squad, could do with being a bit more pragmatic. But I also think it could be one of those where if you give him enough time with the players they'll eventually click into gear and start playing really really well."
5102,Liverpool,"I’ll get downvoted for saying it… No one wanted to admit pep was what was wrong with our tactics when he was here. We just had an insane squad that could make up for it. I'll say it, the past couple years we were tactically outclassed by most teams 

Just way too open, couldn't control games and gave up so many chances. We won due to the never give up attitude of the squad and their individual brilliance. I always preferred Buvač over Pep. We literally won everything with him as an assistant, he was obviously doing something wrong. Imagine if he was doing something right. 

Reddit never fails to sound stupid > I’ll get downvoted

> no one wanted to admit

Really? From my experience it felt like Pep was the main punching bag anytime anything went wrong tactics-wise or form-wise over the last few seasons."
5103,Liverpool,"Just because it doesn’t work out at a club, it doesn’t always mean you are an awful manager. Just look at Kompany. Similarly look at Gerrard, undefeated in Scotland and now laughed at pretty unanimously.

That’s not to say Pep is a great manager or anything, far from the case based on the evidence, but people are so so quick to tear people down on the internet.  Kompany promoted Burnley in his first year, so I'm not sure he's the best example for the point you're trying to make, If Pep Lijnders has ambitions to be a top manager, then he has to succeed as one sooner rather than later. It's a competitive world, and if this becomes his 2nd failure in 2 attempts, I'm not sure how many more chances he'll get. You say that but this is his second term in a lesser league and struggling again

He’s just not a good manager Forget about Ljinders and Kompany, people were down on fucking Ancelotti after his Everton stint. Insane stuff from the internet."
5104,Liverpool,"Summary for us not fluent in German would be nice. Situation in Salzburg is worrying, bad trends from last year continue. Appointed wrong people in the wrong positions. Transfers in summer were bad, Ljinders appointed a questionable captain who sucks, not enough progress and no seniority in the squad.

That‘s the gist of it. Only sixth in the league as the most valuable team, just above the relegation zone; that would be an alarm signal in any league in the world. In Austria, however, this fact weighs particularly heavily on Red Bull Salzburg - not only because of the enormous lead in squad value over leaders Sturm Graz, but also in terms of the Bulls’ long run of success. The upcoming Champions League opponents Bayer Leverkusen (Tuesday, 9pm) have been losing this dominance more and more for months. What is going wrong for the team from Mozartstadt?

Salzburg had to relinquish the league title this year - after ten triumphs since 2014. In 2023, the ÖFB Cup also went to Styria rather than the Salzach after many years. Sturm Graz, double winners and the new spectre of the dethroned serial champions, are already 14 points ahead of Salzburg - albeit with two more games to play. Even with two wins from the postponed RB games against Hartberg and Klagenfurt, the numerically top team with the eleven most valuable players in the Bundesliga would currently only be fourth behind Sturm, Rapid and Austria Vienna.

“There were already signs of a slight slump at Salzburg in the 2022/23 season,” says Dorian Schuster, Area Manager Austria at Transfermarkt. At that time, the team still won the championship under coach Matthias Jaissle without much difficulty and, despite a defeat against Sturm, hardly gave their rivals from Graz a chance; it was the only time the Bulls left the pitch as losers that season - at least in the league. In the Cup, on the other hand, they also lost out to Sturm, were eliminated in the quarter-finals and failed to win the double for the first time in four consecutive years. A first heavy blow.

Two new arrivals also caused internal unrest, says Schuster. “Bobby Clark, who had followed Lijnders to Salzburg for a transfer fee of 11.8 million euros, and Stefan Bajcetic, also on loan from Liverpool, were immediately given preference over the established players despite their lack of match practice and were in the starting eleven for the first of three defeats in the Champions League against Sparta Prague (0:3). Lijnders also opened a new barrel in goal. Regular goalkeeper Alexander Schlager was demoted during an injury break and Janis Blaswich was loaned from partner club Leipzig - and immediately promoted to captain of the team.” A fiasco, as Schuster sums up. “Blaswich proved to be too weak for Salzburg and ended up on the bench as the season progressed.” Things didn’t go any better for Salzburg in the Champions League. The defeat in Prague was followed by an even worse 4-0 defeat against Stade Brest and a 2-0 loss to Dinamo Zagreb. All three teams have a significantly lower squad value than the Bulls. “But you have to give Lijnders credit for the way they qualified for the top flight,” said Schuster. On the other hand, there was a succession of low blows in the league: a 5-0 defeat at champions Sturm, a clean sheet at penultimate-placed WSG, then at bottom-placed GAK, and most recently a defeat against each of the two Linz clubs.

Yea fair shout…while in attack we were really good, the defensive issues were inexcusable. Just basic school boy errors. Nothing virg could do when we were playing suicide ball all the time. 

The sad part to me is if we don’t have injuries/absences from Trent, Mo, Endo, szbo and Jota last season, plus if Lucho parents weren’t kidnapped, I think we absolutely win the league. There was a bit of plot armor around us for a long while until THAT United game which broke us. Not because of the style of play mind you, but the sheer quality of players we had plus jurgens ability to eke out every last drop of work rate from the lads. 

Nice to see slot go the other way and rely more on pragmatic approaches. I still think we can play much better than we have, not bc we’ve played poorly, but because I genuinely think the squad is still fully grasping slots tactics From my view, our tactics the last few seasons were bizarre, and I'm of the opinion these tactics were all Pep. 

- Uber high line only worked because he have the best 1v1 keeper of the last few decades.
- High tight right-hand triangle, which left a blank space in the middle for the oppo to play through on the counter. Relied on Thiago and Fab (who had lost his legs) to cover the entire midfield. 
- Trent show. Over reliance on Trent to create.  Moving him all over to find space without any thought to transition structure. 
- Long ball over build up. It felt like we were over reliant on the over the top ball. Essentially, gaining their final 3rd by playing high-risk/high reward ball over top from deep and hoping to nick it back in the final 3rd. 

Honestly, we almost achieved some amazing things in spite of his tactics. He may prove me wrong, but I was never in on the Pep hype. Just last year? Our world class players have made up for our tactics for years now."

what did he say? The bit that stood out to me was his response to criticism that liverpool was too open at the back.
And his response was along the lines of he doesn't care what people think because he was the one that won Premier League & the Champions League. And as you can see our defense this year is miles better not just than last year, but than anyone in the league.
And as you can also clearly see, he can barely finish in the top 4 in the Austrian league despite managing the strongest club. And that's because, in reality, he did not win Liverpool the premier league and the champions league. He was an assistant to one of the best managers in the world in charge of some of the world's best players at the time. He gave himself way too much credit and dismissed valid criticism rather than try to learn from it. And that's why he is in the position he is in imo
Hopefully this will allow him to take a step back and work on himself."

Imma chime in here even though you were not directly responding to me. 

Klopp holds his share of the bag, too. He handed the tactics over to Pep so he could ""manage"" the club after the Front Office exodus. Klopp didn't want to change the tactics. He trusted Pep, which is evidenced by Pep's appointment at a Red Bull club. A Red Bull project Klopp clearly was in discussions with and had influence over, if only in a consulting role at the time. Klopp is overall responsible for the 3 contract situations we find ourselves in because he held the power, if not title, of Director of Football for the last 3 or so years. Klopp is responsible for all of it, including Pep. 

None of the above negates the success we had, but it does outline the context with which it partially happened. Us Liverpool supporters will probably never see a side win 90 points 3 times in 5 years again. It was an amazing team, but not a team that didn't have its faults in decision making from the owners to Klopp to supporters. Last year? Allison is the only reason peps tactics worked the last four years. The high line was ridiculous as was the constant long ball for periods and so much pointless running. 

Like I said, very few will be willing to admit it. We succeeded because of the squad, not Peps tactics.  

Not too mention it’s no secret that one of Klopps biggest issues was his loyalty. Mate it was all a mad fever dream.

It defies the laws of physics for that ball to bounce off the bar for Origi to score.

Never happened.

Third highest points total of all time and still fail to win the title? You what? 25 points clear at the top of the table? Never happened

We succeeded because we had the squad to play those tactics, it's not one or the other.  If we didn't have Ali, we wouldn't have played with those tactics.  

Either way - with Klopp and Pep we could have won 3 or 4 PL titles, if it weren't for fucking City doing their financial doping shit.  Before Pep we weren't anywhere near the title when it was Buvac and Klopp.

I'm not trying to say that I think we are missing Pep, far from it, we obviously needed a change, but your insistence on shitting on him is just fucking weird. >Last year? Allison is the only reason peps tactics worked the last four years.

Either way - with Klopp and Pep we could have won 3 or 4 PL titles, if it weren't for fucking City doing their financial doping shit.  Before Pep we weren't anywhere near the title when it was Buvac and Klopp.

I'm not trying to say that I think we are missing Pep, far from it, we obviously needed a change, but your insistence on shitting on him is just fucking weird. "
5152,Liverpool,">Last year? Allison is the only reason peps tactics worked the last four years.

Yes you might be right, Thank Jeebus for Allison.....

...just one thing though there was this Irish lad, he played 10 league games last year and Liverpool didnt lose a single match either.

Like I said, thank the Lord for Allison but you my friend are full of shite. "
5153,Liverpool,"Finally looks good under a new manager and is actually our in form left back. He looked good under Klopp, Why's it taken Robertson being in the worst form of his career to say he's been good?"
5154,Liverpool,Time for left back joe gomez. Been saving him all season Gomez tried to leave in the summer and that's why Slot doesn't trust him(he certainly will ask to leave in January as well) ..
5155,Liverpool,Fuck. Exactly my reaction
5156,Liverpool,"Me : it’s going to be perfect being able to rotate Robbo and Kostas through the Real, City, Newcastle, Everton, Girona run. Ahhh shit. Annoying. Hopefully some minutes for Joe there if we don’t get a CB injury. "
5157,Liverpool,Always the same with him. Gets a decent run of games and then unfortunately gets injured. Very unlucky. 
5158,Liverpool,Really wanted him to start for Madrid and City games. I hope Robertson is up to the task. Honestly think we should stick Joey G there for 1 of the games. Maybe Madrid. My tired brain almost broke at the start for Madrid and city 😅 like why would you want them to start for the other team
5159,Liverpool,"Slot doesn't seem like he rates Gomez much for the fullback position probably because he's more defensive. I hope Slot rotates Robbo with Gomez regardless since he's the only Robbo backup now. But Gomez isn't that defensive at fullback Fuck it, Diaz fullback Gakpo LW Gomez problem is that he isn't good in the buildup play, same reason Endo isn't seeing any substantial game time"
5160,Liverpool,Fucking hell man. Come back stronger Kostas 
5161,Liverpool,"Joemez: hey, it's me again. 
I swear team needs a player like Joe. He can play as CB, RB, LB (still need some proper time to adapt). But he is serviceable. I thought he did really well at LB both defensively and offensively running up the touchline the last time he had to step in as cover. Injuries and consistency has been an issue for him sadly"
5162,Liverpool,Next season is time for a new first choice left back. Regardless of this injury Yep need a new young LB for the future and for either Robbo or Tsimikas to be moved on
5163,Liverpool,![gif](giphy|wc1KQzAaogA36jqBpJ|downsized) 
5164,Liverpool,"The Robbo hate on this sub is too much. Fickle bunch. Robbo is my boy, I have his signed shirt etc and love the working class hero since he joined 

That being said, I think we can recognise that we’ve defo run him into the ground over the years and that takes a toil on anyone. He’s not been at his best by his own impeccable highs for a season or so now but he is a perfectly decent LB by PL standards. Turning on a club legend after a month of playing poorly is this sub in a nutshell You're right, butbthat doesn't justify the Tsimikas abuse that happens in defence of Robbo. Nah he got destroyed by Saka and got embarrassed against Southampton. He's not up to the Real or City games"
5165,Liverpool,what the fu 
5166,Liverpool,Fuuuuck. 
5167,Liverpool,Can always recall Owen Beck for cover if needed. Can't recall loaned out players outside of a transfer window.
5168,Liverpool,Shiiiittt 
5169,Liverpool,Good thing Gomez stayed. So much flexibility on the back line with him there. 
5170,Liverpool,I wouldn't mind having Joey on for Madrid. We don't NEED to win that game but the City game is one we need the strongest lineup possible. 
5171,Liverpool,At least it’s short and we have Gomez 
5172,Liverpool,Robertson breathes a sigh of relief after his recent mistakes 
5173,Liverpool,"Knowing our luck, see you next year Kostas What luck? Dont bring that negativity here January 1st 2025 is still next year 🤞"
5174,Liverpool,Please can we sign either Kerkez or Ait-Nouri. 
5175,Liverpool,Unlucky. Esp w his improving form and Robbo’s dip. Hopefully Joemez can step up and stay fit cos we’ll need him for a bit. That LB position really needs to be strengthened in the summer tho. Been saying it for a while. 
5176,Liverpool,Ahh Kostas fucking hell 
5177,Liverpool,Andy Robertson is a club legend. He knows he needs to improve and will do everything in his power to do so and help us win. You know Kostas will be only rooting for his best performances while he is recovering too. 
5178,Liverpool,"Robertson redemption arc hopefully happens now, to silence the doubters (me included). "
5179,Liverpool,"Incoming 3 month injury now, starts with a short spell  

Sorry being a pessimistic dick "
5180,Liverpool,Short spell? Ankle injuries are anything but ‘short spell’ injuries. A month minimum. Robbo playing every three days is going to be a tough watch. Gomez has to be used there. 
5181,Liverpool,it begins 
5182,Liverpool,"knowing the club, short meaning he'll be back late january at this point. disaster this, robbo has been woeful this season and showing sings of aging. for the 1st time in his liverpool careerr tsimikas finally have a chance to usurp robbo for the 1st spot for LB.  one injury going into busy christmass period with Joe possibly playing in LB again. "
5183,Liverpool,Fuck sake! Robertson simply getting exposed in every game so far this season. Not good news at all! 
5184,Liverpool,"Laughable how deluded fans just blindly say Robertson shouldn’t come under rightful criticism in the face of blatantly shocking shows over not just the last two games but last two seasons at least. That’s why the fanbase is hated. At least have some fairness and be honest when our players have been shit. I've not seen a single fan saying that. 

There's been pretty much unanimous view that tsimi has been better this season. 

Perhaps you confuse people hating you with them hating the entire fan base?"
5185,Liverpool,It's so over 
5186,Liverpool,We're stuck with old bones Robertson 
5187,Liverpool,"Yay, more Robertson "
5188,Liverpool,Hope he heals up and can moved in the January window 
5189,Liverpool,We really need him back. At this point I want gomez at LB over robbo 
5190,Liverpool,"He looked good under Klopp, Why's it taken Robertson being in the worst form of his career to say he's been good? I think he's just finally started getting consistent playing time with Slot. Hard to prove your quality when you only play 1 out of every 4/5 games like he did with Klopp. That spell before Klopp fell on him and injured him, he was pretty good. Didn't miss Robertson at all. Don’t get it either. His crossing is genuinely fantastic and he loves getting stuck in defensively even though it works against him at times. he was serviceable. Because Robertson was amazing. He was top 10 left backs in the world at one point. Anyone filling for him will look bad. Because he’s actually been pretty mediocre. Just because you put in a few crosses and like to go to the ground for slide tackles doesn’t mean you’re good. He takes way too long on the ball, has no chemistry with the wingers he’s trying to pass with, his crossing stats are 23% on almost 300, while Robbo has 22% on over 1500. Against Robbo blows him out of the water on tackle ratio. Clears him on interceptions. These are just a few stats You forgotten the atalanta game so soon? No he didn't..."
5191,Liverpool,"Gomez tried to leave in the summer and that's why Slot doesn't trust him(he certainly will ask to leave in January as well) .. Not really i think slot just sees him as a centre half Did he ask to leave though? Or did the club offer him to Newcastle? All I heard was that we considered Gordon 70mil and Gomez would go the other way for 45mil it was more about balancing the books for Newcastle as they had some financial fair play issues but thank god we didn’t as Lucho and Gakpo have been great It's nothing to do with trust; Gomez has already played several games this season. For better or worse, Robertson is still our primary LB and despite his dip in form I think he should still be starting. Curious as to how you know Slot doesn’t trust him?  What is it with you folks and making shit up? Unless you have personal connections within the club no wah you would know this."
5192,Liverpool,Exactly my reaction 
5193,Liverpool,"Honestly think we should stick Joey G there for 1 of the games. Maybe Madrid. Bradley vs Mbappe is a worse matchup imo. better for MC as it's more important. Yeah I think Gomez needs to come in. I really feel for Robertson but I feel like he might get absolutely rinsed by Madrid. City I’m less worried about tbh. Bradley already struggling, would be insane to just smash his confidence by letting Mbappe run at him for 90 minutes."
5194,Liverpool,My tired brain almost broke at the start for Madrid and city 😅 like why would you want them to start for the other team Tbf after I typed it out I re-read it and was like what have I even just said 🤣 Dw the Greek scouser would never go near those corrupt clubs.
5195,Liverpool,"But Gomez isn't that defensive at fullback Weirdly he was more defensive at RB than LB, he was always looking to cut inside and have a go at goal from LB (need that Joemez goal plz)"
5196,Liverpool,"Fuck it, Diaz fullback Gakpo LW I was about to suggest Gakpo at LB, but either or"
5197,Liverpool,"Gomez problem is that he isn't good in the buildup play, same reason Endo isn't seeing any substantial game time He's better than Robbo or Tsimikas on build up, it's when he's in the final 3rd that it gets a little dicey"
5198,Liverpool,I thought he did really well at LB both defensively and offensively running up the touchline the last time he had to step in as cover. Injuries and consistency has been an issue for him sadly

5201,Liverpool,Turning on a club legend after a month of playing poorly is this sub in a nutshell Hardly a month. He's been playing poorly (compared to his old form) for close to 2 years now. it isnt turning on someone to want to win
5202,Liverpool,"You're right, butbthat doesn't justify the Tsimikas abuse that happens in defence of Robbo. Within 5 minutes of pretty much every game people are on Kostas neck."
5203,Liverpool,"Nah he got destroyed by Saka and got embarrassed against Southampton. He's not up to the Real or City games He had a very quick winger stop on a dime and cut inside him when he was sprinting back to cover, tsimikas definitely wouldn’t have fared any better.

Against saints he gave away the pen, was it even a pen? Rest of his game was fine. 

Why do football fans have to be so binary, they’re great or they’re crap and written off, nothing in between. Dumb."
5204,Liverpool,Can't recall loaned out players outside of a transfer window.

5211,Liverpool,"he was serviceable. He was genuinely good, not as good as Robbo at his best, but I'd say better than Robbo was at that point. Yeah not sure what these others are on about, serviceable is honestly being kind for a lot of his Klopp appearances. Shame though, he’s looked better having less to do under Slot."
5212,Liverpool,"Because Robertson was amazing. He was top 10 left backs in the world at one point. Anyone filling for him will look bad. Robertson was the best in the world, but the time Tsimikas was filling in his decline was beginning. A lot of the stick Tsimikas got was top defend Robertson more than it was about his performances, it's like Harvey Elliott in the 22/23 season he got a lot of stick for doing just fine in midfield because he probably should've been starting ahead of Henderson."

Robbo was definitely good under Klopp.

Last season Tsimi was performing better. But this season he has been terrific when playing, much better compared to his previous year forms."

5242,Liverpool,"Football fans are so naive.. Giving game time to a player who's actively trying to leave ahead of players who struggle to get minutes would send a wrong message to the dressing room and yeah he asked to leave in the summer What are you talking about?

Who is struggling to get minutes at lb? He isn’t actively trying to leave. He considered a proposal for more game time. Where did you get the notion he wants out? He didn't push to leave, he was open to the idea of it meant playing more. You've created an entire narrative in your head and you're running with it. No he didnt Benching someone of Gomez's skills and experiences, to play someone who has less experience and skills, against Madrid and City, would send a terrible message to the dressing room, and to the club.

And who would he be taking the place of?"
5243,Liverpool,But not every game while we're playing 3 times a week. He'll need resting at times.

5246,Liverpool,"Do we know when Trent is back? Will be on the bench for city?  I feel like the hope before the international break was that he'd be back for city, I don't know if there was some bad news I missed"
5247,Liverpool,keen to see how Slot exploits him not tracking back 
5248,Liverpool,Don’t remind me 😭 
5249,Liverpool,Mbappe doesn’t stand a chance against Bradley 
5250,Liverpool,Slot hasn't used Gomez LB once. He's obviously not a fam of it. Don't know why people keep bringing it up. He brought him on 1 or 2 times at LB. Klopp also didn’t until we had injury crisis and stopped with that after Robbo and Tsimi got back. We don’t really have any other option. If Trent is back especially.
5251,Liverpool,Just tell him it's Northern Ireland vs France 
5252,Liverpool,Joemez goal tomorrow inshallah 
5253,Liverpool,"Hope that changes tomorrow....

So we can be confident when we meet them again in knockout stages of UCL Even at our best they put up a fight against us like no other team, defeating them in UCL would be the perfect statement that we're all in this year"
5254,Liverpool,That 2022 final was such a gut punch. What final? It got cancelled because the fans couldn't get into the ground Fr…
5255,Liverpool,"We haven't beaten Madrid since that 2008/09 season. I'm tired of facing them almost every CL campaign. Hopefully we can get the W tomorrow When Gerrard, Torres and Alonso ran absolute circles around them and casillas played the game of his life saving them from one of the worst ass whoopings in club history 😍 I like facing them because they embody European football like no other team.  
  
Sick of losing to them though (OTOH, beating them 4-0 was phenomenal)."
5256,Liverpool,"This is why i feel the people that are fine with trent leaving to real madrid are plastics.

Real are our fucking antagonists. Our biggest roadblock in CL. Hell it wouldn't bother me as much if it was barca, bayern or atletico he was going to. Christ they broke salah's arm for god's sake. Yeah fuck Real. I hate them and want us to beat them even more than my desire to see us beat city-even though it doesn’t matter as much-beating them would make our players feel invincible. Their club and culture is the total opposite of what ours is like too Haven't seen anyone say they're fine with it mate, most are resigned to the fact that Madrid are the spoiled cunts of europe and manage to get what they want all the time."
5257,Liverpool,"So start Quansah and Konate and problem solved. /s if it wasn’t obvious 

Hope that stat changes tomorrow and we beat them. "

5285,Liverpool,"New supporters may not know his this guy turned his back on the club. He’s dead to me and most others from that time period. Tbf we apparently made promises that weren't kept, a sentiment which was also echoed by Torres a year later. I find it hard to hold too much of a grudge against anyone abandoning ship during the Hicks and Gillette era."
5286,Liverpool,Just add it to the pile of reasons to dislike Inter Miami. 
5287,Liverpool,The crossover us Argentina x LFC x Messi fans didn't ask for but silently needed. What?

5291,Liverpool,What? 
5292,Liverpool,"Exactly, and to play in Spain for Barcelona, not like was forcing a move to stay in England and play for United. Good players can’t leave without getting stick - people don’t realise that not everyone grows up dreaming of playing for Liverpool or in the PL.

We had horrible owners who showed time after time, the club wasn’t in their best interests - I was sad to see some of our best players leave but looking back, I get it. We were stagnating when Mascherano left and declining when Torres left, though that one hurt more as it was to a rival and only in the last few years have I been able to look at him fondly again"

5294,Liverpool,"Have no problem with Men in Blazers but this is the SIXTH interview they have with one of our players (Virg, Mo, Slot, Szob, Gakpo and now Grav).

I'd say it's pretty impressive for an ""out of mainstream"" media outlet. There pretty big in the US as far as I can tell. My FIL, who's American, introduced me to the pod. I'd never heard of it before then. They’re huge in the US, and rog I think is legitimately well loved by all players. There’s no “agenda” or trap questions from him, and while hes a bit corny just seems a fun guy to be around/talk to. 

Probably a huge relief to get an interview with him rather than say Gary Neville They ARE the mainstream of the US. They’re affiliated with NBC and everything. their show goes up on Peacock as well I think. They’re like the only big US soccer show that is separate from the matches themselves. They've spoken to Robbo within the past few months too. Rog is also a huge Everton fan so I’m willing to bet he has some local connections in the city as well"

At the end of the day, one should realize the market and economy in which they are doing business. People don’t understand finance and debt, and have been burnt by previous owners.

Yes, Glazers bought the club with a leveraged buyout. We did not do that.

Investing in a stadium is not the same as a leveraged buyout. It's the club who owns the stadium and the club that took the loan. The owners did not take a personal loan that they are making the club pay.

>We are literally the only club in football to pay owner taken loans. With scums, the debt is on club directly.

This is incorrect. The club is not paying for any loans the owners has taken for personal use. This is a gross misunderstanding if you think we are doing that. The owners of United took a personal loan to buy the club, and then made the club itself take over that loan and pay for it. Essentially, United owns a loan that the owners took to buy itself. So the club is paying for it's own shares that someone else got.

>Doesn't make any difference in end result

Yes, it does. This is literally how any business operates in the world. They take loans to make investments that increases the revenue. Our owners have actually not taken a single penny of revenue from the club since they bought it. The fact that investing in infrastructure increases the value of the club is a result of it earning more money and having a more valuable asset."

\[Swiss Ramble\] Zero owner funding for #LFC in the last 5 years. In fact, Liverpool were the only one of the Big Six to make a repayment of owner loans (£37m) and also the only club to increase the balance in its bank account. Took out a £72m bank loan. High capital expenditure at £132m. :

Did I ever say liverpool were paying for personal use? from where did you jump to that? **Owners took loan, invested that loan money in club and are paying from club revenue.** Do I need crayons to explain this? Now club itself is an investment in first place, and an appreciating asset, why is there a need to suck club revenue for something they are at least 10xing when they sell?

\> Our owners have actually not taken a single penny of revenue from the club since they bought it

False! [Why new RedBird investment would be for FSG, not Liverpool FC - Liverpool FC - This Is Anfield](https://www.thisisanfield.com/2023/02/why-new-redbird-investment-would-be-for-fsg-not-liverpool-fc/#:~:text=In%20March%202021%2C%20FSG%20confirmed,an%20indirect%20tie%20to%20Liverpool.)

Where did this money go? Did we ever get a dime for it? To explain simply, you are an entity with 2 houses worth 100$, now assume both houses are equal stake in your portfolio (50-50 $ each) for simplicity. Now you sell 11% of ownership entity. Where does 5.5$ that belongs to each house in portfolio go?

\[Swiss Ramble\] Zero owner funding for #LFC in the last 5 years. In fact, Liverpool were the only one of the Big Six to make a repayment of owner loans (£37m) and also the only club to increase the balance in its bank account. Took out a £72m bank loan. High capital expenditure at £132m. :

Did I ever say liverpool were paying for personal use? from where did you jump to that? **Owners took loan, invested that loan money in club and are paying from club revenue.** Do I need crayons to explain this? Now club itself is an investment in first place, and an appreciating asset, why is there a need to suck club revenue for something they are at least 10xing when they sell?

\> Our owners have actually not taken a single penny of revenue from the club since they bought it

False! [Why new RedBird investment would be for FSG, not Liverpool FC - Liverpool FC - This Is Anfield](https://www.thisisanfield.com/2023/02/why-new-redbird-investment-would-be-for-fsg-not-liverpool-fc/#:~:text=In%20March%202021%2C%20FSG%20confirmed,an%20indirect%20tie%20to%20Liverpool.)

Where did this money go? Did we ever get a dime for it? To explain simply, you are an entity with 2 houses worth 100$, now assume both houses are equal stake in your portfolio (50-50 $ each) for simplicity. Now you sell 11% of ownership entity. Where does 5.5$ that belongs to each house in portfolio go?

\> The owners of United took a personal loan to buy the club, and then made the club itself take over that loan and pay for it.

Thanks for googling what LBO is! "

5394,Liverpool,"Thanks, I hate it lol "
5395,Liverpool,"I saw a really interesting interview with a journalist I’ve completely forgotten the name of who summarised that part of the difficulties with these negotiations will be that everyone’s representative wants to be the last to negotiate because the likelihood is that the deal(s) that come first will create leverage.

Virgil negotiating last can say “I’m captain, I should earn as much as Trent”

Mo negotiating last can say “I’m the same age as Virg, why do I get a performance based contract?”

Trent negotiating last can say “Madrid want me, pay me as much as Mo or I’ll accept their offer”

It’s terrible timing, but could have been avoided. Yeah, realistically the behind the scenes turmoil has put us in a difficult spot re. This sort of thing. 

Edwards leaving, ward leaving after 5 minutes, schmadtke coming in to have a pint with his mate Jürgen, then klopp and everyone else deciding to leave too.

Remarkable that we've seen as little on pitch disruption as we have really. Put them all in the room together. Tell them there are two contracts on offer. We ""can't"" likely meet all their valuations of themselves, so get 2/3 locked down.

Also, everyone is so sure that Virgil stays, but idk. He's only ever spoken about ambition. If the club can't get the three most important people secured, what kind of ambition are we hoping for? He might say, nah fuck it, RM needs a CB too."
5396,Liverpool,"What a weird photo, his head seems huge! Must be the angle That's why he's the head coach Have you seen his head??? It is huge!"
5397,Liverpool,"Well he's got no say in anything like Klopp because he's just head coach.

But hey at least that's another thing he doesn't have to worry about so he doesn't get burnt out. Well i'm just guessing. But they will atleast ask his opinion about it right? how does klopp's role compare to slot's? That’s not remotely true"
5398,Liverpool,Needs more zest 
5399,Liverpool,Wish I felt like that 😂🥹😭 
5400,Liverpool,"He may look and sound chill, but I bet you he is unhappy about the contracts.

First, the noise will just keep getting worse and could risk it derailing the season. Second, he wants the best players he can get now and next year because this is his chance to win titles and establish himself. He could not care less about what could happen 3 years from now. "
5401,Liverpool,"Bit of an aside, but where has this ""chill guy"" meme come from? Idk, but I, strangely, was introduced to this meme by some friends last night, and now seeing it here is weird.


But they called it 'chill de cojones' (basically meaning you've got such big balls that nothing bothers you), so it makes me laugh. Also, it looks like they made it based on the Kevin James pose meme that did the rounds a while back.... An Instagram account, posted several slides for mindfulness.

There’s an additional members sale for every home league game, yes.

This game is for all members, but category A games (United, City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Spurs, Everton & the last home game of the season) are for members with 4+ home league credits from the previous season only.

He's just as hypocritical as the rest of them His book is excellent, he’s had such a life."
5486,Liverpool,"Wrighty having Mo’s back while Carra slags him off is kinda weird to see Yea. I love carra as a pundit, and I think amongst all the ex-players turn pundit, he's the most earnest and knowledgeable. PR-wish, he's not the best, but that's ok. 


That said, I do disagree with him, as in, I like what Salah is doing. And what Salah is doing shows that he still loves the club. He wants Salah to put the club first and focus on the club rather than a contract, but if Salah did that, it is 100% confirmed that he no longer wants to stay at the club. We have fostered a great culture where players play their hearts out regardless whether they want to leave or not. Salah voicing out like this shows that he WANTS to stay. "
5487,Liverpool,"It's hustling at the end of the day.

At its worst point last time round, Salah's agent was feeding the press that Salah might go to Man United or City if he didn't get a new contract. We're going to get a lot of odd phrases and suggestions and rumours throughout all of this, but it is designed to be eaten up. 

Contracts aren't negotiated via sound bytes to the media. This is smoke. I think a lot of people are misunderstanding that if Salah doesn’t sign he will go to Saudi. I don’t see that happening with how Salah is playing rn and his obsession with breaking records. 

I think there is a higher chance he stays in the league and signs with another club. Ramy's been weirdly calm about this all through these negotiations. Good sign unless Trump winning has just calmed him down independent of these negotiations."
5488,Liverpool,"Different take to 'I am dissapointed with Mo Salah.' I can honestly see both sides.

All this talk/speculation is definitely not what we need right before we play Real Madrid and City in the space of 3 days. 

But also the club is pissing around and not showing Salah the respect he's earned by getting his contract situation resolved as early as possible. He's one of our greatest ever players (and probably the best player in the world right now) and he's being treated as though he's dispensable when he definitely isn't.

I'm inclined to think Mo did the right thing, and hopefully it pushes the club to get things sorted as quickly as possible, but there's always a risk of it becoming a distraction when we have such an important week of football ahead."
5489,Liverpool,This is why everyone loves Ian Wright. Carra should be ashamed of himself. 
5490,Liverpool,Wrighty is a bigger Liverpool fan than Carra. 
5491,Liverpool,Ye I like Carra but he’s too loud mouthed sometimes he just needs to keep his trap shut 
5492,Liverpool,"Looking at the comments in this thread, Did people hear what Carra even said or did y’all only read the headline? "
5493,Liverpool,"I love Salah. I want the man to stay. But tbh I think it's likely disengenious to act like the club haven't put an offer out so he's more out than in. 
They're only gonna put an offer out when he's likely to accept and they also have two key contracts to sign elsewhere. 

He's negotiating. This is him negotiating. 
At the end of the day. If it was just about love for and desire to play for the club, he'd have the deal sorted ages ago. He clearly wants more money or longer etc. Well if the club sorted the contract situation a while ago it wouldn't have escalated as much, now the only thing mo can do is pressure the club into it.

And about the money he deserves to be on top of the wage chain, maybe with Van djik but Mo deserves it more imo. He's a world class player especially in his position and it makes sense to not wanting to lower his wages.

At the end of the day if Salah were to leave tomorrow a lot of European clubs would want him with the same wage. And a lot more Saudi clubs would want him for even more higher wages. It's not like Liverpool is the end of the road for him. he just wants to tell the fans it's not my choice if I leave. Obviously, this is a PR move to push for something. I highly doubt he would say this if the club can spin it in such a way that it's his fault the negotiations have stalled. So I believe, yes, he did ask for terms the club is hesitant to accept, but the club has not formally made even an inferior offer, nor responded much in negotiations. I'm guessing he feel insulted by the lack of effort by the club in trying to keep him, despite his contributions. 


It's like if you're the main man at your job, best at it, bringing in the numbers, and your bosses and colleagues praise you everyday. But behind close doors, they never want to raise your pay. So, once youre open to offers from the competitors, I bet you'd want to explain that you're not betraying the company, but you feel betrayed by the company's loyalty towards you. "
5494,Liverpool,"How does he have a better, more sane and respectful opinion than the bullshit Carragher spewed. "
5495,Liverpool,"Is he really putting it out *all* there? If he's being so open, him tell us how much money he's demanding. "
5496,Liverpool,"Take note Carragher, tosser. "
5497,Liverpool,This is one neutral analysis from people who in the business. Ian Wright knows the game and makes a lot of sense 
5498,Liverpool,"Mo's gonna go to real madrid or barca then call it quits. if the clubs not investing, it means they're looking for someone else to replace him. if he goes, i reckon half the team will go, but if he wants to stay he will. "
5499,Liverpool,Ian Wright spit facts whereas Jamie spit non-sense and saliva. 
5500,Liverpool,The issue with Salah he is not rated high enough with both the club and coach and is replaceable while Salah sees himself as superstar. This is due to the fact that a club won’t wait until the player is almost free to renew his contract if they think he is a valuable asset to the team. 
5501,Liverpool,The reason Salah said that in January he can go shopping and other clubs can come knocking.. So there is a tight deadline window. 
5502,Liverpool,"Apart from the time he said that players who refuse international games should be forced to talk to parents of dead children and then last week on the overlap when asked about Arsenal players pulling out he went on with the ""it's the smart thing to do, you have to do that to avoid injuries"".

He's just as hypocritical as the rest of them I'd just point out that there are 10 years between these two events you mentioned. People are allowed to change their opinions on things, especially given how much of a topic player game time is these days. It's very harsh to call someone a hypocrite for changing their mind over the course of a decade, in fact it would be much worse if that were not the case. I change my mind 5 times a conversation sometimes. It's not hypocritical to think about something more and change your opinion. The two comments are about a decade apart. He said that? That's outrageous, what do parents of dead children have to do with football."
5503,Liverpool,"His book is excellent, he’s had such a life. "
5504,Liverpool,"Yea. I love carra as a pundit, and I think amongst all the ex-players turn pundit, he's the most earnest and knowledgeable. PR-wish, he's not the best, but that's ok.

We have fostered a great culture where players play their hearts out regardless whether they want to leave or not. Salah voicing out like this shows that he WANTS to stay.  Neville and Carragher both are PGMOL plants in the punditry media. From time to time they seemingly talk openly, but when it comes to defending the FA and referees, they step up. Nah Carra is a massive sellout. Every year he seems to be more of a PGMOL/Sky corporate man.

When he initially became a pundit, I liked him a lot, but you can see that he seems to progressively get more anti-Liverpool as time goes on, in an effort to not appear biased. He tries so hard to not appear biased for Liverpool that he actually ends up being biased against Liverpool.

I think the guy's a massive bellend now tbf, has no integrity and does whatever his Sky bosses tell him he has to Carra literally said give him his money not long ago and now he's being all cryarse about Salah saying something makes no sense."
5505,Liverpool,"I think a lot of people are misunderstanding that if Salah doesn’t sign he will go to Saudi. I don’t see that happening with how Salah is playing rn and his obsession with breaking records. 

I think there is a higher chance he stays in the league and signs with another club. The question now is who wants to sign a 32 year old with one of the highest wages in the PL? Arsenal have Saka who is considerably younger & already on similar wages. Leaves you about City & Chelsea left but City is facing a problem with an aging squad so don't know if theyd want another aging player. So thats pretty much Chelsea only and wonder if both would want that reunion.

So its pretty much a lose lose situation for both parties to part ways but both are playing a game of chicken to see who folds first to gain the upper hand He isn't going to another premier league club... That's 100% sure... I am mkre inclined that he would go either France PSG or Barcelona or Italy Juventus or Inter There's not a lot of viable options within the league for him though if he wants to continue playing at the highest level and get the money he wants.

Maybe he backs himself to push a Newcastle into serious territory, but beyond that I don't really see what club he could join."
5506,Liverpool,Ramy's been weirdly calm about this all through these negotiations. Good sign unless Trump winning has just calmed him down independent of these negotiations. What's this got to do with Trump?
5507,Liverpool,"I can honestly see both sides.

All this talk/speculation is definitely not what we need right before we play Real Madrid and City in the space of 3 days. 

But also the club is pissing around and not showing Salah the respect he's earned by getting his contract situation resolved as early as possible. He's one of our greatest ever players (and probably the best player in the world right now) and he's being treated as though he's dispensable when he definitely isn't.

I'm inclined to think Mo did the right thing, and hopefully it pushes the club to get things sorted as quickly as possible, but there's always a risk of it becoming a distraction when we have such an important week of football ahead. "
5508,Liverpool,"Well if the club sorted the contract situation a while ago it wouldn't have escalated as much, now the only thing mo can do is pressure the club into it.

And about the money he deserves to be on top of the wage chain, maybe with Van djik but Mo deserves it more imo. He's a world class player especially in his position and it makes sense to not wanting to lower his wages.

At the end of the day if Salah were to leave tomorrow a lot of European clubs would want him with the same wage. And a lot more Saudi clubs would want him for even more higher wages. It's not like Liverpool is the end of the road for him. he just wants to tell the fans it's not my choice if I leave. Yea, and I bet Liverpool rivals would be waiting to tempt him right now. At best, they get a great player. At worst, they deny Liverpool from their current star talisman. "
5509,Liverpool,"Obviously, this is a PR move to push for something. I highly doubt he would say this if the club can spin it in such a way that it's his fault the negotiations have stalled. So I believe, yes, he did ask for terms the club is hesitant to accept, but the club has not formally made even an inferior offer, nor responded much in negotiations. I'm guessing he feel insulted by the lack of effort by the club in trying to keep him, despite his contributions. 


It's like if you're the main man at your job, best at it, bringing in the numbers, and your bosses and colleagues praise you everyday. But behind close doors, they never want to raise your pay. So, once youre open to offers from the competitors, I bet you'd want to explain that you're not betraying the company, but you feel betrayed by the company's loyalty towards you.  You'd also feel crap though if you asked for £350k per week for 3 years but then your employer turns round and offers you £280k for 2 years.

  
So it's important that they talk before making the offer. It also sends a signal to Trent and Van Dyke. They need to be careful and manage the business correctly. 

  
They'd lose more money buying a new player to replace him than paying him whatever he's asking for, I'm sure. But what happens when Van Dyke, Trent, Allison, Konate, Diaz and at this rate potentially Gravenberch all turn around and want more because they also believe we aren't winning without them etc. 

It's one of them. It's incredibly complicated and anyone not accepting that isn't switched on imo."
5510,Liverpool,"I'd just point out that there are 10 years between these two events you mentioned. People are allowed to change their opinions on things, especially given how much of a topic player game time is these days. It's very harsh to call someone a hypocrite for changing their mind over the course of a decade, in fact it would be much worse if that were not the case. "
5511,Liverpool,I change my mind 5 times a conversation sometimes. It's not hypocritical to think about something more and change your opinion. The two comments are about a decade apart. 
5512,Liverpool,"He said that? That's outrageous, what do parents of dead children have to do with football. I misremembered. It wasn't dead childrn it was [dead soldiers](https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/world-cup-2014-ian-wright-says-footballers-who-don-t-want-to-play-for-england-should-be-ordered-to-ring-the-parents-of-a-soldier-who-has-died-in-afghanistan-9559638.html)

Still a batshit thing to say, and then turn around and act like it's the right choice when they play for your club."
5513,Liverpool,"Neville and Carragher both are PGMOL plants in the punditry media. From time to time they seemingly talk openly, but when it comes to defending the FA and referees, they step up. Well yea, that's true. What I liked about him is that he seems really into football, like he really studies the shit. The others just seem to rest on the laurels that they were ex-players too much."

Which is why it’s maddening that we haven’t sorted this yet “A 32 year old with high wages” lol. You’re missing important context that this is arguably the PL GOAT we’re talking about here I can see city going for it but either way I would be very surprised if Mo goes to Saudi if he doesn’t sign here. City renewed an aging, injury prone player in De Bruyne. And with high wages too. They'll sign Salah in a heartbeat if given the chance. If Salah doesn't want to leave the PL City or Chelsea would snap him up in a heartbeat, the 40-60m outlay on wages would be nothing to them. I mean he's in the form of his life, scoring and assisting for fun at 32 years old, his numbers are insane right now. I don't know if we live in the same planet if you think clubs won't be interested in having Salah for free, signing a 3-4 year contract at another big club and then going to Saudi possibly for a fee to recoup some funds. They will 100% want a 35 year old Mo just because of his name, that's another reason why I'm dumbfounded we didn't do a deal yet considering that get out of jail option is always there if his legs fall off at 34 or something. 



The only loser is Liverpool FC no matter which way you twist it, letting a player like that leave for absolutely nothing and then having to spend the transfer fee and wages on a few players just to match his output. 

Losing players for free is already a dumb strategy we do, but letting Salah VVD and Trent all leave for free is just a mind blowing amount of incompetence, like how much money in transfer fees/wages are we going to spend and then not even be at the same level. He’ll be 33 at the start of next season. Who wants to sign a 33 yo for 350k+ a week. He going to ask for something stupid. I hope he stays but I don’t want it to handicap the club."

Do you not remember the Diaz goal against Tottenham that was wrongly disallowed? Barely saw a reply on Sky and the pundits barely spoke about it.

Coupled with if you already have someone on that identical position earning around same wages already (like Saka), his options that he can go to significantly dwindles.

It makes sense to us to extend as if we lose him we have to find a replacement right now, but for other teams they don't need  an 'additional' +350k wage player on the RW  right now"

All the Italian teams are broke (the highest fee paid in Italy this past year was ""only"" €35m), Madrid (Rodrygo) & Barcelona (Yamal) already have very good young players in his position, Bayern aren't giving the wages he wants to a player his age as they've stated they want their squad to get younger, and he's already said he'd leave England if he ever stopped being a Liverpool player.

So please do tell, outside of PSG (who he doesn't want to join), what ""top"" team is left for him? Dude if he leaves Liverpool, he will have to compromise with wages outside of England... Don't forget that Salal is very ambitious. His main priority is to get to a team that can compete for the league and CL... 

For the Spanish League the only option is Barcelona but I don't se them getting Salah since Laporta is promoting Yamal and this age his keeping his confidence is huge. Salah is at an age and level that can't compromise and back down for a younger player ...  Although Salah would be great with Flick. Real is out of the question... It against the current transfer policy to go for Salah. They also don't need to do that. Like Man City although one of the best players in the world and best RW, both teams have their pride. 


Bayern would have been an option but I am not so sure. Especially with how they treated Mane. They also won't be able to pay huge amount. There is already Kane. Still it wouldn't be that much out of the question though...


Then there is PSG. That is a very likely destination...


Finally Italy is a league that he is familiar with and would suit him... The only teams I see capable of getting him are Inter or Juventus... At this moment Inter is the best and the only one that can seriously compete for both the League and CL. I could see Salah compromising his wage for inter...

I would say that Inter , PSG and Bayern would be the only ones that could mve Salah. ( I think Barcelona would have been his priority but I feel Barcelona wouldn't go. No money and promotion of Yamal) I do think he would be ok with signing with another PL league if Liverpool does not work out. 

Italy may be broke today but next summer is a new year. The $35M fee you mentioned would basically cover Mo's wages. It’s funny to me that people are ruling out Italian clubs when Juve literally bought a 33 year old Ronaldo for €100M on a 3 year deal"
5566,Liverpool,"And Juve are now €300m in debt, something they weren't when they signed him. I used Juve as an example. Getting Salah at 400k/week with 0 transfer fees means an outlay of <65M over a period of 3 years."
5567,Liverpool,"And after that deal they pretty much closed their wallet to those deals. My point was they had to pay 100M for Ronaldo and then probably another 100M in wages for 3 years. They have to pay no transfer fee for Salah, only the wages which would add up to <80M even for a 3 year contract."
5568,Liverpool,"Nah, the stuff you have said its naive, disgreement or not. Suit yourself man"
5569,Liverpool,"Dude if he leaves Liverpool, he will have to compromise with wages outside of England... Don't forget that Salal is very ambitious. His main priority is to get to a team that can compete for the league and CL... 

For the Spanish League the only option is Barcelona but I don't se them getting Salah since Laporta is promoting Yamal and this age his keeping his confidence is huge. Salah is at an age and level that can't compromise and back down for a younger player ...  Although Salah would be great with Flick. Real is out of the question... It against the current transfer policy to go for Salah. They also don't need to do that. Like Man City although one of the best players in the world and best RW, both teams have their pride. 


Bayern would have been an option but I am not so sure. Especially with how they treated Mane. They also won't be able to pay huge amount. There is already Kane. Still it wouldn't be that much out of the question though...


Then there is PSG. That is a very likely destination...


Finally Italy is a league that he is familiar with and would suit him... The only teams I see capable of getting him are Inter or Juventus... At this moment Inter is the best and the only one that can seriously compete for both the League and CL. I could see Salah compromising his wage for inter...

I would say that Inter , PSG and Bayern would be the only ones that could mve Salah. ( I think Barcelona would have been his priority but I feel Barcelona wouldn't go. No money and promotion of Yamal) "
5570,Liverpool,"I do think he would be ok with signing with another PL league if Liverpool does not work out. 

Italy may be broke today but next summer is a new year. The $35M fee you mentioned would basically cover Mo's wages. >I do think he would be ok with signing with another PL league if Liverpool does not work out.

Who? 

Because looking at the other ""Top 6"" sides, City doesn't suit him whatsoever, United are a cluster fuck, Arsenal already have Saka, Spurs are Spurs, and Chelsea aren't signing players his age or paying their players the wages he wants.

That *maybe* leaves Villa & Newcastle, but they fail with the ""consistently challenge for the Champions League"" part and are also massively in danger on PSR.

>Italy may be broke today but next summer is a new year.

They will still be broke next year as well, if not more so."
5571,Liverpool,It’s funny to me that people are ruling out Italian clubs when Juve literally bought a 33 year old Ronaldo for €100M on a 3 year deal Are you aware of what’s happened to Juventus in the past 2 years?? 💀
5572,Liverpool,I used Juve as an example. Getting Salah at 400k/week with 0 transfer fees means an outlay of <65M over a period of 3 years.

5576,Liverpool,"Are you aware of what’s happened to Juventus in the past 2 years?? 💀 Yes. I'm using Juve as an example. If Juve could come up with 100M for Ronaldo as transfer fee with probably 400-500k per week for a 33 year old, other Italian clubs could definitely take on a 400k per week player without any transfer fee"

Yeah I feel like drawing in that manner will destroy them more mentally before Sunday than just straight up losing would have ![gif](giphy|l3vRlT2k2L35Cnn5C) It's got to be so deflating. 3-0 up and you think finally the bad run has come to an end...

5592,Liverpool,Feyenoord fans are everywhere tonight in manchester Big week for Slot. He was always destined to go against City this week. A proper club. I was at the Christmas markets earlier. They were quite rambunctious. Hope they stick around for the weekend and rile up city some more.

I still think it's mental that he left Sporting midway through the season like that when they are so high up the league tables like us for a bottom table United. €$£ He wanted to manage in the Premier League for years. Had an interview with Chelsea when they went for Poch. Tried to get a move to us. Was willing to go to West Ham etc. 

The Prem has pull and United has £££"
5596,Liverpool,Feyenoord fans with an Arne Slot chant followed by YNWA is amazing.

5649,Liverpool,You think pep has that gash on his face because the old sheikh daddy leathered him? 
5650,Liverpool,That will feel like a loss. What a gut punch. Perfect

5652,Liverpool,"Sorry but throwing away a 3-0 lead in 15 minutes at home to Feyenoord isn't something that happens just because you don't have the best DM in the world. Something is deeply wrong in that City team. Word on the street is that some officials are looking into the financial dealings of the owners? Maybe it's just hearsay but i don't know. Been saying this (check my comment history if you fancy).

Guardiola is supposedly one of the best in the world, he should be able to steady that ship."
5653,Liverpool,Gabriel basically trolling Gyokeres by saying he cant see him… these guys are so unlikeable What's odd is... don't Arsenal want Gyokeres?

5655,Liverpool,"In what world is that a penalty? They both stretch for the ball. No one had control. VAR checked the shirt badges. It was a forgone conclusion from there Penalty given to a club who lives from dirty money, no surprise there."
5656,Liverpool,EVERYONE POINT AND LAUGH AT CITY  
5657,Liverpool,Anything but a win at the weekend is unacceptable 
5658,Liverpool,City might never win again 
5659,Liverpool,City giving up a 3 nil lead is better than them losing by a goal lol Still time for both to happen
5660,Liverpool,"I turned the city match off when they went 3-0 up, what happened? They put De Bruyne on, weirdly enough Sir we bow to you The best 15 minutes of football I’ve seen since Sunday afternoon"
5661,Liverpool,"Wtf happened with City game? Lol. Their defense looks weak. We have a strong chance on Saturday to beat them. We play them on Sunday.

Just so you don’t get too excited a day early! 😅 Thankfully Slot is there, because Klopp would still totally settle in for a draw"
5662,Liverpool,All fell apart as soon as KDB came on. Looks shite of late. His legs have gone. He's become like what Hendo and Fab were for us in their final season.

5665,Liverpool,"With how shite they've been, got this funky feeling that playing us will snap these city players out of whatever funk they've been in.. hope I'm wrong and we smash them. Got to be all over them from the get go, could absolutely thrash them if we’re at it Could have said that after the first spurs loss.

Or when they had the previous champions league game.

Or the rematch against spurs.

Or tonight. Even if they don’t suddenly become good there’s no way pep will make them play with a high line and space in behind on the weekend"

5677,Liverpool,Let's talk about six baby 
5678,Liverpool,"Trent has a big decision to make.

Does he want to be Steven Gerrard?

Or Steve MacManaman?

A choice of two Steve's, I know which one I'd pick. Or Stevie Wonder. Signed Sealed Delivered. What about Steve Alexander-Arnold? Be your own Steve. Truly tho he wouldn't get the love there at all like he does here. I absolutely understand wanting a challenge, but most players don't go there and have such quick success like Bellingham so hopefully he isn't just listening to Jude. 


He should talk to Owen (can't believe I'm typing that out) or Rush when he went to Juve. I bet they'd give him good perspective about the grass seems greener. Even fucking Beckham would probably give it to him straight and say stay with your boyhood club. It's a fucking circus at Real and he could easily be turned into a scapegoat if he isn't lighting it up every week. Steve Mulhern? The thing they all forget is that they are lauded by the supporters and the coaching staff.

If they leave for Madrid or Barca the head coach won't be building the team around them or to best suit their style they will be just another squad player who must fit into their plans. 

This is why when the few that have gone on haven't necessarily done well.

Look at MacManaman, I'll never forgive him for procrastinating and running down his contract and in recent years he's admitted he felt like an imposter. I remember how he was used by Madrid too. A bang on starter for us and a sub for them. Of course he was there a while and he got his chances. But the point remains the same.
Same for Owen btw.

Ok so you want to leave your boyhood club? Well that's shit but do you know what's shitter? Running down your contact so the club can't reinvest. Yeh, YNWA lad.

Let's hope I'm wrong. And his silence means he's not going anywhere.

I'm not one of those who has accepted Trent leaving as a fait accompli . Good luck to ya etc.

Most of us would have given our left bollock to represent our club & our city so I don't have the stoic attitude that some seem to have accepted.

Lifetime legend at Liverpool to just another player at Madrid & the latter cancels put the former. MacManaman is insufferable. Absolute twat He wants the ballon dor mate /s Stevies choice Tbf if he stays, he won't be gerrard. Nobody could be gerrard bro. A bit of a false equivalency.  Trent has won damn near every trophy he could while at Liverpool.  If he decides to go elsewhere, I'd hope he gets treated as the legend he is."
5679,Liverpool,"God dammit all I want for Christmas is contract extensions from the boys

I'm ok with being an idiot in this case. Not gonna lie, I did. Haha Turn to nightmode. It’s cosier here. Stop stalking my private life ffs I wiped 😓 I did not fall for it this time. I wiped. Twice Absolutely hate this. Subs should ban it"
5682,Liverpool,"""Switching the pass/play"", anyone? In the video that is on the same post that's exactly what the joke is. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/DCzfVaAiGnQ/?igsh=a2MwaWJkcTMxNGRo Fan base is like a touch paper at the moment regarding these contracts lol anything from anyone and everyone gets their inspecto-specs on and starts figuring out what the twitch of the facial muscle means with regards to any mental strain that may have resulted from contract negotiations.

I feel like the subtlety of that joke may be lost at the moment lol There’s no way though that they dont know how that could come off That was my thought too…but he knows what he is doing, haha! Definitely what I think was intended"
5683,Liverpool,"He’s not even going to make the switch to Pixel, would he?! "
5684,Liverpool,"Carra: 'I am disappointed with Trent Alexander Arnold. This week should be about Real Madrid and Man City, instead he decides to do an interview with a sponsor and talk about the new Google Pixel.' "
5685,Liverpool,"Advertisers thinking my first thought after seeing this would be to buy a new phone..

Weird ass people The point is to associate their product with things you like and a sense of quality, excellence, and prestige Is this the first ad you’ve ever seen Interesting, you literally think basically all companies flush money down the drain on advertising and that you know better My first thought is to buy a new rightback :( we're talking about and combing through their advertisement, that's their entire goal"
5686,Liverpool,"Call me crazy but Trent stays. It’s his boyhood club, he’s the Gerrard but more successful Alright, you're crazy. If Trent stays I'll be more surprised than I've ever been about any bit of LFC transfer news. There’s no way we’d let his contract run down two years, never mind 7 months. He’s gone mate"
5687,Liverpool,"If he stays, this is elite fuckery from the lad and this will be a running joke for the coming years.

If he actually leaves, this post is going to come back to bite him, he's going to face a massive amount of resentment from the fanbase.

I know switch could mean a switch of play as well, but Trent and the Pixel marketing team need to read the room lmao. Nobody will remember this by next week lol. if he ever  actually makes the switch some rando’s gonna dig it up and have a rad Reddit post but that’s about it Jesus lad, this won’t even be a footnote in the story. so you're saying that if he actually leaves, an ad he made with a google pixel phone is gonna burn his legacy I think you’re way overreacting It ain't that deep If it is the latter, I will smash every Pixel I come across"
5688,Liverpool,"This kind of wankery will not go down well if he actually does make the move. There’s currently better players at this club who are out of contract who are more desperate to stay so it’s funny he thinks he’s the dogs bollocks just because he’s on Madrid’s radar. 

There isn’t a savior complex with Trent like there was with Stevie or Jurgen or even Mo so he needs to understand that as much as it would hurt to lose a club legend like him in his prime, he’s just going to go down as another spoke in the Klopp wheel whereas the likes of Mo and Virgil will go down as pillars of this football club who will attach their entire legacy to this football club and actually feel privileged to do so. Meh I don't like the post, but what i don't like even more are fans trying to discount Trents contributions because he may leave, that's nonsense,  he's among the best in his position since he was a teenager. 


Also, people should be mad at the club for not renewing earlier instead of blaming players. VVD was making comments about the lack of signings and now we have 3 of our best players about to leave for free. It's 100% on the club for not getting these deals done and convincing the players to stay. Weird take. We dont even know what this photo is about. Plus Trent is doing absolutely nothing wrong if he wishes to try playing for a different team, it's completely up to him and either the club has been too slow in 1) offering him a new contract or (2) not selling him in the Summer, if  what i think has happened is that he told them a long time ago he won't be renewing. Agreed.

Maybe I’m looking too much into it, but this is the first thing he’s said that’s made me think he might be staying. Surely he wouldn’t be out there making jokes about joining Madrid if he was actually doing it? It feels a lot like rubbing it in. That’d be a bit of a “fuck you” to the fans.

I’d like to think he wouldn’t do that. He’ll end up being regarded the same as macca. 

We already have great cover in Bradley so he won’t be missed that much. 

Just a shame because like Klopp said to courts “if you stay they’ll build a statue of you, if you leave you’re just another number. The caption is referencing the ad he’s featuring in, in which a ball gets kicked to him and he gets asked to ‘switch it’. It’s a reference to his passing ability and not his contract situation lol Lol calm the fuck down. Trent is absolutely a club legend regardless what happens with his contract.  Blame our shit owners for letting it go this far without sorting him, Mo and Virg. Calm down bud, it’s just an ig post"
5689,Liverpool,"I'm taking the trolling as a ""don't worry guys, I'm not leaving"" lmao I want to believe"
5690,Liverpool,He’s got a lot of work to do if he wants a worse exit than Hendo 
5691,Liverpool,"There is only one quote here to quote.

""I told him stay here and they will end up building a statue in your honour. Go somewhere else, to Barcelona, to Bayern Munich, to Real Madrid, and you will be just another player."" "
5692,Liverpool,"Oh, my! Some of us here certainly hold some strong opinions about Trent.🍿 "
5693,Liverpool,I don’t get it Same but I was hesitant to admit it 😂
5694,Liverpool,Do none of yous not understand that a 'switch' is a long cross field ball. Of which Trent is famous for. Oh have a day off. We’re allowed to interpret things differently you know…
5695,Liverpool,He's been shit this season. 
5696,Liverpool,Weird caption to put if you ask me. 
5697,Liverpool,"Wonder if Trent had any input on that post

Wouldn't surprise me if it was all sent over from Google advertising to Trent's PR team to schedule the post. Some advertising bloke thinking he's dead clever for that line...and to be fair it is driving engagement "
5698,Liverpool,Surely this makes him more likely to stay? Massive prick if he’s trolling US. Now I’m typing this I realise it’s about switching the play lol 
5699,Liverpool,"I think he trolling Madrid more than us. We don’t want him to make the switch, they do. 

He could go one step further like Griezmann and do a documentary about his decision and then stay 😂. That was real next level trolling. "
5700,Liverpool,sign the contracttt 
5701,Liverpool,Ok. He's signed a deal. Surely. You don't make this gag with a club sponsor otherwise. Lmao
5702,Liverpool,Not gonna lie I was getting pretty mad trying to swipe to the left to see the other pic finally 5 min later I realized it was only 1 
5703,Liverpool,"Whatever he does, he’s done more for LFC than most players have. He could be a true legend if he stays but there’s always that part of players that wants to test themselves. I bid him good luck if he goes. "
5704,Liverpool,He will never leave Liverpool.   He's red forever. 
5705,Liverpool,Man wtf I swiped again 
5706,Liverpool,"Trent wants to stay, but thinks he can win more trophies and individual accolades elsewhere, so he wants to be highest payed player, which from his perspective isn’t outlandish. Young local lad, future captain, game winner. But I can’t help but naively feeling that if he settles for less money, then VVD and salahs contracts become easier as a result "
5707,Liverpool,"Slotts came in and confidently took on the role of “next manager after Klopp” which was universally expected to take a while and see a dip in form. And knowing that he backed himself, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s thinking something like “if salah goes that’s not ideal but I’ll manage, I’m in charge of a rebuild” he might want someone who stays wide more, tracks back more, anything, he’s took this job knowing he has time to reshape us the way HE wants, he’s already transformed grav, trent and gakpo. He might see replacing Klopp and replacing salah as the same task. It’s not his fault he’s started so well and salahs proved himself to be the exception to his new employers rule. 
Either way, we thought Klopp was irreplaceable, especially so quickly, so as undeniably irreplaceable salah is, a different profile of player may work better than we expect under slotts management.
Just in case anyone reads this and thinks I’m deludedly coping with life without salah, I 100% agree that salah must stay and losing him is unforgivable…..
But give slott the benefit of a replacement that he’s undoubtedly had lined up since signing "
5708,Liverpool,He’s allowed to expand his horizons. I’d be sad but won’t think less of the guy if he wanted to leave. 
5709,Liverpool,I'm not finding this funny 
5710,Liverpool,That's disrespectful to fans.

5713,Liverpool,"I don’t think this has anything to do with him leaving haha. Making a joke about switching the play because Trent does that all the fucking time Well, the first thing that came to my mind was switching clubs. It’s an advert, subjective but let ppl have their view. I’m sure many ppl think the same as you, but others shared my thoughts too"
5714,Liverpool,The money he makes from the interaction on this post will substitute the extra he might earn elsewhere... 
5715,Liverpool,"This is actually not funny at all if he moves. Like no one’s gona begrudge him for moving, but to make a joke out of it? Plenty will begrudge him for leaving on a free."
5716,Liverpool,My heart skipped a beat thinking he’d say switched to… Real Madrid 😢 If he wanted to switch he wouldn't make it so obvious. He's just trolling and more likely to renew now. Y the downvotes

5721,Liverpool,"Or Stevie Wonder. Signed Sealed Delivered. Too soon. Or maybe not?

We shall see.

(Please Trent don't be a bellend) You mean pursue a career as a referee? Stevie Nicks a goal. Trent's vision is his defining asset.

Just like Stevie Wonder. Or Stone Cold Steve Austin, whippin somebody's ass Trent’s not faking being blind though"
5722,Liverpool,What about Steve Alexander-Arnold? Be your own Steve. There's a Steve for every occasion.
5723,Liverpool,"Truly tho he wouldn't get the love there at all like he does here. I absolutely understand wanting a challenge, but most players don't go there and have such quick success like Bellingham so hopefully he isn't just listening to Jude. 


He should talk to Owen (can't believe I'm typing that out) or Rush when he went to Juve. I bet they'd give him good perspective about the grass seems greener. Even fucking Beckham would probably give it to him straight and say stay with your boyhood club. It's a fucking circus at Real and he could easily be turned into a scapegoat if he isn't lighting it up every week. Something tells me Beckham has zero regrets about any move that improved his fame/profile In the same way as you say he shouldn't just be listening to Bellingham, he also shouldn't just listen to Owen/Rush. There are plenty of flops and plenty of successful players who have gone to Madrid. At the end of the day he just has to decide whether he backs himself to become the latter. Let's just all hope he opts out of the move. But it shouldn't just be because Owen flopped so maybe he will too."
5724,Liverpool,"Steve Mulhern? Nah, Steve Buscemi, I reckon he lives fairly comfortably. Steven Caulker? The 4th best Steve in a room of 3 Steves."
5725,Liverpool,"The thing they all forget is that they are lauded by the supporters and the coaching staff.

If they leave for Madrid or Barca the head coach won't be building the team around them or to best suit their style they will be just another squad player who must fit into their plans. 

This is why when the few that have gone on haven't necessarily done well.

Look at MacManaman, I'll never forgive him for procrastinating and running down his contract and in recent years he's admitted he felt like an imposter. I remember how he was used by Madrid too. A bang on starter for us and a sub for them. Of course he was there a while and he got his chances. But the point remains the same.
Same for Owen btw.

Ok so you want to leave your boyhood club? Well that's shit but do you know what's shitter? Running down your contact so the club can't reinvest. Yeh, YNWA lad.

Let's hope I'm wrong. And his silence means he's not going anywhere.

I'm not one of those who has accepted Trent leaving as a fait accompli . Good luck to ya etc.

Most of us would have given our left bollock to represent our club & our city so I don't have the stoic attitude that some seem to have accepted.

Lifetime legend at Liverpool to just another player at Madrid & the latter cancels put the former. I desperately want Trent to stay and think it'd be a mistake for him to leave, but I don't think he can be blamed for deliberately running down his contract. Amid all the chaos, FSG dropped the ball on renewal deals with him, Virgil, and Mo and put itself in this situation."
5726,Liverpool,MacManaman is insufferable. Absolute twat 
5727,Liverpool,He wants the ballon dor mate /s 
5728,Liverpool,Stevies choice 
5729,Liverpool,"Tbf if he stays, he won't be gerrard. Nobody could be gerrard bro. You're not wrong, I just meant in terms of his legacy at the club."
5730,Liverpool,"A bit of a false equivalency.  Trent has won damn near every trophy he could while at Liverpool.  If he decides to go elsewhere, I'd hope he gets treated as the legend he is. Nah."
5731,Liverpool,"If Mo doesn’t get a contract I think Trent is gone.

He probably also weighed up that decision and decided he doesn’t want to be dragging a squad of above average players his whole career to try to fight for trophies. Like Stevie did for most of his.

I wouldn’t blame him tbh, why would you want that fate in modern football. "

5762,Liverpool,"Meh I don't like the post, but what i don't like even more are fans trying to discount Trents contributions because he may leave, that's nonsense,  he's among the best in his position since he was a teenager. 


Also, people should be mad at the club for not renewing earlier instead of blaming players. VVD was making comments about the lack of signings and now we have 3 of our best players about to leave for free. It's 100% on the club for not getting these deals done and convincing the players to stay. Renewing is a two way street, we don't know what the club or players have been doing here. its always from accounts made semi recent too, guy isnt just ‘a spoke in klopps wheel’ like fuck is that? [deleted]"
5763,Liverpool,"Weird take. We dont even know what this photo is about. Plus Trent is doing absolutely nothing wrong if he wishes to try playing for a different team, it's completely up to him and either the club has been too slow in 1) offering him a new contract or (2) not selling him in the Summer, if  what i think has happened is that he told them a long time ago he won't be renewing. Fine, but it’s still in bad taste for him to be posting this. It’s such a clear allusion to RM."
5764,Liverpool,"Agreed.

Maybe I’m looking too much into it, but this is the first thing he’s said that’s made me think he might be staying. Surely he wouldn’t be out there making jokes about joining Madrid if he was actually doing it? It feels a lot like rubbing it in. That’d be a bit of a “fuck you” to the fans.

I’d like to think he wouldn’t do that. "
5765,Liverpool,"He’ll end up being regarded the same as macca. 

We already have great cover in Bradley so he won’t be missed that much.

5766,Liverpool,"The caption is referencing the ad he’s featuring in, in which a ball gets kicked to him and he gets asked to ‘switch it’. It’s a reference to his passing ability and not his contract situation lol If you honestly believe that then I’ve got a bridge to sell you"

5778,Liverpool,"A lot of things are simultaneously true here

Salah absolutely needs to be renewed

Salah is going to be 33 when his new contract starts. 

We have Afcon in Dec next year and then world cup in 2026

Historically he has been poor after these tournaments

We really need a replacement on right wing and surely need to plan succession for a 35 year old player

We are never going to get a 40 goal replacement 

Club has survived with players leaving The absolute key is finding his successor, whether or not Salah renews. No, they aren't going to be as good as him (who is?), but the people spamming ""he's irreplaceable"" over and over are completely missing the point. 

He HAS to be replaced eventually, there's no two ways about it. We can kick the can down the hall for another season or two, but it needs to be addressed. How can you include World Cup when the last one he played in he wasn’t even fit because of Ramos ripping his shoulder off. 
But AFCON absolutely holds true. > We really need a replacement on right wing and surely need to plan succession for a 35 year old player


Part of that succession planning is having other options in the squad before he leaves who can step up. Salah aside, we've already completely rebuilt our attack the last few years by replacing Mane, Firmino, Original, Big Shaq, ect with younger players.


We got a sneaky peak of what being without Salah last season when he was injured/at AFCON mid season. We played 6 league games without him, won 5/6 (lost to Arsenal) and scored 17 goals. He was also missing for the league cup final we won, the league cup semis and Arsenal in the FA Cup - three wins, a draw, 6 goals. We mainly rotated Gakpo, Jota and Elliott on the right wing in those games. the club may be betting on ben doak, altho im sure they'll sign a replacement too Good post You forgot that after the last signing extension, his performance wasn't great. At least from what I remembered. If I'm FSG my words to Mo are ""here's a 3 years contract with option for an additional 1 year. But you're retiring from international football"""
5779,Liverpool,"The full comments from Mel Reddy (emphasis is mine):

>""You can understand why Salah has termed it this way. He doesn't have a new offer on the table, it's nearly December and he can speak to overseas clubs in January, which is just a blink away.

>**""It's important to stress negotiations are ongoing between Liverpool and Salah's representative, Remy Abbas. I'm told those are open, developing conversations. But ultimately, a formal proposal is only made when you've agreed on all the terms you are discussing.**

>**""Things are progressing in the right direction, but obviously there is a gap between what Salah wants and what Liverpool are prepared to put on the table. There has to be a compromise on both sides.**

>""Liverpool have to think about long-term squad planning, the age profile of the team, and about operating sustainably. But they would need to bend their parameters for Salah.

>""He still wants to compete for domestic titles, and the Champions League. If he's looking around, which top club would have space for him, and the ability to pay him what he deserves, and give him the freedom he wants?

>**""He has made it abundantly clear he loves Liverpool and wants to stay. So there also needs to be a bit of compromise on his side, and because there is a will to get a deal done from both parties, it will ultimately get there.**

>""There is an element of Liverpool being conscious that whatever concessions they make with Salah, they also have two other big contract issues to sort with Virgil Van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold, so there might be a bit of a knock-on effect there.

>""I'm told the club are very calm, but you can understand why the players, especially with the status of Salah, aren't feeling that way."" Last 3 parts are important. If they concede to salahs demands they concede to VVD and TAA who are probably waiting for Salah to set the bar. 

The only thing I dislike is that salahs comments could have a potential knock on effect of unsettling the players when they need to play a cup final every week for the next month. > ""It's important to stress negotiations are ongoing between Liverpool and Salah's representative, Remy Abbas. I'm told those are open, developing conversations. **But ultimately, a formal proposal is only made when you've agreed on all the terms you are discussing.**

exactly. muppets in the other thread had it in their heads that ""no formal offer"" meant we had not even talked to Salah about renewing

you make the formal contract offer once both sides have reached an agreement (or very close to it)"
5780,Liverpool,"It’s astonishing to me that people aren’t picking up that this is negotiation and show? 

ABBAs literally did a case study for Harvard business school on the last negotiation in which there were a few media appearances like this (the Spanish newspaper interview anyone?). 

The club imo should compromise a bit more than Mo, given it would cost 70m to sign someone like say, guyokeres + 200k per year in wages when you could just keep Mo for 2-3 hears at 20m per season The argument is that you are going to have to spend that 70m or so in 2-3 years Any Ways. Reneweing salah is a temporary long term solution, at best.

Hypothetically lets say the club has 100m to work on salah's replacement, lets say you extend salah on 350k a week for 2 years and he decides to retire aftet that. That is a 36.4m investment, which leaves you aboit 64m to look for a replacement in 2 years.

The alternative might be if you can identify a 100m player NOW who can hit the ground running like haaland did. 

So the value comparison is salah for 2 seasons + a 60m player in 2 years, or a 100m player Now. If you had salah for two seasons, followed by, say, a signing of someone like kai havertz(who was about 65m) in 2 seasons, versus signing someone like a haaland now, i think thats not that simple a decision to make.
 Im not saying that it is the right ot wrong choice but you can certainly see that there is at least a case Ok, but at the end of three years, you still have the new player to play or sell. Salah will decline physically over the next couple of years and then retire."
5781,Liverpool,"Anyone else following the Addidas sponsorship deal and thinking that the club are delaying decisions until they get sign the deal with Addidas so they have a projection of potential sponsorship revenue. To me, Salah’s marketing power is a vital asset. I mean the guy is not just a football player- he is a global brand ambassador and his marketability extends beyond the football pitch. Surely it would make a lot more sense for them to delay agreeing new sponsorship deals until they've worked out the contract situations, rather than the other way round?

Your position in negotiations with sponsors is SO much stronger if you've just got Salah, Virg, and Trent signed up to new deals. A bit like how the UFC aren't allowing Conor McGregor to fight until they've negotiated a new broadcasting deal because having him with 2 fights left on his contract significantly increases their bargaining power.

Negotiating a new sponsorship deal while your 3 highest profile players are potentially about to leave the club, and then deciding whether or not you can afford to renew their contracts based on the size of the deal you were able to get, would be kind of a counterproductive way to go about it in my opinion."
5782,Liverpool,Sounds very much like the club are briefing the press today. 
5783,Liverpool,"We can replace Salah while he’s still here. We just can’t do it in the form of a right winger who scores lots of goals. 

You can bring in another right winger, if they produce half the amount of goals, that’s still a top class right winger. What we need to do is to start upping our goals from other positions. Our main problem right now is we aren’t scoring enough from our striker position and no.10 that If we take Salah out the equation, we don’t have enough goals in the side to get 85+ points in a season. 

If we can solve that problem while Salah is still here, then getting his replacement becomes far, far easier. You can have a Doak-like winger who isn’t all about goals if you have a striker who can score close to 20 league goals and a no.10 scoring 10-12. Nunez isn’t contributing enough for a central striker. He is an opportunity cost and should be replaced with more lethal options like Isak as an example ."

5785,Liverpool,"I like it when calm people, calm people with smart words "
5786,Liverpool,Even if he does leave it doesnt necessarily mean our next talisman has to come from the right wing. Sure that position will need to be filled but the next big star can come from another position. 
5787,Liverpool,"[deleted] > “We’re saving to sign Mbappe”

This was never claimed by anyone connected to the club, it was stupid twitter thing that the press started to push as something real.

>“Salah needs to compromise and we’ll sign him”

Which is exactly what happened the last time round, and they did sign him. Of course there has to be a compromise as there is in every single negotiation ever…


No one in their right mind ever thought that Mbappe would come here. He was Madrid’s all along

We wanted Bellingham and were ready to pay for him. He chose Madrid… when are you guys gonna get that?



I am not trying apologize forFSG for taking so long with Salah but the others points are ridiculous. You are acting like we weren’t ready to pay for Bellingham, Caicedo, Zubemendi or even Touchemi. Sometimes you gotta get off this FSG are cheap talk and just accept players don’t want to come here."

Just pay the man. "
5798,Liverpool,"Blah blah blah - all I hear is them hiding and spinning things through journalists. Literally just noise.

My biggest fear is this becomes a genuine distraction. > spinning things through journalists.

It is important to note that unless we replace him internally we will need to wait until he leaves to replace him. No world class right wing that is a realistic replacement will be willing to sit on the bench and wait for him to retire. Just like Klopp. Couldn't imagine anyone filling those shoes, and though it's a small sample size Slot has been the perfect piece. It'll be the same with Salah when that time comes, just hopefully not for another few years. Ben doak will be like a new signing and harvey elliot when they come back /s

But yeah, FSG really need to the proverbial finger out and get him another couple years asap. Criminal if they run it down. You don't think Chiesa and Eliott are the replacement plans right now? Yup and this is why I was not impressed with us getting chiesa

exactly. muppets in the other thread had it in their heads that ""no formal offer"" meant we had not even talked to Salah about renewing

you make the formal contract offer once both sides have reached an agreement (or very close to it) I actually think that salah and his agent coming out and saying this has backfired on him a bit. Some of the narrative in the reporting is rightfully pointing out that salah is misrepresenting when he says they haven’t offered him a proposal. It's the same shtick every transfer window ""WHY DIDN'T WE PUT IN A BID IF WE WANT HIM SO MUCH?!?!?!"" Career mode has ruined them lmao"
5811,Liverpool,"The argument is that you are going to have to spend that 70m or so in 2-3 years Any Ways. Reneweing salah is a temporary long term solution, at best.

Hypothetically lets say the club has 100m to work on salah's replacement, lets say you extend salah on 350k a week for 2 years and he decides to retire aftet that. That is a 36.4m investment, which leaves you aboit 64m to look for a replacement in 2 years.

The alternative might be if you can identify a 100m player NOW who can hit the ground running like haaland did. 

So the value comparison is salah for 2 seasons + a 60m player in 2 years, or a 100m player Now. If you had salah for two seasons, followed by, say, a signing of someone like kai havertz(who was about 65m) in 2 seasons, versus signing someone like a haaland now, i think thats not that simple a decision to make.
 Im not saying that it is the right ot wrong choice but you can certainly see that there is at least a case Your maths is all wrong mate, you're not factoring in the wages of the signed player. Any worthwhile replacement who is £100mil is going to ask for at least £200k which is £20mil, you're then looking at £15mil difference for a player you know is playing at a high level and settled at the club. Haalands wage is reported at more than £375k so wouldn't be surprised if a £100mil player asked for Salahs wage either. So your logic is all wrong.

Plus transfer budgets work seasonally, so after 2 years there will likely be a bit more on the table.

The only reason renewing Salah doesn't make financial sense is because of his age, no-one knows if he will sustain it. In every other situation it makes sense to renew him. I mean if you gave him 3 years and sold him to Saudi in 2 you'd probably get £30mil for him from them But if Salah helps the team win more big titles in that time, that lead to more revenue coming in, then it’s a better deal that gambling £100m on a player that may or not be as good and could result in not winning those titles in that time. question is, do you have a player on the radar you can get right now, or is salah the best player you can have? in his position, i don't know of a player at the 100m price point that comes close to what he offers. This is not how you value an investment, not even remotely.

If you consider player and investment, you need to discount future cash flows to present value. Meaning, 64 mil in future has a lot of less value now and Salah’s contract + 64 mil in future is a lot of less than 100M now + discounted values of incoming players salary.

Then you account for marketing and income value as will incoming player be able to generate income stream like Salah does? This is done on multiple levels. If he’s shit, that is certain no. If he’s quality, how much is he popular? Is he regional, continental star? How much jerseys does he sell? You don’t know anything so you assume and attribute possibility values. 

With Salah, his income value is 1 and his cost value is 1 as it is certain. With incoming guy the only certain thing is his cost at value of 1."
5812,Liverpool,"Ok, but at the end of three years, you still have the new player to play or sell. Salah will decline physically over the next couple of years and then retire. "
5813,Liverpool,"Surely it would make a lot more sense for them to delay agreeing new sponsorship deals until they've worked out the contract situations, rather than the other way round?

Your position in negotiations with sponsors is SO much stronger if you've just got Salah, Virg, and Trent signed up to new deals. A bit like how the UFC aren't allowing Conor McGregor to fight until they've negotiated a new broadcasting deal because having him with 2 fights left on his contract significantly increases their bargaining power.

Negotiating a new sponsorship deal while your 3 highest profile players are potentially about to leave the club, and then deciding whether or not you can afford to renew their contracts based on the size of the deal you were able to get, would be kind of a counterproductive way to go about it in my opinion. Makes sense although financially without the sponsorship deal in place the club will be hesitant to risk overextending their wage budget."
5814,Liverpool,Nunez isn’t contributing enough for a central striker. He is an opportunity cost and should be replaced with more lethal options like Isak as an example . Yeah I like the lad but it's his third season now he really needs to either shit or get off the pot
5815,Liverpool,"> “We’re saving to sign Mbappe”

This was never claimed by anyone connected to the club, it was stupid twitter thing that the press started to push as something real.

>“Salah needs to compromise and we’ll sign him”

Which is exactly what happened the last time round, and they did sign him. "
5816,Liverpool,"Of course there has to be a compromise as there is in every single negotiation ever…


No one in their right mind ever thought that Mbappe would come here. He was Madrid’s all along

We wanted Bellingham and were ready to pay for him. He chose Madrid… when are you guys gonna get that?



I am not trying apologize forFSG for taking so long with Salah but the others points are ridiculous. You are acting like we weren’t ready to pay for Bellingham, Caicedo, Zubemendi or even Touchemi. Sometimes you gotta get off this FSG are cheap talk and just accept players don’t want to come here. "
5817,Liverpool,"We said that 2 years ago when saudi were snooping Saudi were snooping 1 year ago. Well, the summer transfer window of 2023."
5818,Liverpool,"> spinning things through journalists. 

And Salah isn't by stopping to talk to journalists for the first time in five years? He is saying it loud and clear. Out more than in, i am disappointed. That is complaining and not spinning.

Now,  Edwards comes out and says that then it would not be spin and would be an actual answer."
5819,Liverpool,"do you honestly believe that the club are not in negotiations with Salah's representatives? Salah cannot flat out lie to the public and create drama. Thats not the type of person he is. If there were negotiations, He would have said no comment. But For him to say, “No offers have been made” he is clearly signaling the truth.And is frustrated as to why and wants the fans to engage with ownership."
5820,Liverpool,"afcon is next season.

it runs from December 18th to mid January, the busiest part of the season "
5821,Liverpool,"It is important to note that unless we replace him internally we will need to wait until he leaves to replace him. No world class right wing that is a realistic replacement will be willing to sit on the bench and wait for him to retire. Very much agree on this point. Certain times you can have successors rise through the ranks as a star ages, Quansah could be an example of that. 


But given Mo's absurd attacking output it feels we'll need to recruit externally and grab a prime age player that can soften the blow  The closest thing we currently have is Stoke's own Gareth Bale - Koumas. That's why you replace his output in one of the other forward position. If you've ever seen the ""he gets on base"" scene from Moneyball, we're essentially in that position renewal or not. All a renewal does is decide the immediacy of the decision making. I could also see Slot getting creative with roles and structure to accommodate Mo and other needs.

It may be that Mo moves to a more inside role sometimes as he slows down and a “replacement” comes in to absorb his minutes as that happens, plus perhaps get minutes elsewhere. > No world class right wing that is a realistic replacement will be willing to sit on the bench and wait for him to retire.

You see, the ""issue"" is - when we bought Salah in 2017 no one thought we're buying what he turned out to be. Yeah but which player can actually replace Salah?? I really don't see someone that can be so consistent as he... The team in general needs another World class forward. It doesn't need to be RW bet certainly someone on that level... I mean, you can acquire rising talent and they can endure a short wait but obviously the more established a player is the truer your comment rings and everyone is always fighting over the young potential world beaters anyway we do play a lot of games though, and his performance is somewhat dictated by workload. a bakayoko level player could fit into the rotation while providing a long term prospect to replace mo for me."
5822,Liverpool,"Just like Klopp. Couldn't imagine anyone filling those shoes, and though it's a small sample size Slot has been the perfect piece. It'll be the same with Salah when that time comes, just hopefully not for another few years. Dude calm down... This is basically Klopps team so far... The Slot's team will be from next year... No matter how much you sugarcoat it that is Slots effect this is Klopps team. Even though Slot has changed the formation and some a bit of the tactical approach, it mostly relies on how the team wroked under Klopp...

I am not saying that Slot isn't good or won't be good but has a lot of work do. For example we have huge problems between the lines in the midfield. ( This isn't the player's fault but a problem in tactical approach). We were very lucky against Chelsea... RM will take full advantage of that. Same as City..."
5823,Liverpool,"Ben doak will be like a new signing and harvey elliot when they come back /s

But yeah, FSG really need to the proverbial finger out and get him another couple years asap. Criminal if they run it down. Luis Diaz is better than both of those, even playing on the right.

Both Nunez and Gakpo can then play on the left."
5824,Liverpool,"You don't think Chiesa and Eliott are the replacement plans right now? I think Chiesa is the interim successor. Could become the more longer successor depending on how things work out with him.

Eliott i think isn't fast enough to be a wing or at least to be considered to be our long term successor in that role and imo is going to be competing with Dom for that midfield spot  throughout his time here I don’t really understand how anyone can think Elliott is good enough to be a Salah replacement. He’s a great squad player, but he isn’t a starting forward for us, and I’ll be surprised if he ever is. For Salah? I don't, no. Chiesa is a great squad player across that front line, but Elliott is too slow to be a winger, he will be played at the 10 Of course not, they’re completely different players and will probably have 25% of the G/A slash will Elliot is not a forward and/or winger. ""Chiesa"" lol no."
5825,Liverpool,"Yup and this is why I was not impressed with us getting chiesa

His injury really made him a liability and bringing him here seemed like a dumb decision. May be I'll be proven wrong It takes players a while to recover from those knee injuries. I’d not write him off after a couple of months and no pre-season. Chiesa was never going to be a replacement for Mo, he is an add on. Salah can’t be replaced, even when he retires. He is arguably top 5 in a group including Messi and Ronaldo 1,2. Meh it was very obviously a last ditch signing and we were able to get him for far cheaper than I would’ve expected to the point that the sell on clause on Solanke joining Spurs pretty much covered his transfer fee, I don’t think he was intended to be THE replacement at RW"
5826,Liverpool,I meant to say international tournament in which Egypt might qualify which right now they are flying 
5827,Liverpool,"Yeah, we can still win without Salah, but I reckon it would fatigue the team eventually. Other players have to put much more effort in to replace his contributions. "
5828,Liverpool,30 goals in 51 the season after he signed not enough for you? 
5829,Liverpool,"LMAO I don't think anyone should sign that

Fsg don't own him. I do think it should be a 2+1 contract "
5830,Liverpool,"Which isn’t fair demand. You can’t ask Mo to give up representing Egypt when representing their country is a prestige for every player. Screw fair, he always comes back broken after being run into the ground by the manager and then their dickhead fans unload in him 

Liverpool needs>>>>>>>>daylight>>>>>>>>Egyptian needs"
5831,Liverpool,"Eh I think VVD>Salah>Trent. Virg will make less than both and is the most obvious renewal. He'll be first, which will then reduce Salah's leverage, and then when he comes to terms they'll throw the bag at Trent (or not). "
5832,Liverpool,"I this Salah has been very selfish tbh. If he leaves he leaves, wish he'd do his talking on the pitch and stop mentioning the contract negotiations every month. "

Also we don't really have a replacement ready to go. Also he clearly wants to stay. I didnt factor in the salary of Both new players, so i think they will probably come out about the same in the long run.

Just cos a player has a big fee doesnt necessarily mean high wages, see nunez and diaz. Haaland wpuld never be earning that salary if he came to us fresh.

'seasonal' transfer budgeting is how you run into trouble. Viewed as a totality the club just wants the best outcome for the dollar. Besides, in two seasons, there are likely to be more players needing to be replaced.

Lets say we renew salah and VvD, in two seasons both of them will need to be replaced. Robbo will be 32 in two seasons and may need replacing. Endo will also likely be gone. Trying to replace both VvD AND salah, and maybe robertson, in the same window, is a very high stakes game where alot can go wrong.

Look im not against renewing salah. But from the clubs perspective i can see why there are difficult things to consider. I would point to on pitch performance, which admittedly fsg don't care as much about. For one, we have never been a club to buy a 100m star in his prime, so irrespective of when salah leaves, we are not getting a haaland, or jude or mbappe or vini level guy in his place. Which means the 50-60m player we sign is not gonna replicate Salah's output. So we need to be able to distribute that output into other areas. The left is good, with lucho and gakpo rotating nicely, maybe will get to peak Mane levels soon. But the striker position with Jota and Darwin is not strong enough right now. Neither do we have AMs like Coutinho or KdB or Wirtz or Musiala who can create a new channel of goal threat. So losing salah now creates a void that we cannot fill.


In another 2yrs, we get time to see if doak can become a player for us. His development will define what level of player we exactly need at RW. It also allows us to buy the 60m player one year earlier, and allow him to rotate with salah, for his bedding in period, instead of having to play and perform week in week out right after coming in. It gives us time to think about and upgrade our striker position, either Slot makes Darwin a 20-goal striker or we buy one. And finally, another 2yrs with salah's performance levels gives us the best chance to win more titles.


Now the question you may still ask from all of this is how do you know salah will continue to perform like this for the next 2. I don't.. none of us do. So we make inferences based on what we know about salah..none of which points towards a decline in the immediate future. However, Afcon 2026 could mean he loses his sharpness for the last couple of months of next season. Followed by the world cup. So the ideal plan here would be to use Doak as a proper rotation to salah in those months. Then based on how he has performed, we buy a RW in the summer of 2026, with the world cup going on. Then Salah (maybe gassed after the world cup), the new guy and Doak can compete for the RW spot, the latter two learning from salah in the process. And finally 2027, we can bid salah a farewell, and either of those two can make that position their own. "
5868,Liverpool,"From a sporting perspective i agree, but you will be surprised that the actual earnings difference for winning and top 4 is not very big.

For example, the difference between first and second in winnings in the epl is less than 10m. This can't be factoring in sponsorship offers for winning the big prizes. it makes a differance in the long run, see united"
5869,Liverpool,"Thats the million dollar question for edwards and hughes to answer. 

The other issue is that assuming we renew both salah and virg for two seasons, then we are eventually going to have to replace both of them in the same window. That is.... A very, very high stakes transfer window to get right, perhaps the club wantd to spread the pain around. depends how they both age, but it's a fair point. having said that, it's potentially the reality this summer, plus trent, with zero recovered in fees, so i feel like they're fucked either way. They should definitely spread it around, but not having to replace them this summer, means we can account for a couple of other positions now, then a couple in 2025-26, and not have a similar situation with 3 stars in their final years in 2027.


Summer of 25: Sign midfielder for the double pivot to provide backup and compete with Macca, Grav and Jones. Sign RB, assuming Trent leaves on a free. Renew Konate (expires in 26). Decide on the GK situation, what to do with Kelleher (expires in 26)


Summer of 26: Sign starting LB, with Robbo leaving. Sign RW to compete with Salah and based on how Doak has developed. Sign ST, make the call based on Darwin's level, and Jota's fitness (with the latter's contract expiring in 27). Renewals for Jones, Elliott and Bradley (all expiring in 27). Decision on Lucho, expiring in 27 with him touching 30


Summer of 27: Sign CB, based on how Quansah has developed. Renew Macca, Grav, Dom and Gakpo (all expiring in 28). Salah leaves, but we have the people to replace him. Endo leaves, again no replacement needed. Decide on Tsimi and Gomez, both expiring and past the 30 mark."

5875,Liverpool,"Considering the output I’d rather bring in a striker to lessen the output blow and bring in someone that can learn massively from Salah for a season, someone like Dibling.

The other thing I can see happening is bringing in a new CAM and freeing Szobo up by playing him on the right. > Considering the output I’d rather bring in a striker to lessen the output blow


Club has 2 starting quality CFs (Jota and Nunez) with Gakpo able to play there as well. They aren't going to add a 3rd starting quality CF and only add a backup RW."
5876,Liverpool,"Yep, all of this. If you're replacing Salah, you do it with, for example, a Gyokores, and buy a more creative winger. No other wide player around is going to replace his goals. Yeah, realistically, you're going to be spreading his goals and assists around 2 or more players"
5877,Liverpool,"I could see it, but realistically that means a 9 and we are selling Nunez to make room. I suppose I would be fine with that if we got a world class 9. "
5878,Man City,"Gundo is starting to play like his old self again. We needed this and he's stepping up. Not gonna lie I thought he was poor in the first half today, getting dispossessed too easily too often. But he's looked good start of the second half"
5879,Man City,End-of-the-season Gundoğan loading 
5880,Man City,hope this goal gives him confidence... we could use the leadership 
5881,Man City,Cmon McAtee 
5882,Man City,https://preview.redd.it/10zzhzh8bb3e1.jpeg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebee74af89ba5dfdb0fe6f9229e2a7d59375494e 
5883,Man City,We need to see Gundo on the scoresheet more often 
5884,Man City,"Not gonna lie I thought he was poor in the first half today, getting dispossessed too easily too often. But he's looked good start of the second half "
5885,Man City,"Naughty step for the next person to post a whole thread instead of commenting in here. Sounds kinky “EDERSON”

That’s it. That’s the post title."
5886,Man City,This would be around the time I delete my save and start a new game. I would delete the game and look at nothing for 15 minutes
5887,Man City,"As soon as it was 3-1, pep knew. Tbh, I also knew. wtf is going on man I honestly thought it would be 3-4 Pep is partially to blame. The system simply needs to change to give the defense more cover. Drop the defensive line lower idk. We continue to try the same thing and wonder why we are shipping fuck loads of goals."
5888,Man City,"I want everyone in this thread to know: this is exactly how it felt to be a city fan pre-2008. It wasn't just that we were shit, we were incredibly inconsistent, capable of both great and downright abysmal football all in the same match. It was hell and don't let anyone ever tell you different That was remarkably similar from the match that got Hughes sacked if I recall. only difference is that now we actually have the expectation to win every single match, so the disappointment is arguably worse Turning up every week with hope, mainly to be let down but it didn’t matter cos “there’s always next week”. It was fucking magnificent haha When were we great in this match though. We got a questionable penalty then for about 10 minutes the opposition defence was shit. We didnt play well at all."
5889,Man City,Why didn't we let Ederson walk? :( His head has been in Saudi all season Cause we have a weird fanbase with this weird obsession where GKs are better off passing out the back than shot-stopping As if he hasn’t been good this sesson. Give your head a wobble
5890,Man City,"No tactical changes are fixing this team! Enough with the calls for Pep to ‘put on X’. The whole squad are lacking in confidence. I wouldn’t be so generous to say they’re just lacking confidence. They’re complacent and careless. You don’t do what we’ve done recently if everyone cares and wants to win. It just doesn’t happen. 

They had their chance to step up and show it was just a blip. They’ve shown they’re for the most part redundant to us if we want to win stuff. Tactics aren’t even to blame for tonight. Two players decided to just nuke the game and there was nothing anyone could do to stop it."
5891,Man City,"No one beats us 6 in a row, we showed them. "
5892,Man City,"I've been following City since the 90s. Games like these remind me of the good old days Back to typical city! Typical City, eh? Been a couple years...this feels eerily comforting"
5893,Man City,So this is what being in a banter era feels like Banter era is this feeling but for ten years 😂 This isn't close to being our banter era. We were in league 1 at one point...
5894,Man City,the disappointment i saw in haaland's and nunes' eyes oof I’d honestly be livid if I were them They are trying so hard every game and they’re being betrayed.
5895,Man City,Pep looked like crying at the end I would too lol. It’s all on the players [deleted]
5896,Man City,I expected nothing and I was still disappointed That felt like a dream that you slowly started to feel uncomfortable in and then you woke up to find you’d had diarrhoea in your sleep Hope that kills you
5897,Man City,Mentality is entirely gone. Literally never does that happen in previous seasons. It won't be forever but fucking hell it's come at a bad time. 
5898,Man City,"I mean, we broke our losing streak, so... yay? It’s not a L, got points at least!

But seriously wtf … blowing a 3 goal lead in 15 minutes at fucking home lol Job done ✓"
5899,Man City,We're Man United now Not even. They are shit but get bailed out by individual talent. We are shit and the individuals are utter wank save for literally Haaland and Nunes. We might even be worse than them in our current form. The situation has never looked this dire. We might be going through the biggest downfall in the history of football.
5900,Man City,No optimism. That was fucking inexcusable and pathetic. 
5901,Man City,"Lmao that was crazy. Feynoord didn't even look like they gave a shit when we were 3-0 up, then we decided to gift them three goals. Insanity. "
5902,Man City,"We’re probably in Instagram apologies from players territory. At this point, I need ex players to drop apologies for leaving. Need one from Palmer, Alvarez, Gomez..."
5903,Man City,"Speechless. We bottled a 3-0 lead. I’m actually stunned. And it was…. so easy. Like, they didn’t even play that well in that timeframe and they just scored 3 goals. In the space of 15 minutes. I never want to hear ""why doesn't pep play mcatee"" again. and what the fuck was he thinking throwing simpson-pursey in that game with so many time left? we invited them to hurt us."
5904,Man City,"I'll say it again:

Lineup for anfield

GK Carson, CB Phillips, CB Fernandinho, LB Bernardo, RB Rodri's Ballon D'or trophy, CDM Rodri's working knee, CM Ederson, CM Isco, LW Oscar Bobb on crutches, ST David James, RW the Ferran Torres money Barca owes us. "
5905,Man City,I wanna see 200m in January 
5906,Man City,"they'll put the ticket prices up again tho they will have to, the revenues will go down after this season 🤣"
5907,Man City,"bringing on the youngsters like we're 5-0 up at home against burnley It was 3-0 at home against Feyenoord. It's not so significantly different. Had he made no subs being 3-0 up and with no other players to start on the next game, what would you comment then? ""Should have played the youngsters/should have rested the senior available players"""
5908,Man City,"Now we are 100% losing at Anfield. Mate we’d be top of the table and I’d still bet on us to lose at Anfield Now?  lol. As if we weren't before. Pray it's not more than 4:0 losing would not be that bad, it is anfield, i think we can reapet united 0-7"
5909,Man City,"This is the old city, we are so back "
5910,Man City,Call out bernardo please? Useless af. What's the point of dribbling if you can't create any separation cause of your below negative athletic abilities At this point every single player needs to be called out. Everyone is doing something wrong lol
5911,Man City,Our confidence just dropped after that 1st goal. I don't think it's a good idea to field really young players when we need to be at full strength Was Gvardiol who buggered it Young players made no mistake that the opposition capitalized on
5912,Man City,On the plus side Erling and Matheus were great 
5913,Man City,"Ederson couldn’t save a word document, much less a shot on goal right now. "
5914,Man City,"I'm not really sure if there's much to say. This might not be a down year but a diabolical one. I think we're literally on life support until January I guess? 

We just get really tired after 60-ish minutes and you can walk through us, we make mistakes etc etc. Hardly anyone can stay fit, the ones that can have to play 90 minutes twice a week every week. 

I don't know if it would've been worse if we just got battered or going up by 3 then capitulating like that. I mean I guess we didn't lose so we broke the streak lmao. 

But I think we're aiming for top 4 this year, not the title. We just have to limit the damage as much as we can, you can see the frustration, you can see the exhaustion. After the 4-peat, after the treble, we've just collapsed on the pitch we're so tired lol. 

Not looking forwards to Liverpool I think we're about to get ripped apart. I think we just have to start playing academy kids for fresh legs. Arguably we should've started the likes of Simpson, McAtee, O'Reilly tonight with our energy levels being so bad, but I suppose we still needed to try and get as many UCL points as possible. I don't think any player bar probably Nunes is fit enough to play twice a week atm so just play the kids in any cup games for December etc. 

Makes you appreciate the good times lmao. I think we will get back there again but wow this is literally the worst period we've had in...over a decade and in Peps entire career. At lease now we get to see the end of this squad. This season is literally like pep 1st season and the season we lose to Liverpool for the title. When player all out injured, even when they come back, the match sharpness was out. And the player on the field, all are in bad form. Actually before the match, I dont even think that we would score 3. And I also thought that we will drew. And this game, after the 1st goal come in, the game totally smell tie. I don't know why but the feeling is somewhat similar to those ""typical city moment"" during the game."
5915,Man City,"Johan Cruyff if you can hear me please save us, please Johan Cruyff save us please I'm asking

https://preview.redd.it/e6hc1u84lb3e1.png?width=452&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3eceed0d8f4e618e33b3d40f85efcebd6d0f7ddb "
5916,Man City,4 assist for Gvardiol in the last 2 games lol He’s taken all his defense ability and transferred it to his attacking
5917,Man City,Hilarious 
5918,Man City,I had 0 expectations and am still disappointed lol 
5919,Man City,All I want for Christmas is Ruben Dias and John Stones. 
5920,Man City,holy fuck we suck 
5921,Man City,Please don’t tell me we are going back to the “typical city” banter era Feels like the 2000s again
5922,Man City,Was expecting us to concede another goal before full-time tbh 
5923,Man City,You have to just laugh at this point. Thankfully there are much more important things in life than football. 
5924,Man City,Lmao Gvardiol and Ederson were truly terrible. Honestly like 50% of the squad needs to leave and be replaced. 
5925,Man City,"As much as this is on the players, bringing on McAtee and Pussey was tragic. "
5926,Man City,Is this bottom?  It has to be bottom. Bro liverpool at anfield is next
5927,Man City,We just fucking suck rn and we’re going to have to ride this shit out until we can refresh the squad. Putting the outcome of your season on ONE PLAYER (Rodri) is idiotic and Txiki and Pep are both at fault for that. 
5928,Man City,Bantzchester City 
5929,Man City,the only good thing about Grealish returning is that we got to see Nunes in the midfield adding some physicality Will grealish ever beat his man is the question?
5930,Man City,"Shout out to Nunes though. He really tried to be a leader there and pull us out of this slump. Agreed, Golden Retriever energy."
5931,Man City,"Self-inflicted, collective collapse. We gave up three goals from nothing.

Liverpool were watching this and licking their lips to play us at Anfield. "
5932,Man City,"Team are truly lacking in confidence and on the pitch leadership at the moment. 

Going to have to get the Liverpool game out of the way first, and then a nice tough trip to bogey team palace…

But hey, typical city :) still supporting through thick and thin.  "
5933,Man City,We are not just cooked we are caramelised for anfield leg 
5934,Man City,"Can we skip this season. This is too much Eddie, Ortega IN "
5935,Man City,Well the kids won’t see the pitch anytime soon Saddddddd hahaaha
5936,Man City,Guess I'm captaining Salah in fpl 
5937,Man City,"Feels like a loss this one, absolutely unbelievable how we can go from being in control to that. To just implode like that in defence is unreal. 7 goals in two games at home is simply unacceptable, and I fear we’ll probably concede another 7 on Sunday with the way we’re going "
5938,Man City,"The defence totally crumbled, but I just don’t understand why we played the end of the game in desperation like we needed to score. "
5939,Man City,Rodri is THAT critical This is not just Rodri. We missed him last season as well for a few games and were not this shit. This is the result of not properly strengthening the squad and keeping around players that should’ve retired or been shipped off to Saudi. And missing Dias on top of that.
5940,Man City,Lol 
5941,Man City,I’m empty inside. Wanna be filled up?
5942,Man City,"I take blame. They started scoring when I turned on the stream. Same 😭 Booo no i take the blame, i started calling haaland the real mr champions league"
5943,Man City,Oscar Bobb will be back soon and it will all be better I’ll tell myself how is bobb gonna help us defend lmfaooo Can he play RB?
5944,Man City,Figured out the scoring now the defense is all that’s left 
5945,Man City,"I’d rather have a decent shot stopper in goal than a keeper who is great at playing with their feet Agree, its easy to be called a top 5 gk in the world when your team consistently averages like 90% posession. Now with shots falling on him, he is looking bang average unfortunately"
5946,Man City,"If this not a wake up call then I don't know what is.

  
How can you break a losing streak and yet it still feels like a loss man It’s been a wake up call for a month. They’re deaf apparently"
5947,Man City,"Gvardiol has be benched for couple of games. Let him sort his shit out. Ederson feels off as well.   
And idk whats going on with midfield cz it looks non existent. Who is going to sub in for him? We have no one"
5948,Man City,Dogshit season 
5949,Man City,"I feel very bad for Nunes, had an amazing showing today. Awful 2nd half from the defence, Gvardiol especially. He’s really the only bright spot lately"
5950,Man City,"Definitely time for a squad refresh. Until then only one thing to do.

https://preview.redd.it/eh3j2dsalb3e1.jpeg?width=1070&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3129b71625a3db484edb68c33d29ac234995f9c "
5951,Man City,Can we just not field a team vs Liverpool and take the automatic 3-0 loss and the fine? 
5952,Man City,Embarrassing defense. 
5953,Man City,Offense finally did their jobs but defense was still shit. Were gonna get battered at anfield 
5954,Man City,At this point I’m not even upset anymore cause we 100% deserve these results. Our defense DESERVES to concede constantly if we play like this. A draw was the most fair outcome today 
5955,Man City,Bernardo played 90 minutes and did nothing 
5956,Man City,Typical City is so back 
5957,Man City,Liverpool will score 10 in the first half past this useless defense 
5958,Man City,This clearly shows that our main problem is our defence. I think rodri has always made it seem better than it was now they are all being exposed 
5959,Man City,Our subs Fkn killed our shape 
5960,Man City,"1 point in the last 6 matches, with a 3-0 lead bottled… Just brutal"
5961,Man City,"Age has clearly kicked in, got to try and get to January with a few more results and bring some reinforcements in.

We aren't winning the title but got to begin the rebuild "
5962,Man City,Waiting for the winter window. 
5963,Man City,I'm sorry what the fuck happened there? I went out it was 3 - 0 and city were well on top. How did it end up 3 all. Embarrassing defending. Gvardiol needs dropping asap. Never wanna see him and Rico as fullbacks again.
5964,Man City,I hope the “De Bruyne must start” merchants will take a break now for at least a week. That brother is not playing 90 minutes anytime soon. I don’t even see him starting till after the forest game
5965,Man City,I may unload my entire 401k on a Liverpool win on Sunday 
5966,Man City,"Can we get Alvarez back on a loan please We scored 3 today. No team should be blowing a 3 goal lead, especially not a top side like City. We scored three goals today. What we need is Rordi."
5967,Man City,Everyone trashing gundogan at half time... Shoulda swapped out Bernardo instead this match. He looked lost 
5968,Man City,Play all the academy kids maybe they’ll actually give a shit 
5969,Man City,We never win at home and we never win away We lost last week and we lost today
5970,Man City,"Bro we are so cooked, we are driving closer and closer to rock bottom. "
5971,Man City,"Pro: we've scored

Cons: we bottled a 3-0 lead and Haaland was once again the only attacksr to score "
5972,Man City,First we treat the new fans to the bad old days of losing in the trot. Now we're introducing them to typical city. Great community initiative from the club 
5973,Man City,"I mean, it's not a loss, so we got better ig.... Feels like a fucking loss. Should’ve had that game wrapped up in the 1st half I'm more pissed about this than the loss at the weekend. Pathetic display"
5974,Man City,"This is the first one of our last games that I've actually been angry about. Oh well, let's go pump the scousers 7-0 at Anfield for the banter CTID "
5975,Man City,Whole thing is a mess. And doesn’t seem like there is a fix coming. Players seem burnt out 
5976,Man City,"When it rains in Manchester, it really pours doesn't it? Sheesh, that hurts. "
5977,Man City,Is this the worst 3 goal ever conceded? 
5978,Man City,"Dunno how much we can win this season, but we still have the best manager in the world and he'll fix this He wont though. There is miracles and there is a divine act of God."
5979,Man City,"These lot need some hardcore therapy, that was just a gutless performance in the 2nd half. How do you lose a three goal lead at home against Feyenoord? No matter any fatigue or injuries that’s just inexcusable "
5980,Man City,I don’t even wanna talk about it 
5981,Man City,We ain't winning shit with this defense. 
5982,Man City,How did Ederson even concede these goals man. What the fuck? Why is he rushing forward off balance like that? Even if he does nothing Feyenoord aren't scoring. Wasn't great hey
5983,Man City,We might just be cursed 
5984,Man City,That was funny ngl 
5985,Man City,"What a nothing burger of a post. 

Leaving it up this time because everyone’s come flooding in anyway, but come on. Grainy screengrabs of randos on Twitter are not allowed. "
5986,Man City,Needs to happen anyway…can’t run Rodri into the ground every season 
5987,Man City,"""confirmed""...

There's nothing to show we'll buy anyone. Exactly. Confirmed there's talks, but that's it. I think it means they will force sign someone to get the end of the reason right most likely someone proven in the big stages"
5988,Man City,https://preview.redd.it/03bmg74ox83e1.png?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=186fb833a8b41652dff5b7da3fdfe18c75ba1855 
5989,Man City,Kalvin Phillips redemption arc ? 
5990,Man City,"Realistically what are the options? I’d love to see Zubi but I just cannot see him leaving in January if at all with how loyal he’s been to his club. Kimmich would be great but we could get him in the summer on a free like someone else mentioned… Who else really is there that can slot in? There’s plenty of youngsters but we REALLY need someone in their mid twenties whose proven in my opinion… It’s Ricci, Ederson (Atalanta) or Zubimendi. 

Personally I want ederson the most. Seems to be a dogged midfielder who’s 6’1 and similar to Fernandinho. That sounds great to me. 

Barella is a dream, but I don’t think it happens, and frankly, I don’t like the idea of signing an Italian from a resurgent Italian giant. 

But we need another midfielder, we need a RB and we need a 2nd striker and a CB. Barella Ricci

Has a release clause too apparently Anybody know if Barca are willing to part with De Jong? He would be perfecto"
5991,Man City,"Inb4 it's a veteran player to go along with our veteran midfield, or a panic buy player like Nunes was We're bringing Toni Kross out of retirement It'll be fine to get a solid veteran in January as long as we properly goilninto the market in the summer. Everyone is gonna be overpriced in January so it won't be easy to get a good fit who's also young"
5992,Man City,Of this is eddys last seasons might be good tome to buy a keeper They will delay the replacement gk for a few seasons like what they do with rodri’s. Is this confirmed?
5993,Man City,how on earth is this confirmation 
5994,Man City,"Seems like it’s gonna be a panic purchase. I personally would love Kimmich but would rather wait for the summer when he’s a free agent, unless we can just dump 40€ million on him without worrying about whether he can last us two more seasons. All the elite holding midfielders are crucial to their respective teams since that position in today’s football is pretty proportional to teams’ success and consistency on the pitch. Barca has a few DMs that pass the eye test and they’re broke maybe they’d be open to selling us Casado? Kimmich is a very average DM in the Bundesliga, imagine how lost he’ll be in the PL. we should definitely not buy him. Kimmich would have been my dream last season. Now I don’t know. Have always loved him. I don't think Kimmich at his age would be able to play well in the PL... It’s ridiculous we’re YET AGAIN panic buying a mediocre midfielder. 

Kovacic. 
Nunes. 
Phillips. 

Complete failures in vision"
5995,Man City,"When joao neves was available for 60 million, no one at city batted any eyelid. Signing him is like getting rodri 2.0 for the next decade. It took a “crisis” to finally target a midfielder. 1) He's nothing like Rodri, he's like half the size.

2) He rejected us for PSG, cant rate him. The problem is to find a mid in his prime that's going to agree to sit on the bench and play whenever Rodri needs rest/ is injured.  He would’ve been a Bernardo 2.0, not Rodri’s."
5996,Man City,Not a X/Twitter user but what's this guy's credibility? He's just repeating what David Ornstein already said. MCFC Tone is KFC Tier aka shit
5997,Man City,I keep hearing Echeverri may be too small right now to play PL? Anyone know? I’m sure a year training with City and our trainers would get him right Echeverri is a project. He’s not saving our season. Echeverri is a project. He’s not saving our season.
5998,Man City,"I swear to god, the made up rumors in soccer are infinitely worse than the sports in America. Nothing here says anything man. What reports? What talks? What account even is this? Confirmed? Do you know what that word means? Saying soccer invalidates anything you said"
5999,Man City,Enzo Fernandes To Manchester City! Here We Go! 
6000,Man City,Finally ... 
6001,Man City,No backup striker? 🤣 
6002,Man City,Yes we need one rn 
6003,Man City,"we need pace at midfield, gundo and kova can't trackback fast enough when we got countered "
6004,Man City,McAtee can barely get minutes. Echeverri will get basically none no?? 
6005,Man City,Zubimendi from Sociedad. Pay him whatever it takes to get him to go. He’s Rodri 2.0. 
6006,Man City,"I don’t know why we’re not going for Ezequiel Palacios. He seems to be an afterthought at Leverkusen, even though every time he plays he dominates the match. "
6007,Man City,"Musiala or Wirtz, anyone else is just dumbitty dumb "
6008,Man City,TIER -50 source. 
6009,Man City,Zakaria hopefully

6034,Man City,"I’m from the US lol 🤷🏻‍♂️ next time I’ll call it football for yall! Yes please. And as for what u were saying, Tone is pretty reliable."

We are getting battered with this double pivot for the past 5 games. I’m just begging for Jacob Wright to get some minutes. Who knows what will happen? I know a double pivot with Gundo ain’t it though. Maybe Nunes instead of Bernardo as the second pivot?"
6038,Man City,Thought Kdb was gonna start Hopefully save him for Liverpool Yeah wtf is going on with him. Starting to think there’s more to it.
6039,Man City,Looks like Nunes is playing in midfield - he's quick so that's a positive 
6040,Man City,Is KDB ever going to start a game again? Needs some match fitness before Liverpool. Makes me think he’s still not medically 100%. Pain. He said he got pain free just last Friday so he’ll probably come on today and start the next ine
6041,Man City,"Come on City, show Feyenoord what English champions are made of! 💫

Time to paint the Champions League sky blue! 🔵👊 HAHAHA no Haha you're funny!"
6042,Man City,"Guys KdB said he wasn’t pain free until recently, so of course he isn’t starting this game "
6043,Man City,At least Nunes is starting Your favourite!
6044,Man City,"Grandpa Gundo is back in town ![gif](giphy|wVw0kx7bWgV4k8Q13s)

😭😭😭😭 Well at least Walker isn’t starting! That’s one good thing!"
6045,Man City,I sense a lot of negativity but I believe Nunes and Grealish will change completely the face of this team 
6046,Man City,"Thank god walker isnt playing.

He is incredible but has just been to far off it.

Super happy for Nunez and grealish though!

Lets goooo! "
6047,Man City,"Bernado, Lewis and Gundo again😭😭😭😭 "
6048,Man City,We are so weak in midfield. 
6049,Man City,Put KDB in Jesus. And inject rodri with every single stem cell available on earth Shove Javi Garcia up top whilst you’re at it And maybe drop to a 532 since we keep letting people score
6050,Man City,"Eddy 

Akanji Ake Gvardiol 

    Lewis Gundo
    Bernardo Nunes

Phil Haaland Grealish? Hope not, three at the back only works when the defensive mids fall back, Rico Lewis incapable of tracking back and Gundo hasn’t got the legs. I think we'll see Grealish drifting in behind the striker as a number ten with Nunes staying wide on the left. more like

6052,Man City,Please be Nunes in midfield. I cannot watch Gundogan running in treacle yet again. 
6053,Man City,"I’ve seen enough, Gareth Barry welcome back to Manchester "
6054,Man City,At least Walker is on the bench and Nunes is back. 
6055,Man City,This can not be happening. 3-3 now?? 🤬 
6056,Man City,Humbling 
6057,Man City,"This does not look good guys. What the hell is up with Kev, why isn’t he starting? It’s been almost a month since he’s been back on the bench Read somewhere that he did an interview saying that he has been having a recurring pain that’s been postponing his comeback to full fitness, but it seems to be a lot better now. (His words) We play Liverpool on Sunday, probably going to keep him fresh for that."
6058,Man City,"So will we be losing 0-2, or 0-4 today "
6059,Man City,I think Foden 10 with Gundo and Nunes will work beautifully. Let’s see. 
6060,Man City,"I understand everyone's concerns as I worry too. But it's not like Pep has infinite pool of players to choose from at the moment. He's not even picking the best lineup, he's picking the least injured. "
6061,Man City,"Pep wil always start Gundo. Love him, but he is not that guy as a dm anymore. "
6062,Man City,Gundogan again 💀 
6063,Man City,"Guys im feeling it, gundo is clutching it tonight 🩵🙏😭 ![gif](giphy|ckGndVa23sCk9pae4l)"

6066,Man City,Got to be kidding 
6067,Man City,Wtf was that and seriously wtf😡 
6068,Man City,"What does Pep sees in Lewis?
He’s the Shortest, Weakest, Slowest player on the team!
He can’t cross, can’t shoot, can’t dribble, can’t finish!
He can’t win Aerial Duels or Ground Duels!
He keeps on falling over!
What does he actually do apart from short passing and recieving? Did you miss the 6 weeks at the start of the season where he was arguably one of the best players in the team? Or did you only start supporting city last week?

Also, we don’t chat shit about young talent here."
6069,Man City,What is Pep seeing in this double pivot man : 😭. We are getting battered with this double pivot for the past 5 games. 
6070,Man City,"I’m just begging for Jacob Wright to get some minutes. Who knows what will happen? I know a double pivot with Gundo ain’t it though. Me too, along with Nico. Tall guys, good physically, can run. All 3 things currently missing "
6071,Man City,Maybe Nunes instead of Bernardo as the second pivot? 
6072,Man City,Hopefully save him for Liverpool I guess it's best not to risk him today then
6073,Man City,Yeah wtf is going on with him. Starting to think there’s more to it. 
6074,Man City,He said he got pain free just last Friday so he’ll probably come on today and start the next ine 
6075,Man City,HAHAHA no 
6076,Man City,Haha you're funny! 
6077,Man City,Your favourite! Hmmmmm I think Ortega might be my unofficial fave cos I fancy him but nunes is up there

6079,Man City,Well at least Walker isn’t starting! That’s one good thing! Rico isn’t much of an improvement if one at all
6080,Man City,Shove Javi Garcia up top whilst you’re at it 
6081,Man City,And maybe drop to a 532 since we keep letting people score He said in the recent press meet that he won't give up his philosophy 😭.

6092,Man City,"Rico isn’t much of an improvement if one at all Rico is still infinitely better than Walker.

He was one of our best players at the start of the season, while Walker's gone a full year without a decent game."
6093,Man City,He said in the recent press meet that he won't give up his philosophy 😭. Look I'm not saying he needs to give up his philosophy it obviously has been a winner but when the team cannot perform just adjust until the transfer window and get some better midfielders. Also put KDB in the first half and sub him out the second
6094,Man City,No playtime’s gonna make him rusty I'm not calling the shots hahaha. He was also our best player on the pitch when he came on against Tot (not saying much). Maybe they give him another 30 minutes tonight then start him v pool.

He ain't the center of the problem he's been one of our best players since he debute & keeps rising."
6098,Man City,Maybe he will have a few minutes when Pep finally decides to use subs at 85 minutes! When we’re 2-0 down can’t wait 🤩 I don't understand why he makes those subs late into the game when we clearly need them early in the 2nd half especially when we're trailing

6106,Man City,"So frustrating to watch.  Let the youngsters play.  It can't be worse than that. He tried his best but damn his legs are lost. Pep must be sadist. 

Walker on the other hand, thought he still had bursting pace and actually allowed Werner to run through 🤦‍♂️"
6107,Man City,"He shouldn't be playing there to begin with. Yep, should be a rotation option playing as a creative 8 higher up.

Playing him every game and making him carry the defensive duty is just too much."
6108,Man City,Id rather o Reilly play instead 
6109,Man City,"He was never a speed demon and Johnson’s legs were much fresher. That being said, he looked pretty cooked on that run "
6110,Man City,Pep should've adapted his tactics according to the condition of his players. I would'nt bother to play with tje ball. When I'm pairing gundogan with lewis as double pivot. I would look for counter play. Pep have used counter attacking tactics during his stay at bayern. Why is he hesitating to adapt? We expect too much from Pep as well. Like relying on him to fix things every time. I wonder what would happen if we signed another manager.
6111,Man City,"If you have to run, then you’ve already made a mistake "
6112,Man City,I bet they'd fucking love Sarr 
6113,Man City,"His knee was shot when we bought him, now he's barely mobile. That year in Spain broke the guy. Guy’s old. He should be playing once or twice a month, and be there as a Scott Carson of midfielders, coaching the youngsters. 

But he’s having to play full 90 mins every three days."
6114,Man City,What happens when you wait till there is 15 mins in the game left to make subs 
6115,Man City,man that’s just sad 
6116,Man City,I get it BUT why give up so close to the area? 
6117,Man City,"Tbh, pace was never gundo' strong suit. It's the other things. "
6118,Man City,Where was Gvardiol going? 
6119,Man City,"Without being able to start/play KDB, Rodri, Kovi.. Pep didn’t have many other options to play in that position. With knowing that, city should have planned to play the outside backs more conservatively where the CM doesn’t get caught in this position to chase a winger. But let’s be real.. Rodri or Kovi aren’t catching him either so you can’t blame Gundi for this play "
6120,Man City,"Why are so many people in here acting like he ever was fast to begin with. That fact that he is in this situation to begin with shows things have broken down way before this.

Gundogan job isn’t to make full speed tackles on the last man. Why are we if ignoring the Gvardiol sized hole on the left created by Peps tactics? I’d argue this is on Pep for not adjusting his tactics to the players available to him. "
6121,Man City,Tbf at no point in Gundo’s career is he getting there 
6122,Man City,Wdym at this point? At no point in his career was he ever quicker than Brennan Johnson lol 
6123,Man City,"I’m not even a City fan but this is stupid.

Brennan Johnson is FAST. He would’ve ran past Rodri, (if he didn’t tactical foul) Nunes, Kovacic, Philips, and most midfielders on other prem teams the same way. gundo shouldn’t be in a position where he even needs to do this, much less the fact he’s not capable of it "
6124,Man City,That hurts to watch. Him trying his best but still not being nowhere close to johnson. 
6125,Man City,Moving like molasses 
6126,Man City,"We don’t got the players to play kind of high risk football, Pep needs to adapt to protect his players it won’t pretty to look at but its necessary "
6127,Man City,"Woah, its worse than I remembered 😬 "
6128,Man City,"as a Barca fan really didn't expect to play like this. he was our POTS (him or Yamal, him for me he was very consistent) "
6129,Man City,But what was Walker doing?! He didn’t start running until Werner was passed him 
6130,Man City,I mean this is almost exactly like he was 5 years ago. He was always slow and close to useless as a transitional defender. 
6131,Man City,"🤍🤍♥️♥️

![gif](giphy|OX25cp7DL6Bt81Yb47|downsized) "
6132,Man City,They should’ve never brought back GG ( Geriatric Gundo). He should join MLS. 😅 
6133,Man City,"He tried his best but damn his legs are lost. Pep must be sadist. 

Walker on the other hand, thought he still had bursting pace and actually allowed Werner to run through 🤦‍♂️ It's hard to watch some of our club icons age.  But, it's a young man's game.  We desperately need to make some changes."
6134,Man City,"Yep, should be a rotation option playing as a creative 8 higher up.

6135,Man City,"We expect too much from Pep as well. Like relying on him to fix things every time. I wonder what would happen if we signed another manager. He is the Coach, and I reckon fixing things is part of his job. But I get your point. He has done more than we deserve, and we love and respect him for that. Oh man, it would be hard for that manager, to fill into Pep's shoes. He will find it easy to work wktht he players. Just look at how easily arne slot is able to work with Liverpool players, all players signed by jurgen. Thats also because both managers had similar tactics or playing style. It'll be hard to bring in any manager who plays like pep, playingwith ball and keeping possession. If the players doesn't fit his requirements he'll have to sign new players and make them settle into his tactics."

6141,Man City,100% 
6142,Man City,"Nunes and Phillips didn't help For me, the jury is still out on Nunes.  If ever he was going to step up and make a name for himself, now is the time.  I think he has a lot more potential than Phillips.  Not saying he's the answer, but let's see if he can make a contribution during our injury crisis."

Ill watch us lose 5 more.

6163,Man City,"Come on KDB! 

Feels like its been soo long since we had a 90min KDB game!

I may be on my own with this thinking but, KDBs passing is 2nd to none. If we can get a DM who can cover mid and suport the defence allowing KDB to roam and not exhaust himself i think it will give us more KDB time and make us more of a threat.

Being a threat on goal isnt our issue.

I dotn even mind not being able to convert our chances, that is football, luck plays a part.

But.... our defence needs some serious work. Them fucking counters need to be dissolved massively. 

Roll on tonights game, hope KDB gets to start! "

Before Rodri's injury though, we were god-like. Haaland almost scored 3 hattricks in a row. I thought this might be another treble winning season. But alas. That's an excellent point. KDB was feeding Haaland hatricks then it all went to shit. Foden was supposed to fill KDB'S shoes but he didn't. KDB is our hope while Rodri is out."

6209,Man City,"How the fuck can we score three and then concede three of the shittest goals… fucking embarrassing, this defence needs to sort its shit out and fast "
6210,Man City,LOSING STREAK OVER!!! 
6211,Man City,"oh wow, a foul against Haaland is called, the first time ever RIGHT lol"
6212,Man City,This is the funniest run of form I've ever seen 
6213,Man City,If Walker starts a single game from now Pep has lost it He'll prolly start vs Liverpool LMAO Oh he will definitely start against Liverpool
6214,Man City,Matheus Nunes!!! For the love of God don’t bench him for Bernado on Sunday. Please baldy! 
6215,Man City,The rehaul this summer is gonna be monumental 
6216,Man City,"Guys, why does it say 3 next to our team name??? I believe those were called gools. I don’t know, it’s been awhile. Losses, just needs to catch up with reality"
6217,Man City,Man City 3 - [3] Feyenoord 90+2 Gvardiol O.G 
6218,Man City,Giving up a three goal lead in the last 15 minutes is a new and exciting way to lose a game. 
6219,Man City,"Got to fix this defense. when you put 3 in, that should be a win majority of the time. But we can't keep teams out of the net. "
6220,Man City,![gif](giphy|DrcqyC7RW0Dyu798GJ|downsized) 
6221,Man City,Nunes put on some gloves and turned into Mahrez 😂 I am absolutely here for Champions League Gloved Nunes
6222,Man City,We’re so back 💀💀💀 
6223,Man City,We’ll get slaughtered at Anfield. This midfield is going to get ran through. Gundo offers nothing. Hopefully not😭
6224,Man City,"Pep, start the sub, Gvardiol needs a fucking rest "
6225,Man City,So refreshing to see Nunes attempting forward passes as against Bernado dribbling himself so much that other players literally stop moving. 
6226,Man City,I like how Everytime rico has the ball and someone is making a run he just complete ignores then and proceeds to pass backwards 
6227,Man City,Our defending is actually hilarious 
6228,Man City,"Should have been 5:0, but instead it's 3:2 "
6229,Man City,![gif](giphy|R9cQo06nQBpRe) 
6230,Man City,Maybe let Ortega play every once in awhile? Why doesn't Pep change anything? 
6231,Man City,We are due for a grealish screamer come on Almost!!!!! Wow
6232,Man City,It’s just funny at this point isn’t it 
6233,Man City,Hell will freeze over before the universe let's jack score 
6234,Man City,We're gonna get smashed on Sunday 
6235,Man City,"Ederson might as well be sitting on the sideline without the defense protecting him. Defense is shit, and he should be protected but you expect more from your #1 keeper. If Pep is serious about salvaging this season he will drop him for Ortega "
6236,Man City,I just can’t believe we were so naive that we didn’t slow the game and sit in the corner. Just absolute nonsense 
6237,Man City,a City documentary on this season would go diamond 
6238,Man City,Rodri and Dias are the two keys missing to our team 
6239,Man City,Man they are gonna score on their first attempt on target aren’t they lol 
6240,Man City,What does Bernardo do anymore Run a lot😃👍 Got downvoted for saying that. Hilarious fanbase. Still thinks this is 2018 Bernardo
6241,Man City,Nunes has to be in the side for his legs until we get through this patch. 
6242,Man City,"My god, the amount of complaining in this thread. Count yourself lucky you weren't fans back when we were actually rubbish... Crazy isn’t it! I’m like confused I thought we got a pen but everyone was so mad in here I’ll admit some people are doing a bit too much, but there is nothing wrong with complaining about players that are paid millions to entertain us when they’re not playing at their expected level. We pay money to watch these games, we’re owed at least something"
6243,Man City,why is pep bleeding lol 
6244,Man City,Haven’t celebrated a city pen like that in years 😅 LMAO Fr I got hyped
6245,Man City,"Haaland being Foden, Foden being Haaland wtf "
6246,Man City,"Eddie outside the box clearance! We are back lads we are soo back, cant wait for eddie to nutmeg salah on sunday"
6247,Man City,Get some minutes in Kev before Sunday now 
6248,Man City,"Every time KdB has the ball....""dontgetinjured....dontgetinjured..dontgetinjured...dontgetinjured..dontgetinjured...dontgetinjured..."" Literally every step he takes atm"
6249,Man City,"Made a few fuck ups Gvardiol.... what's going on with him? He's been playing every minute going up and down the pitch constantly, lad must be exhausted. Mentally not just physically."
6250,Man City,Gvardiol with the hospital pass that led to this goal It’s just dumb why are you passing into the middle of the pitch right in front of our box when he’s going to get pressed by two players from opposite directions.
6251,Man City,"Liverpool are gonna wreck us, hopefully we can avoid worse than 5-0 "
6252,Man City,Just one mistake and we look like absolute shit again 
6253,Man City,fake covid tests and dont go to anfield i beg 
6254,Man City,Ederson what in the what 
6255,Man City,we are finishing mid table this season We're lucky we started okay or we might be relegated
6256,Man City,4-3 Feyenoord surely 
6257,Man City,this after game talk is gonna be worse than “sit down nobody talk” 
6258,Man City,We still have to play Juve and Psg btw 
6259,Man City,Sickening. GG 
6260,Man City,I already like the energy from Nunes in midfield. 
6261,Man City,I like Nunes’s energy. We need more of that 
6262,Man City,Seeing Arsenal 2 up already against Sporting is really rubbing the salt in Gyokeres showing to Arteta he can adapt to Arsenal’s striker profile by not scoring any goals Sporting played against our depleted team and Arsenal played with their full strength tonight plus Amorim is not there anymore.
6263,Man City,"Ayyyyeeee credit where it’s due, good take Gundo! "
6264,Man City,Also huge respect to nunes there for changing it up. Same position last time he shot. Would have definitely thrown keeper off 
6265,Man City,Every game I watch I get more convinced Nunes should be our right winger. He feeds haaland whenever he gets into that polar of the pitch. 
6266,Man City,Would’ve been legendary 
6267,Man City,that would have been an amazing goal 
6268,Man City,Nunes kinda looks like 17/18 Kun Too skinny Specially with them gloves
6269,Man City,We’re back?  Cant say so till we win at Anfield but hey thats hell of a confidence boost.
6270,Man City,Bring off Bernardo so he's well rested for his annual Anfield masterclass. 
6271,Man City,Gvardiol keeps making the same mistakes in every game 🤦🏾‍♂️ 
6272,Man City,Pep is fucking pissed 
6273,Man City,That's actually fucking funny considering that Gvardiol was great the whole evening lmao 
6274,Man City,it’s not a city game if we don’t have a moment a calm and then turns into panic in the last 15 mins 
6275,Man City,It’s actually quite funny at this point tbf 
6276,Man City,Ederson on the hook for #2 and #3 
6277,Man City,"Dropped from 5 to 15 in the standings, lol. "
6278,Man City,If we just refuse to show up against Liverpool they’ll award liverpool a 3-0 win… might be our best bet 
6279,Man City,no win november is crazy 
6280,Man City,"This is actually worse than spurs because at least they played better. The mentality is abysmal, they just don’t care "
6281,Man City,We quite literally have no midfield or defense stability 
6282,Man City,we’re so back 
6283,Man City,We figured out the scoring now the defense is all that’s left 
6284,Man City,Nunes is a breath of fresh air 
6285,Man City,"There’s the old Phil there, love it. "
6286,Man City,Much more positive from the lads today 
6287,Man City,As good as we've been this screams 30 yard stunner from them 
6288,Man City,Sunday is gonna be terrifying. I really hope I don’t witness a slaughter 
6289,Man City,Bro they’re gonna get a goal with the space they’re getting 
6290,Man City,"Grealish is really bothering those players lol, they are fouling him like shit "
6291,Man City,"Bernardo is either tired asf, or he just simply doesn't care anymore m I think its both honestly."
6292,Man City,We need a new set piece coach 
6293,Man City,always disrupting the counter with this pass backwards shit 
6294,Man City,YES. Bury this Erling. We NEED it. 
6295,Man City,I miss 22/23 Bernardo I deeply miss that false 9 era Silva
6296,Man City,Good work Rico! 
6297,Man City,Gyokeres doesn’t even have a shot so far… Fucking turned into Prime Zlatan against us That's because there's a competent defense infront of him.
6298,Man City,Ricoo 💪 
6299,Man City,"Second goal LETS GO! He's so back!


(Hope..)"
6300,Man City,"Gundo heard us all trashing him and responded with that haha. 

GET IN "
6301,Man City,GUNDO WHAT A PASS and YES ERLING!!!!! 
6302,Man City,Oh yes oh yes bring back tap in Haaland 1st this season  We will take our tap in merchant any day of the week after what happened the last few weeks
6303,Man City,Honestly if Matheus keeps getting regular starts and keeps this form up he could be in line for our player of the season Think he has competition with Josko if he pulls out some stunners
6304,Man City,"I've been saying the last few games - if we fix our problems in attack, the defence will sort itself out. I think this game has proven that so far. I disagree. Pep fixed the midfield this game so we weren't as vualnerable to the counter. We second in the league for goals scored so attack was not an issue"
6305,Man City,Foden with these turns 🤤 
6306,Man City,Bernardo has put a shift in but with the ball he's been all over the shop 
6307,Man City,Had a chance for a killer ball and played it wide bruh Yeah wtf was that lmao i don't think haaland has had that much space the entire game. The boys need to trust haaland more Yeah wtf was that lmao i don't think haaland has had that much space the entire game. The boys need to trust haaland more Yeah wtf was that lmao i don't think haaland has had that much space the entire game. The boys need to trust haaland more
6308,Man City,"I feel like we have already gone beyond expectations, I never dreamed of trebles, 4 in a row and Rodri winning a freaking ballon d or, time to sit back support the team , anything the boys win is a complete bonus in my opinion and hope all the players come back strong. I strongly concur with this. We’ve literally won more than you can hope to in a lifetime. From here on out it’s just gravy. CTID. I said this when we won the FA Cup in 2011 that was me happy…  the last 13 years have been beyond anything I could have imagined. I think this season is gonna end up being a write off but I’m absolutely cool with that. We will be back. Absolutely I dont mind if we finish 4th or whatever this season. Let the kids fail for a change for god’s sake. Even the perfectly engineered machines fail sometimes. As long as United are below us, I am good lol. That was my take last season and I still totally agree. Three in a row was huge, the quadruple, CL treble, 100 points, we've seen it all over the last few years. The fourth PL was massive, no doubt, but a top four finish this time - even trophyless - wouldn't be some big disaster. We can take an L every so often."
6309,Man City,"If we win this year, the meltdown would be unreal🤣 Exactly and I hope we do. Liverpool already saying Slot is better than Pep because he's winning without signing anybody. Liverpool will drop points on Sunday, Pep has a plan."
6310,Man City,"Even if we are trophyless this season, I'll still watch the game and support my players. We're really spoiled last couple of years as citizens. Well done you for literally doing the same as every other fan for their club in the entire country"
6311,Man City,City used to demolish teams firing from all cylinders. Now we are too reserved with 1 goalscorer. 
6312,Man City,We can only compete if we bring reinforcements in January other than that I don't see a title challenge. 
6313,Man City,how are we getting cooked left right and center and still 2nd btw💀💀 
6314,Man City,Christ 
6315,Man City,I mean it's definitely possible if we get our heads right 
6316,Man City,"It is not over, we will begin by winning them over the weekend "
6317,Man City,If liverpool wins is over 
6318,Man City,"We don't have to win all the games, we just need them to lose most of it.

![gif](giphy|d3mlE7uhX8KFgEmY) "
6319,Man City,12 games played.... 
6320,Man City,"Liverpool are still in transition, no matter how good the start of the season has been. They are picking up points from tight games.

Also have 24hrs less recovery time this weekend after a much tougher CL opponent. "
6321,Man City,"Proper arsenal levels of hope this, let’s just take it match by match and see what happens. "
6322,Man City,"So, it will be done next week "
6323,Man City,"Technically we are only 2 points behind Liverpool, if we beat them twice. I don’t see them continuing their form and for the most part we have been average this season and are still second and with some players out of form. Liverpool are going to try to capitalise as much as possible on City and Arsenal slowing down, unless they fall to the same mistake of going through draws and random losses from Jan to April, this year is their year."
6324,Man City,"Only 3 times, teams have been 8 points clear at this point in the league. All 3 of those teams went on to win a PL "
6325,Man City,"Lol, cope "
6326,Man City,Nicely spoken Sherlock 
6327,Man City,I strongly concur with this. We’ve literally won more than you can hope to in a lifetime. From here on out it’s just gravy. CTID.

6329,Man City,"Absolutely I dont mind if we finish 4th or whatever this season. Let the kids fail for a change for god’s sake. Even the perfectly engineered machines fail sometimes. As long as United are below us, I am good lol. "
6330,Man City,"That was my take last season and I still totally agree. Three in a row was huge, the quadruple, CL treble, 100 points, we've seen it all over the last few years. The fourth PL was massive, no doubt, but a top four finish this time - even trophyless - wouldn't be some big disaster. We can take an L every so often. "
6331,Man City,"Exactly and I hope we do. Liverpool already saying Slot is better than Pep because he's winning without signing anybody. Liverpool will drop points on Sunday, Pep has a plan. Not a single person is saying this. Liverpool fan, no one is saying that. At least not on reddit as they'll get downvoted to oblivion. Everyone is cautious as city always goes on a insane unbeaten run. 

We're just buzzing to be competing with the best again. As long arsenal lose, we're happy."
6332,Man City,Well done you for literally doing the same as every other fan for their club in the entire country 
6333,Man City,"Liverpool are going to try to capitalise as much as possible on City and Arsenal slowing down, unless they fall to the same mistake of going through draws and random losses from Jan to April, this year is their year. I mean yeah but it’s not like they would do anything different it we were in front or if it was only a point or 2"
6334,Man City,Not a single person is saying this. Go check the comments on YouTube.
6335,Man City,"Liverpool fan, no one is saying that. At least not on reddit as they'll get downvoted to oblivion. Everyone is cautious as city always goes on a insane unbeaten run.

6336,Man City,I mean yeah but it’s not like they would do anything different it we were in front or if it was only a point or 2 Love the idea of us winning over them home and away but… we don’t have the tools to make it happen. Luis Diaz and Mo Salah are in the form of their lives… we need Dias a lot for the Sunday game.
6337,Man City,Go check the comments on YouTube. Thats the most brain-dead platform youre hearing from.. half of the people of yt dont even watch football theyre just commenting for attention Willingly? Don't do that to yourself
6338,Man City,"Love the idea of us winning over them home and away but… we don’t have the tools to make it happen. Luis Diaz and Mo Salah are in the form of their lives… we need Dias a lot for the Sunday game. Every game is a new game, we still have a talented squad with the same manager who’s done things no other club has ever done in England. I’ll back us always"
6339,Man City,Thats the most brain-dead platform youre hearing from.. half of the people of yt dont even watch football theyre just commenting for attention 
6340,Man City,Willingly? Don't do that to yourself 
6341,Man City,"Every game is a new game, we still have a talented squad with the same manager who’s done things no other club has ever done in England. I’ll back us always "
6342,Man City,We are finished. 
6343,Man City,LOL 
6344,Man City,"What is “were so back” in Dutch?

Edit: we zijn zo terug 🗣️🔥🔥🔥 We zijn zo erg terug! 🔴⚪️⚫️"
6345,Man City,Good god 
6346,Man City,"I don’t even have words anymore. 
Not having dangerous wingers which take all attention of defenders… I miss that. 

Sane & Sterling used to be world’s best wingers… 

Now it’s a smiling grealish who lets ball trickle to him and hopes to get a block shot for corner, and Bernardo who is as ineffectual as me on that wing. 

Nunes obviously needs to start at anfield to have some chance. 

I really don’t know how pep will start both foden & kdb. Foden rw surely. 
Bernardo will be pivot with nunes? Idk. Gundo would be a passenger. 

Sigh. 
Such weird times in a space of a month. lol ffs. I’m done with Grealish tbh. 100 mil just to have one really good season"
6347,Man City,"City's whole defense stinks. Walker, Lewis,Pusey and Gvardiol, just aren't good enough. Ake, Akanji and Stones too injury-prone. We need to invest in the defense for next season. "
6348,Man City,Fuck man why does this keep happening what is going on w our club man like why can’t they beat teams like this so frustrating 
6349,Man City,We zijn zo erg terug! 🔴⚪️⚫️ 🥹
6350,Man City,I’m done with Grealish tbh. 100 mil just to have one really good season 
6351,Man City,🥹 
6352,Man City,"This was arne slot previous team, right? Yep"
6353,Man City,"Do you guys think De Bruyne will start this match? Doubt it, get a few minutes at the end if we are in a decent position. Liverpool on the weekend is huge and Feyenoord have some players out with injury."
6354,Man City,Can we win a game? 
6355,Man City,Nothing is easy in the ucl. Remember lyon guys? That was never going to be an easy game
6356,Man City,"Just need a win, no matter what "
6357,Man City,Wel I look forward to Thursdays chip paper pouring scorn onto another incredibly surprising result. 
6358,Man City,Savinho goal. £100 wager for PayPal lads? Pm me 
6359,Man City,Need to break this losing streak so atleast we dont have to hear 7 losses in a row after Liverpool 
6360,Man City,Easy win So only a six nil loss? yikes
6361,Man City,Yep 
6362,Man City,"Doubt it, get a few minutes at the end if we are in a decent position. Liverpool on the weekend is huge and Feyenoord have some players out with injury. "
6363,Man City,That was never going to be an easy game 
6364,Man City,So only a six nil loss? 
6365,Man City,yikes 
6366,Man City,Inevitable goal on first shot on target by Feyenoord. We will be there. Their first counter attack you mean?
6367,Man City,"Kyle after the match, with yet another poetry. "
6368,Man City,I love City but given the teams we've lost to in this run so far today and the weekend are the biggest test. 
6369,Man City,![gif](giphy|Cs7mzuvjpTuVd5lQMO) 
6370,Man City,![gif](giphy|MVG619LTIVCIfGmIW8) 
6371,Man City,Their first counter attack you mean? 
6372,Man City,"We cannot sign those players because they simply do not exist. There is nobody good enough to replace Rodri at the desired/needed level AND also displace Kovacic/Gündogan/KDB/Foden/Bernardo when Rodri is fit. Same with Haaland, there simply is no striker that can adequately replace him AND beat out Grealish/Savinho/Doku/Bernardo on the wings (because Messi has left his prime some years ago).

I agree we desperately need reinforcements, but for the most part we will either have buy backups or turn one of our starters into a backup and then sell them below market value within a year tops (see Alvarez). The best teams in this century all had a few players that knew, they were backups and were happy with that. It saved the teams from unnecessary spending and turnover and in return gave them players that could make up for some of their individual shortcomings by knowing the system so well, they would slot right in when needed. Keita for Peps Barca, Rafinha or Bernat for his Bayern, Vazquez or Nacho for Real. This is why guys like Alvarez are nice; invest in the youth and they’ll either become really good or preserve some value while filling in holes. What about when the quality of the starting 11 is not great ? I personally the examples I gave are pretty realistic except maybe Isak but my argument is that it’s stupid to spend ridiculous amounts on players that don’t improve the squad other than Gvardiol, Dias, Rodri and Haaland there’s a lot of room for improvement"
6373,Man City,"Why are people counting out akanji and ake pretty sure they aren’t even 30 yet defense we need to get a rb 

Midfield a cdm and a cam and that’s it Akanji is having a terrible season I’ve lost count of the number of goals he’s personally responsible for and don’t even get me started on Lewis."
6374,Man City,"OH MY GOD!!!! I saw Tapsoba there and I nearly fell of my chair. If you want to shorten your lifespan by 15 years, just get Tapsoba as a CB for your club. To be fair Akanji also has the frequent bozo moment in him, wouldn’t be typical Citeh if he didn’t 😂"
6375,Man City,"Agree with your take.  The sad part is City can't depend on a healthy KDB.  I think Bruno G fits because he can play further forward if needed.  You ""hope"" Rodri comes back and is 100% healthy but ACL's aren't easy.  So you have to sign someone with the thought that Rodri takes a full year to get back to his level and KDB is out 50% of the season.   I think you can find better then Kova and Gundo at this point (they are both servicable but not day-to-day starters for a championship team).  I think getting Oscar Bobb back is a big deal as well if he returns to form. Yes !!!"
6376,Man City,"Also zubimendi ppl forget that pep played with 2 dms last year kovacic and Rodri 
 
With Rodri being more attacking and kova staying back zubimendi could take on kovas role 

And with the amount of matches we play both kova and zubimendi will get loads of matches o I don’t remember it that way I can’t lie, because when ever Kovacic would do his usual carrying Rodri would stay back. Zubimendi is always one who stays back it’s why they rarely play together in Spain (I’m using the word rarely because they probably have played together in games I haven’t seen) having Rodri be the one who’s more “attacking” is removing from what has him names the best player in the world"
6377,Man City,"The problem is that we need multiple viable options in each position because of the ever expanding season demands. Hard to sign a world class player and then tell them they are a rotational player. Hence having to pay more to get someone in that spot. 

Be a starter on team X or an “important” squad player at City. "
6378,Man City,"You’re entirely right and it’s what I’ve been saying for awhile. You can’t buy a top of the market player to sit on the bench. Why would Zubimendy pass on Liverpool when he could come be a bench option next year for the reigning Ballon D’Or winner? Exactly and Rodri is thee best player in the world in his position (overall too obviously) so you don’t sign Zubimendi and play Rodri further forward, that’s why he’s no our guy. Our guy is easily Bruno G and after stupidly missing out on the reasonable RC I think City should be prepared to overpay zubamendi could likely adapt to play in a number of positions, like most city players"
6379,Man City,"The headline is nonesense tbh. The lack of backups is biting us seriously in the ass at the moment. The sheer number of games means we should have at least a decent second team that regularly plays in say the League and FA Cup competitions plus rotates in to give others rest.

We have the money. We’ve won four titles on the run most players would be happy to join us and work with Pep. Chelsea clearly take the idea of a large squad too far but we take the idea of a small squad too the other extreme. "
6380,Man City,"Can't believe anyone would argue we don't have gaps in our squad. Several key players are moving into their mid 30s, and several more are frequently unfit. 

Having players like Kovacic who can come in here and there is important, as is their versatility. "
6381,Man City,"The idea around this is that the gap between your starting 11 and players on the bench shouldn’t huge (for rotation) we have 2 goalkeepers and like 3 academy guys on our bench every week and that’s with everybody fit, you don’t win trophies that way I mean we have won trophies this way Unless you’re counting Lewis and Bobb as the academy guys I’m not sure bench you’re looking at. 

You: “You don’t win trophies that way”
Me: Points at Pep’s career."
6382,Man City,This is why guys like Alvarez are nice; invest in the youth and they’ll either become really good or preserve some value while filling in holes. 
6383,Man City,"What about when the quality of the starting 11 is not great ? I personally the examples I gave are pretty realistic except maybe Isak but my argument is that it’s stupid to spend ridiculous amounts on players that don’t improve the squad other than Gvardiol, Dias, Rodri and Haaland there’s a lot of room for improvement You can’t improve on the best. You have to buy players that are very good and you hope can grow. There is risk with every purchase. For example, de bruyne was a reject when he joined city; we saw potential in him and grew him into a beast. Then don't spend ridiculous amounts. All the career backups I listed were dirt cheap compared to whoever started ahead of them. 

And I honestly don't know most footballers from their face alone. So I can't comment on most of your pictures. 

Isak would be one of the most braindead moves we could make under your premise as well as under mine. He very likely won't be better than Haaland, but is too good to warm the bench for more than a few weeks. And he will definitely not start in any other position, because he is a pure 9.

Wirtz does not suit our needs IMO. He's a slightly stronger defender than Foden but nowhere near good enough in that regard to play alongside him in midfield. Also neither are build up players, they belong around the opposition's box. So one of them gets wasted out wide or sits on the bench. Either way, that one leaves after a year (for considerably less than he is worth). You’ll get no better with replacing foden, Doku, Savihno and Lewis these guys are near irreplaceable in my opinion they just are too good"
6384,Man City,Akanji is having a terrible season I’ve lost count of the number of goals he’s personally responsible for and don’t even get me started on Lewis. Not sure why are you being downvoted but it’s true. Lewis is just not strong enough and Akanji isn’t himself
6385,Man City,"To be fair Akanji also has the frequent bozo moment in him, wouldn’t be typical Citeh if he didn’t 😂 My fellow cityzen, you are not prepared for having Tapsoba in your team. I don't even support Leverkusen, but I SCREAM whenever I watch him play.

Imagine this: the opposition is attacking, but Leverkusen have their 3 CBs in the perfect position, holding a good line. They are just waiting for the subpar attacking midfielder to make the wrong decision, then they'll pounce and win the ball back. But no, Sir Tapsoba, First of His Name, decides to step out from his position and challenge. The midfielder immediately passes the ball past him, into the now empty space, and now the opposition winger has a 1v1 with the goalkeeper. GOAL. He does this every week. You are not prepared."
6386,Man City,Yes !!! 
6387,Man City,"I don’t remember it that way I can’t lie, because when ever Kovacic would do his usual carrying Rodri would stay back. Zubimendi is always one who stays back it’s why they rarely play together in Spain (I’m using the word rarely because they probably have played together in games I haven’t seen) having Rodri be the one who’s more “attacking” is removing from what has him names the best player in the world "
6388,Man City,"Exactly and Rodri is thee best player in the world in his position (overall too obviously) so you don’t sign Zubimendi and play Rodri further forward, that’s why he’s no our guy. Our guy is easily Bruno G and after stupidly missing out on the reasonable RC I think City should be prepared to overpay "
6389,Man City,"zubamendi could likely adapt to play in a number of positions, like most city players Very true, but what if he wants to be a CDM? As we just saw with Alvarez, we asked him to play out of position for 2 seasons, then he bounced because he wasn't getting the minutes he wanted in his preferred position."
6390,Man City,"I mean we have won trophies this way And now we look so off the pace because our most important pieces have been playing in a ridiculous amount of games. Legs gone, hunger gone"
6391,Man City,"Unless you’re counting Lewis and Bobb as the academy guys I’m not sure bench you’re looking at. 

You: “You don’t win trophies that way”
Me: Points at Pep’s career. "
6392,Man City,"You can’t improve on the best. You have to buy players that are very good and you hope can grow. There is risk with every purchase. For example, de bruyne was a reject when he joined city; we saw potential in him and grew him into a beast. No Kevin was already a beast after that season @ Wolfsburg or else we would’ve haven’t spend 67Ms or something on him, Kevin was a big improvement on what we had, Sterling same season was a big improvement we had. We live in a world where Kovacic who was a Chelsea squad player starting every week and Kyle Walker is our senior Right back and you’re telling me there’s no room for improvement ?"
6393,Man City,"Then don't spend ridiculous amounts. All the career backups I listed were dirt cheap compared to whoever started ahead of them. 

And I honestly don't know most footballers from their face alone. So I can't comment on most of your pictures. 

Isak would be one of the most braindead moves we could make under your premise as well as under mine. He very likely won't be better than Haaland, but is too good to warm the bench for more than a few weeks. And he will definitely not start in any other position, because he is a pure 9.

Wirtz does not suit our needs IMO. He's a slightly stronger defender than Foden but nowhere near good enough in that regard to play alongside him in midfield. Also neither are build up players, they belong around the opposition's box. So one of them gets wasted out wide or sits on the bench. Either way, that one leaves after a year (for considerably less than he is worth). I think they could because I see Foden out-wide(I don’t really want to get into this conversation again 😂) but Wirtz definitely suits our needs because if anything we NEED a passer because outside of Kevin we don’t have any…whatever I’m talking more archetypes than actually names (a passer and a goal threat)"
6394,Man City,"You’ll get no better with replacing foden, Doku, Savihno and Lewis these guys are near irreplaceable in my opinion they just are too good "
6395,Man City,Not sure why are you being downvoted but it’s true. Lewis is just not strong enough and Akanji isn’t himself I’m watching the game now and I don’t think Lewis has been anywhere near RB the position he’s supposed to be playing since the game began! He literally just goes where he wants and wrecks whatever shape our defence has. He leaves acres of space open on the right for a counter attack. I seriously believe we’d be far better playing 3 at the back.

How many from your computer chair?

He'll sort it.

The solution in 2022-23 was an unheard of 17 year old from our academy who transformed how we played and resulted in the departure of someone who'd arguably been the best full back in Europe in the previous 18 months."

And those signings of KDB and Sterling happened almost a decade ago when our squad was nowhere near the level it is now. 

Kovacic was a starter under every competent manager Chelsea had. And we could only sign him when Gündogan left, because he is too good to sit on our bench all season. Prime Gündogan was better, yes, but Kovacic was by far the best replacement on the market that year (and probably still is the best replacement we could have bought in the 18 months since).

Kyle Walker could be improved upon, but this is a very recent development. Also he's probably still the best at his specific style, so we'll have to adjust the system to something different, which we seem to be trying with Rico. 

Also having the literal ""best in slot"" player for every position is not realistic."

I'm not getting into it with someone trotting out stuff like this.

Where are you getting that from?? ""Reeling"", from two seasons ago? He didn't play every game last year, he benefited from a full off season this year, but you reckon the 50 matches he played 2 years ago have him out?

That's not how any of this works."

We have a Rodri shaped hole for crying out loud, Dias and Akanji have joined Stones and Ake in being injury prone and also KDB ???. I’m just trying to have a conversation here because if you remember the treble season is where a lot of this started because we went all the way playing the same XI week in week out aside from ST(Alvarez and F9den) and RW(Foden and Mahrez) where we would frequently rotate. No indication that any of the problems he's experienced this year are remotely related to last season. None of the injuries have been specified. And some of his absence last year was illness related, another was the burglary.

He came through pre season talking about how good he was feeling and how well he'd prepared, only to get a knock in training before the community shield. A knock isn't something last season would have impacted.

My question for you to go away and think about is: why are you getting so worked up about it?

You have no control over this. Pep ain't reading your diatribes. Neither is Txkiki, Ferran or Hugo. Even if they did, you and I probably know less than 10% of what's going on in terms of player fitness, mental state, family situations, transfer negotiations, and the million and one other things that affect the individuals involve, so any theories on how to fix the problems are going to be laughably wide of the mark.

And no matter what happens, you'll still be a blue in the morning.

So get your scarf on (and more if you're coming to the ground tonight because it's fucking freezing here), watch the game, sing to the end, enjoy the wins, commiserate the losses, and then do it all again next time. Because that's what we do. It's all you can do."

6414,Man City,"Pep would have to lose 3/4 years in a row for us to ever think about it Don't want Pool, Assna or Chelsea winning the league😭🤢🤢 As an outsider, it's totally the team's fault why city is losing , still have the highest X/G in prem for offence, the squad revamp is what necessary for city , some of the players don't have legs anymore also Phil phoden is underperforming with kbd back things will get better in offence"
6415,Man City,"very true. This just shows that our current  dry spell isn’t due to pep, but due to the players. We’ve seen for the past decade what pep can do. We’re just unlucky with injuries and having unfit players play. It’s a shame. Absolutely right there and when the transfer window opens Pep will pick the right players but I’m also hoping that he’ll give the Academy guy’s a taste of what it’s like to play for the greatest team that I’ve witnessed from me pram 😅 I have a tough time entirely absolving Pep in our current situation. Why has a fit McAtee been sitting all year given our injury problems? He’s unwilling to lean on academy kids, even in the most dire of circumstances. I get that he’s probably aware of throwing young kids into the deep end of the pool, but I’ll take a healthy academy kid at CB or in midfield if it meant not playing our stars when they’re at like 60% healthy. How is it possible that half speed KDB is better than a fresh James McAtee? Those are all Pep decisions. Now do I think Pep would ever be sacked? No. But that doesn’t mean he’s without fault."
6416,Man City,"He is unsackable. 4 titles in a row in the toughest league in the world is absolutely insane. All the best teams experience a drop off at one point, the fact that most of our fans still think we can win the title is a testament to how great Pep is. "
6417,Man City,"No manager is ""unsackable"" imo.

But Pep is safe.  They're playing on fumes, it's the downside of playing with a small squad. It’s also what’s worked tbh Jamie was right tho , fergie and klopp
Were both unsacksble. As is pep. So there’s 3. Basically we’re taking it on the chin until we get to the January transfer window and can bring in a body or two. City management know it, Pep knows it, the players know it. Without Rodri, or a serviceable CDM out system in greatly flawed. And we can only address that in January. The problem is everyone knows this and CDM is probably the most sought after role in world football. So there simply aren’t any quality ones sitting on the bench somewhere pining for game time. The only one in the world I can see making any sense for City is Kimmich, but there’s no way he just leaves Bayern barring an immense amount of generosity from Vincent Kompany towards his old club. There just aren’t players who know Pep and his system and can uphold his immensely high standards. Pep likes to complain about the hectic schedule, but he could’ve just as easily brought in more depth over the summer. Playing with a thin squad when the calendar is as congested as it is can’t be seen as anything but suicidal. Alleviating the workload for these players is absolutely essential."
6418,Man City,"Crap reporting from ‘experts’. We have lost 5 games, how many titles and trophies have we won… I stopped listening to these clowns years ago… I get better football analysis by the drunken at the pub It's the nature of the media business. When you're the best, people are waiting for anything to dig into. It gets them clicks and views"
6419,Man City,Greatest ever. Unsackable. But we are close to be the greatest ever team too..... tough question.... 
6420,Man City,Why the fuck is this a topic 
6421,Man City,"Why would any club ever sack the best manager in the world? A couple of bad games after year after year of success. Injuries and age are responsible, not Pep. "
6422,Man City,"Okay guys, what formation and lineup against Liverpool will be the best to get a result against them? Surely Pep isn't gonna persist with Gundo, Lewis and Bernado again😭 we need Grealish, KDB and Nunes in the midfield. Doku and Savio on the wings. Unfortunately Lewis isn't any better than Walker at defending.  Nunes a DM? Christ almighty Stones at DM is the best of the options available. If he's fit. 

Walker should never play for City again imo. 

We shouldn't expect to beat Liverpool but imo any chance in the game relies on KDB playing and performing well. 

Gundogan should be benched for Nunes. 

I still expect us to get thumped because the problem isn't just tactical, it's physical, and it's becoming a problem of mentality really quickly. Haaland is playing like he knows he won't receive good service - and he's right tbf. Foden looks a shell of the player he was last season. 

The small squad size just isn't sustainable with this aging squad. We need a couple of January transfers and then a complete rebuild next summer. I seriously read this as, “ok guys, what formation and lineup against liverpool will be the best to get a result to sack Pep” Walker, Gundo out. KDB with captain armband starting and we will be fine"
6423,Man City,It's not even a question. 
6424,Man City,Carragher knows what it takes to be unsackable the spitty cunt.  
6425,Man City,"They been calls for Pep to change his system because it’s clearly not working right but no one not even rivals fans has been calling for his sacking, the media trying to create a narrative where there’s nothing "
6426,Man City,"Pep could literally sub himself in and score an own goal and he would still not be sacked! I dont understand how this is even an discussion?! Every team in the world would die to have pep as their manager. Even Liverpool and arsenal fans deep inside want pep, even if they never gonna admit it… "
6427,Man City,Pep would resign months before sacking even came into thoughts 
6428,Man City,We are the Pep Guardiola team ! 
6429,Man City,"2nd in the league. 4 titles in a row.

The fact this is even being spoken about is fucking hilarious. Desperate Sky Sports. "
6430,Man City,"no, obviously not. we dont wanna be united post fergie now do we. his favouritism this season has already been giving negative results. another 2 years of this, and maybe we wouldnt need the charges to get relegated !  "
6431,Man City,Only way I can see Pep being sacked is if we are near relegation. 
6432,Man City,"The thing is this-if pep finds that the team no longer listens to him, he will resign and leave on his own accord. New contract notwithstanding, it’s up to the players to do their work. "
6433,Man City,He keeps wanting Klopp to be held in the same regard as Pep. Sad really 
6434,Man City,"I find it interesting that almost *no one* in the press is talking about our injury crisis. Every now and then someone says “they have some injuries,” but half the squad is injured. I appreciate that we’re not making excuses, but…how can anyone expect us to perform to our standard when the players’ bodies are pretty beat up right now? Guess that’s the price of being City: everyone expects you to be unbeatable, and when that doesn’t happen, they want it to be because you’re imploding. "
6435,Man City,Yes. 
6436,Man City,Totally agreed with everything he said. 
6437,Man City,"Of course he's unsackable. For now, anyway. He's built up a huge amount of credibility and has to be given the benefit of the doubt for now. Our losses aren't because he's been overtinkering like that CL final, it's because half our squad are broken and the rest are exhausted. And because people don't just say ""there are no easy games"" as a soundbite, it's true. Two of our five losses were to Spurs, that's not that weird.

Sacking Pep now would be insane. Sacking him next year would be almost as insane. If he goes through multiple transfer windows and our perfomances don't improve over the long term then sure, maybe we can consider it. "
6438,Man City,Yes 
6439,Man City,"Play gvardiil in the 6 will help wise words, give this man a job"
6440,Man City,"Unsackable... and our chiefs aren't some bunch of overreactive fools that sack managers left, right, and center for a month of bad results. "
6441,Man City,Why would he be?

6463,Man City,Understood but nonsense like this doesn’t have to be posted on the sub. At least the rags are still shit. 
6464,Man City,"Loool if KDB doesn't start against Liverpool, that's a criminal offense that deserves sacking!😁😅😅 honestly KDB is our only hope against Pool. "
6465,Man City,"I think at the back of my head is Cole Palmer couldn't get a sniff of regular minutes at City, but then when given some latitude to just play at Chelsea he's exploded. I know McAtee was playing at Sheffield the last 2 years, but that should play in his favour, he actually has first team experience. At this point it feels like they kept him, but then he's getting the Kalvin Phillips treatment. "
6466,Man City,"Nope. They would
Never have been sacked. Not saying that a team like Chelsea or

Humble seriously guy is like raging bull , can never forget the hilarious attack on Pep, even Kloppy was amused Obviously a joke"

6470,Man City,something something regression to the mean 
6471,Man City,Obviously a joke

6475,Man City,![gif](giphy|ozjHybAK5ZlOz6n20N|downsized) Remind me which goal he did this for please!!
6476,Man City,"Gvardiol as the striker, Haaland in defense. We will be there. And Ederson in the midfield. Ain't no one gonna bully that man."
6477,Man City,"Didn’t he give this away for charity at the end of that season? Some poor chap is going to get cold

It's for the greater good"

6483,Man City,Remind me which goal he did this for please!! 
6484,Man City,And Ederson in the midfield. Ain't no one gonna bully that man. Ederson as a sweeper will be our saving grace!
6485,Man City,"Some poor chap is going to get cold

It's for the greater good "
6486,Man City,Ederson as a sweeper will be our saving grace! 
6487,Man City,"Yeah I feel bad

He left us to get more game time, and he would've now more than ever as we have a lot of injuries He made exactly the right decision to leave. He's an excellent player at the prime of his career, he doesn't deserve to just be used as a bench option. He wanted to leave to play more, it’s ok, the problem is we not getting a replacement for him. It feels like our attack is playing for Haaland more and more since his arrival and becoming predictable. Ofc Haaland is a monster and can still score improbable goals but when he doesn’t, City loses.

Maybe the plan was Oscar Bobb to replace Alvarez, but then he sadly got injured. We should only look at how we can replace him. Not retrospectively at he how he would have played a lot now But also he's a 9, he played a lot lat season as de Bruyne was injured for a long time as well, but covering at AM and RW isn't is what he does best, and considering his talent, rellying on injuries to play out of position is too little He didn't leave for more game time, he already played the most appearances for us last year. He wanted game time as a #9 and he wasn't going to get that at City with Haaland there. Exactly what happened with Zinchenko. We should be learning not to let so many go for more game time, there's loads of game time to go around. Unfortunately he is not playing well enough and getting benched by another Norwegian striker 😭 he can't catch a break Nah I've seen enough of him trying to play as a midfielder, imagine him and Gundogan 😭😭"
6488,Man City,"That’s right, Alvarez had 20 goal involvements in the Premier League last season even though he didn’t play all the games, he would have been a key player for Guardiola if he had stayed. I think he played in the most games of any city player. Certainly near the top. Alvarez had the 5th most minutes in the Premier League, ahead of Haaland, and most appearances in total."
6489,Man City,I miss him too👍 🥲
6490,Man City,"And some of the fans were like who cares if he leaves,we only need 'Haaland'. Some player's value is only known when they leave and they leave a big gap.This also applies to everything in life. Go hug your parents and be patient with them, you don't know what you'll miss them until they are gone"
6491,Man City,"Let’s be honest lads/lasses, him leaving is not the reason that we’re in this situation. Our problems are all over the pitch, and most notably in midfield. I would argue however that selling him for £80 million and not replacing him was completely ludicrous however. Bit of both. Our front 3 is actually totally devoid of G/A Haaland aside. Gvardiol has the 2nd most goals in the team lol, so yeah Alvarez leaving has defo directly contributed to the situation we’re in, in part 

Pocketing that £80m when we had gaping holes in the squad was an obscene decision the thing is, his pressing and ball recovery did help the midfield and overall defense. those are extra possessions that over the course of a game and season accumulate. he pressed well with Bernardo in particular I remember.

so in reality he helped both offense and defense quite a bit. I don't think he's that easily replaced and it looks like it caught City off guard. 

but when he didn't play much that last month last year they really should have known enough to talk to him and reassure him his place on the team and potential. then you get simeone and the other argentine players all summer in his ear constantly, and that's that, as they say. We saw the cracks last season. And now it broke us. Just need to be patient. Cmon Citeh 💙 Jesus and he both attackers who did the defensive side of things too. Both have not been replaced."
6492,Man City,Just brought this up with a group of friends that he offered us something completely different when things weren't working out. Like the team played differently when he was on cause he was just a completely different player than Haaland. I could go in to detail but I don't want to write a novel lol. You’re right mate. Agree fully
6493,Man City,He would've been a great player in these times. gave city an unpredicitability when he started with haaland or by himself. Yep I agree
6494,Man City,"This guy really kept us going when KDB was injured and again when Haaland was injured

  
Looking forward to Bobb's return. Not sure how soon can Echeverri be integrated into the team Im excited for echeverri, but I agree Hello guys, here is a River Plate fan. 
Since Echeverri's debut I have not missed any River game, I must say that it is not the same one that everyone saw and for which City Group paid. 
He was a big disappointment this year, more was expected of him but he is not physically or mentally fit to compete in the local league. 
I hope that Pep's technical team does magic with him and transforms him into the prospect he seemed to be, but to be honest, they do not get the best version of this player as in the case of Julian who left River being the best in the league, Echeverri is nowhere near that."
6495,Man City,"Family visas were up and he wanted to live in Spain

move on peeps We're also in Spain without the S"
6496,Man City,I have always said and always been downvoted for saying he is a better fit for City as a striker than Erling. 
6497,Man City,"Also I gotta say reading these comments. This doesn't even have to be specifically about alvarez, but more about someone challenging haaland to be better. Right now he can go missing clear chances every game and guess what? He's the lock starter and there's no one to challenge him when he's playing poorly. Of course he's not stopping us from conceding, that's another issue, but no one can argue that he's also helping us score all the time if you've been actually watching these games. 

If you want to be fans who literally only talk about things when it's going the right way, why are you even here? Everything needs to be talked about if you're a fan, good and bad. 100% agree"
6498,Man City,Haaland is a world class player but even world class players need competition from the bench. There are loads of injuries but not having a second striker puts the goal scoring on one player Yep spot on
6499,Man City,"I'm a Real Madrid fan, but I see you guys mention him in the comment section after every single loss, so I'm not sure how he's not talked about enough 😅

Meanwhile, I read Atletico fans online talk about how they regret spending so much money on him. The way I see it, not only was it a great, financial piece of business from Man City, but as a Real Madrid fan, I really can't complain with Atletico's generally poor form, despite having had such an ambitious transfer window. Alvarez has been blowing hot and cold, and as much as I want to see him succeed as a football fan, the Real Madrid fan in me hopes the lack of tangible, consistent quality continues from him as long as he's an Atletico player.

The only mistake Man City made, was not bringing in more depth in the same transfer window. I assume that decision may be related to the allegations that have been raised against you. Being able to rotate players and keep your core from becoming fatigued in a long, league season used to be one of your greatest strengths. I do like Alvarez as a player, but I think a lot of Man City fans are being very opportunistic in looking for scapegoats and quick and easy solutions to the rut you're going through right now. I also recall a small portion of City fans wanting him to replace Haaland in the striker position last season. Then, Haaland got injured and Alvarez played from the start against Newcastle in a cup final loss where I thought Oscar Bobb was the only City player who could leave the pitch with a sense of dignity.

More often than not, it's the collective effort that produces results. It's easy to single out individuals for blame or praise, but it's the collective quality and consistency under Pep that I think stands out as Man City's greatest strength since he became your manager. In terms of individual brilliance, I would fancy our chances against you, but that's largely because our team is set up more to allow for individual players to shine (often at the expense of coherency or strategic play) - which is a strong contrast to how Pep likes to play."
6500,Man City,Facts 
6501,Man City,"I really wanted him to stay, he was my favorite city player. Sadly, they don't give him enough playing time "
6502,Man City,"foden + Alvarez scored 30 goals for city in PL last season, more than 1/3 of the total. This season Foden+missing Alvarez scored 0 so far, and Haaland is the only one scoring goals consistantly, second by Gvardiol‘s 3 goals. Despite losing Rodri and not having a healthy KDB, man city is still the top team in PL to create chances(25.73 xG), second by Hot Spur. But we don't have the spare attackers to turn those oppotunities into goals "
6503,Man City,"Seriously fellow Citizens. Shut the 'fact' up and feel the pain of losing. It puts everything else into context. We won 4 in a row and a treble and you all got spoiled. Cheer for the team we have. Post about the potential of Simpson-Pusey or how you are looking forward to the return of Oscar and spare us the water under the bridge! No matter how much you’re winning,always try to fix things up when something is wrong,don’t just accept those losses

Edit: by “fixing”, I meant discussing what’s wrong While I get what you’re saying about feeling what loss is, our success has been because of good decision making and great personnel in the team. We have to recognize that this team is not enough for what our club wants to be. Trying to understand what is going wrong is the first step to getting good again. While it is necessary to sympathize with the current situation, we should never lose sight of what our club’s ambitions are. Did Pep leave?"
6504,Man City,"We could have signed kyogo from celtic for less than 30 million to replace alvarez’s goals and pressing energy but for some unknown reason best known to pep and txiki, city never pulled the trigger. "
6505,Man City,It was good business and he wanted to leave 
6506,Man City,Leaving for a team that hardly attacks was an awful decision. 
6507,Man City,"I feel like the problem isn't our attack, but our midfield and defense. We should have never allowed four goals to be conceded at home, no matter the state of our attack. "
6508,Man City,Said when he was leaving he will be a great loss. Was roundly hounded about how he wasn't all that. 
6509,Man City,Haaland is a young man. His brain is still that of a young man. Him being our only recognized striker and so a guaranteed start every game is bad for his brain. 
6510,Man City,We would be in the same position with or without him. 
6511,Man City,Yep.  Savinho isn’t near the quality Alvarez was. 
6512,Man City,"Ohhh I tried to talk about it….and how Haaland can only tap balls in!! I got banned from this group!! So moderator how’s ya boy Haaland looking?!

And I’m a City fan all the way, but with lack of creation from mid and up front we  are crumbling "
6513,Man City,"Y'all called me a man when I said Alvarez was better and more complete player than Haaland. Citeh should have never sold him. Can’t believe they called you a man, what an insult."
6514,Man City,"Can someone explain to me why foden can’t play this role?


Recent form is trash but still our best option right? "
6515,Man City,James McAtee was playing a similar role last season in Sheffield. I really hope pep can utilise him from now on. Favourite talent for me 
6516,Man City,"Crazy to say that a striker with no “tech” is a much better #10 than Phil Foden but that’s our reality unfortunately, lost out on his work rate and chance creation (AWFUL corners though). Miss him so much "
6517,Man City,"This amazing lad has won all in football already, world cup, copa libertadores, champions league. "
6518,Man City,"I miss Alvarez alot, the guy would have helped us out so much in our current form. Also wish Mahrez would have stayed and I'd also like the duo of laporte & Dias back, but alas we move on! "
6519,Man City,"Honestly, I’m not sure. There hasn’t been a game this season where I’ve genuinely thought “we’re missing Alvarez here”. We were all crying for him to play Foden in his deeper position last year, yet Pep insisted on Alvarez. This is not to say Alvarez isn’t good, he’s an excellent striker of the ball. But too often he’d go missing as a lone striker, and his first touch is not good enough to play deeper. That being said, we clearly miss his intensity and work ethic, our press drop off wouldn’t have been so bad if he was still here. Watching 2024 Gundogan chase the ball is painful Haven’t you missed him chasing his first touch halfway across the pitch?"
6520,Man City,We should not have sold him. He ran and ran and ran...too easy to say I dont like the weather I'm off!The team is screaming out for Alvarez right now..I'm dreading next Sunday!💩💨💨 
6521,Man City,He’s Doing fuck all at atleti sadly 
6522,Man City,He wouldn’t have stopped us conceding 4 goals on the weekend He probably wouldn’t have. But he would have offered more of a goal threat. Both he and Jesus used to do the defensive shift too.
6523,Man City,Not once during all our problems have I though Hoolian was going to be the one who’d solve them. Give it a rest. 
6524,Man City,We will be ok. Pep is a genius. We will get it right His track record to set things right is impeccable. I’m sure he’ll turn it around. Hopefully sooner than later
6525,Man City,"He made exactly the right decision to leave. He's an excellent player at the prime of his career, he doesn't deserve to just be used as a bench option. That’s true He wasn't a bench option last year. Him and Haaland were on the field at the same time plenty last year. It was that he didn't get to play as striker and was being slotted in more into the midfield and wing. And yet..."
6526,Man City,"He wanted to leave to play more, it’s ok, the problem is we not getting a replacement for him. It feels like our attack is playing for Haaland more and more since his arrival and becoming predictable. Ofc Haaland is a monster and can still score improbable goals but when he doesn’t, City loses.

Maybe the plan was Oscar Bobb to replace Alvarez, but then he sadly got injured. Yeah that's what I was thinking

We need more than one good striker"
6527,Man City,"We should only look at how we can replace him. Not retrospectively at he how he would have played a lot now Yeah I guess 

At least until he's back How would you replace someone like him? \> We should only look at how we can replace him.

6529,Man City,"He didn't leave for more game time, he already played the most appearances for us last year. He wanted game time as a #9 and he wasn't going to get that at City with Haaland there. I think what he wants is more like ""status"" in the team rather than necessarily lack of minutes. He played some big games when Haaland or KdB were not fit, but for the most part if Haaland and KdB were both fit, Alvarez dropped to the bench. He wants to be the guy we rely on as a nailed on starter for big games, not the guy who maybe will play in case of injuries. Haaland, KdB, Rodri for example are all players who will play in every big game if they are fit - they don't need to rely on other players vacating a spot in the starting 11."
6530,Man City,"Exactly what happened with Zinchenko. We should be learning not to let so many go for more game time, there's loads of game time to go around. Yeah we have a different lineup every match now and I feel that Julian would've been playing so much more this season Its inevitable with this model, yall just get a ton of world class players and only a few get a lot of minutes.

6533,Man City,"I think he played in the most games of any city player. Certainly near the top.

6576,Man City,"Echeverri should be loaned to Godoy Cruz. It's where his level deserves right now lol

Lovely league you have in Argentina.  
Greetings from Campo Papa, Godoy Cruz. "
6577,Man City,"followed City through two demotions and a very close play off

this is just a blip Just because we saw the dark times it doesn't mean that these kinds of decisions don't suck."
6578,Man City,"Fans don't fix anything. Fans support. And you certainly don't fix things with players who left. it's okay for fans to discuss why we're losing, i'm sure pep and the team are doing the same thing."
6579,Man City,Definitely not. Then again at least we’d see a bit of pace chasing the ball 😂😂😂😂 good one ngl
6580,Man City,"The thing is, when City's squad is healthy, Juli goes to the bench. In every big CL fixture he went to the bench. Hes not ok with being subbed in for 20min vs Brentford to score the 5 and 6-0. I know his numbers are good but those are decieving and not what he wants. Everyone in argentina is happy that he left. He had the highest PL starts of any player last season for us, and the 5th highest minutes.

I don't think it was about his playtime, or even position, as he isn't the 9 for Atletico either from what I can tell. It was 100% wanting to live in a Spanish speaking country & a more familiar climate & culture."
6581,Man City,"Not to be that person but Alverez was bought before Jesus left, he was on loan at R.Plate but he was still a City player before Jesus was let go. "
6582,Man City,"You are gonna need to start feeding him lots and forcing him to do an intensive pre-season, this season Echeverri started just about every game but he was always subbed out burnt like a piece of toast, he hasnt had a proper pre-season or training session with River because he kept getting snatched by Mascherano to integrate the Olympics team for Argentina. When I read that opening line I thought you meant food, maybe you do, I am not sure now.

What I am saying though is Alverez was an Argentinian wonderkid who was brought in but ended up in Spain. We seem to get stung like this a lot. Aguero being the only one who seemed to have no intention of leaving but I am pretty sure whereever his PC/PS5 is he is happy."
6583,Man City,Just because we saw the dark times it doesn't mean that these kinds of decisions don't suck. 
6584,Man City,"it's okay for fans to discuss why we're losing, i'm sure pep and the team are doing the same thing. This person knows what’s up"
6585,Man City,😂😂😂😂 good one ngl 
6586,Man City,"He had the highest PL starts of any player last season for us, and the 5th highest minutes.

I don't think it was about his playtime, or even position, as he isn't the 9 for Atletico either from what I can tell. It was 100% wanting to live in a Spanish speaking country & a more familiar climate & culture. What he wants is being a core piece of his team, playing the important matches from the start. It can easily be a bit of both, not sure why there's an argument one or the other. He wasn't in Pep's preferred 11 playing a consistent role, he was doing a job and getting a lot of minutes, but he still know that he was holding a place for a fully fit squad. He knows that when players make the effort to get fit for later stages of the CL and Wembley, that he'll be an impact sub. He wants to be the main guy and deserves to be.

We're talking like it's the minutes that matter and it isn't for a player in this position. The difference between playing a lot but not fully knowing where you stand, and knowing you are one of the first names on the teamsheet is massive mentally."

We couldnt score against this at our own ground😭 "
6588,Man City,"Friends I've tried posting the cartoon a few times, has anyone seen it? I'm not sure why it isn't working properly I can see your post mate thank you, it’s as good as ever. Love the Rodri bit."
6589,Man City,"To all you fans around the world. From Asia, Africa, Middle East, Europe, England, Spain, no matter where you are from. When we go to the Anfield, we go there with belief. Belieeeve! "
6590,Man City,"City have never lost a game when I'm wearing the treble home kit. I have decided to take matters into my own hands - Today I am already wearing it guys we've lost way to much and it's time for a change. (We have won every game we played in when I'm in the 2022/23 home kit. Coincidence, I think not. I had not worn it in any of the five previous games mind you). Let's do this !! I have faith

EDIT - gonna have to get rid of the shirt It's for Anfield you'll need it. Actually, burn it."
6591,Man City,"Buy a new midfielder and a defender pls. We straight up need two midfielders. One in the January and another in Summer. And give some of the Academy players some real playing time. McAtee, Wright, Simpson-Pusey can all hold their own, at the least, and they bring some much needed energy and passion—that’s what I think we’re really missing right now."
6592,Man City,"https://preview.redd.it/x63yugrw4a3e1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b029126d97804b03fdc3ec34bf674e588e64f1f

Why don’t any of these lads get a look in? I know Farid has been on the bench once but come on. Our academy has a ridiculous number of attackers Pep doesn't give minutes to MacAtee, Nico and Wright after promoting them and not selling. How do you expect these guys?"
6593,Man City,We are gonna be embarrassed on Sunday. Genuinely could be 6 or 7 nil 
6594,Man City,"Hope you are all doing aok. 

I took Reddit app off my phone, and sheesh now see how much time I was spending here, ha. 

Sure I have missed a lot of great discussions over past few days - look forward to catching up. 

Expecting a win tonight, and *maybe just maybe* 1-2 of the fringe &/or academy players get a few minutes. How comes you re download it? I bet the time out ATM has been blissful"
6595,Man City,Good to see Grealish starting and Dias on the bench! 
6596,Man City,"Ffs Alvarez 

Well we got 95m so there’s that "
6597,Man City,"I'm fine with nunes being our Bernie replacement. Obviously well need a another body, but he can play central and on the wings, has good crossing and high high energy. "
6598,Man City,"its genuinely unbelievable what we are witnessing, im very very amused "
6599,Man City,Sunday gonna be like 5-0 
6600,Man City,"the next win will be in a courtroom 

![gif](giphy|14fyq8TWi8VZn2) "
6601,Man City,It’s time we say goodbye to many players and even of legends of this club. 
6602,Man City,man i really hope we win today…5 is an issue on its own but 6 consecutive losses will be really disappointing 
6603,Man City,what’s everyone’s predicted lineup for today? Whoever isn’t (too) hurt? 😔
6604,Man City,"Bayern PSG and Liverpool Real Madrid today and tomorrow. 

Also, imma be pissed if Sporting lose to Arsenal. They should at least have the decency to beat them too after they beat us Sporting gonna get spanked lol"
6605,Man City,"must win game i feel, gotta get the momentum on our side again "
6606,Man City,"""KDB did the press conference, he will start"" lol! Guilty"
6607,Man City,"Where the fuck has Wilson-Esbrand been? Only recently he’s started to sit on the bench (and I don’t expect him to play a single minute) but why wasn’t he loaned/sold? Did he have an injury? Pretty sure he couldn't find a team from memory, he was at Middlesbrough last season and didn't light things up there. Think he's basically here waiting to be sold"
6608,Man City,Pep with the same formation again🙄🙄 
6609,Man City,Any reason why Pep doesn't try 4-3-3? It will make us less predictable. 
6610,Man City,One of the commentators has just said Dias has been out for 4 months? He’s played this season hasnt he? I know I’m old but I’m sure I’ve seen him be captain? Probably meant 4 weeks
6611,Man City,"We are playing the same way. Not exactly very creative even though still good.


I do feel like some players are half-hearted in their press or defending.


I also feel like Erling is looking frustrated. And not committing himself to run.


I think Gundo is DONE. He is just too slow even in his decision making.


I think Foden is trying in this game but he can be a little less predictable when shooting. Same for Grealish.


Nunes needs to keep it simple. He is a good player but he does come off as erratic.


I think we are still relatively easy to attack. 3 passes and Rico, Bernardo are too shortlegged to stop the outside passes from the keeper to their left back.


I think we are still a good team but we are a little too predictable. "
6612,Man City,The Etihad had become a fucking bouncy castle 
6613,Man City,I feel silly for insisting we were gonna turn it around and rise to the occasion. A couple of injuries should not be causing this collapse. This is top down as much as it is bottom up. Hate to say it but I don't see this freefall ending soon. 
6614,Man City,"Sigh, well glad I decided to come back to Reddit today after a few days away - at least we can all commiserate together 😬😟. "
6615,Man City,Kinda missed feeling shitty about football tbf 
6616,Man City,"After winning two in a row, we had a poor season and failed to win the league. In response, we won four in a row. As it stands this will be another of those poor seasons. Therefore:

2²=4
4²=16 in a row next lads, never fear. "
6617,Man City,When's the last time we didn't win a single game in a whole month? 
6618,Man City,"https://preview.redd.it/ddgxelixlb3e1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6a96b216a75ff52b768fd2bfd8fbd334ad32594

who knows without those 2 gifts by Gvardiol against Spurs how the game would have turned out

same way without those 2 gifts by Gvardiol against Feyenoord we would have got 3 pts

we're clearly not good enough right now but these errors are making life even harder. "
6619,Man City,"*no idea who's fit enough to play...but Walker and Gundogan need to rest*

Ederson

Rico Akanji AKE Gvardiol ~~Simpson-Pusey~~ 

Bernardo GUNDO NUNES ~~KdB O'Reilly~~ 

Foden Haaland Grealish

*This game matters a lot less to me than games in the league... but for our team psychology it sure would be nice to get a win.* I think KdB will be a HUGE addition to the lineup. We need his passion. He was *pissed* when he came on late against Spurs. We need that."
6620,Man City,"Honestly at this point, while I obviously want a win, I want to see our boys play their game and not give up, *ever*. The body language has been so sad to see from so many players, we need to get angry when we concede, and punish our opponents. I’d even settle for a poor performance and a loss if we just see, without a shred of doubt, that our players *want to win*. We may not be able to turn it around tonight, or soon enough to win the league again, but the wins will come IF we can find the passion and relentlessness. the body language when conceding a goal is the most concerning aspect for me... they just give up. where is the leadership?? That pitch on Saturday had 3 members of the leadership group ON THE PITCH. there is NO EXCUSE for everyone to just give up. Walker, Gundo and Bernardo need to do better and get these players to stay focused."
6621,Man City,"Is echeverri good enough to start games for us after January? no Probably more likely than mcatee, but less likely than literally any of our other 8/10s"
6622,Man City,This too shall pass is Peps new favourite saying! In Pep we trust!! 
6623,Man City,That's the UCL done then too Still likely we finish 9-24 and qualify for the playoff round but yeah it's not looking good
6624,Man City,Doesn't even hurt anymore. Predicted a draw before the game started but to condede 3 when we were 3-0 up is something extraordinary. Can't see where we can pick up a win if we're doing this badly against fucking feyernoord 
6625,Man City,"Our defence at Anfield on Sunday

![gif](giphy|sxF8npyn9o2WfnLSzF|downsized) "
6626,Man City,"Great free kick from Alvarez had a rough start but slowly starting to settle in. 8 goals in all comps so far, not enough for a £85m striker but enough to have hope that he can be that player"
6627,Man City,"https://preview.redd.it/ljwb4502jb3e1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ff3cc4249d1bb24cf07db85904b8f0b9f190cde The board hasn't recruited like the past 7 years. That's why. Besides, whoever the journo was, asked him the wrong question and allowed pep to run away. 

He should have asked Pep's choice for subs and favoritism for some players. Pep would have no escape."
6628,Man City,"Would love to know what the Gvardiol fanboys make of this.

Still a top talent but stupidly overrated by people on here. Can’t got 2 minutes without playing a suicide pass. And he’s still better than Walker He's still the only signing I'm actually satisfied with over the past 2 transfer windows.  Someone needs to teach him to make better decisions. He is young and being asked to play as a fullback but he needs to work on basic instincts also. 

Larthargic hospital passes are inexcusable."
6629,Man City,"I can see your post mate thank you, it’s as good as ever. Love the Rodri bit. Hahaha thank you! Glad to see people can see it"
6630,Man City,It's for Anfield you'll need it.

I think his form’s been poor, but given our current state it’s really on full display, no hiding behind wins. Gundo and Bernardo I can still see being big contributors, and their leadership (or lack thereof) is more concerning for me.

This season we have not been the City side that buries opponents who dare score against us. We have been the side that concedes and drops off. That’s unacceptable. Even if we can’t win, we have to get the fight back."
6643,Man City,no

Even if we can’t win, we have to get the fight back. it can't just be Dias rallying the team... the other captains need to. We are missing Rodri there a lot as well... he and Dias are basically the captains even when they don't wear the armband. 

KDB leads by example... but those other 3 are being bad/passive leaders right now. Where is treble captain Gundo??? he needs to make a return."

6664,Man United,"It’s fucking obscene if there's no more costs to be cut then the fans must be rinsed!

fucking ridiculous A kids ticket is now £66. £66 to watch a team that barely scores goals."
6665,Man United,"If this is true it's a fucking joke, tickets are already too expensive as it is. 66 quid is a pisstake though, very worried if this is the way things are going. It is, you can already see it in effect on the website"
6666,Man United,"As someone who occasionally buys a ticket at 1am a week before a match, there is no chance I'm paying £66 for one.

I was planning on picking one up for the Bournemouth match at some point. Definitely not happening now. I'll stick to the cup season ticket games.

Edit: reminder that you can email the club's ticket office at ticketingandmembershipservices@manutd.co.uk. You'll get a nothing response from them I'm sure but the numbers will get passed along to management. Also, remember that the poor staff reading and responding aren't making those decisions. They don't care about us, for all the lip service they give about fans. They are total idiots who can't see past the short-term profits they think they can generate I’ve emailed too, no point in moaning on here if no one acts on it."
6667,Man United,"As a season ticket holder I can sell my ticket back to the club.


FV is £40. If I sell it that's what I get.


But now you pay £66 pounds for that ticket and the club is going to pocket the difference? 


Fuck off. And if nobody buys it, you'll get marked as non-attendance. Don't worry, FV probably will be more than that next year..."
6668,Man United,"So finally, we the loyal fans get fucked for years of mismanagement and waste by the fo fucking Glazers and their idiotic mole Woodward and others, shameful I mean yeah. Decade and a half of horrible mismanagement and still paying glazer dividends gets you this. We’re broke and we need to fix it or the sponsorship deals go as well"
6669,Man United,"Outrageous. Raising ticket prices is one of the worst things they could do to get fans on their back. 

I wonder if this is to try and stop being refunding them and making no money off having to find a new buyer. I did think the refund option for ST holders was extremely generous, being able to just get your full-price money back for less glamorous games, only for the tickets to just be resold for the same value. They don't get sold for the same value, tickets have been £5 more expensive than the ST equivalent."
6670,Man United,"Incoming top reds and people from abroad with decent salaries who'd pay £1000 for one off ticket to tell us how it's a good thing and that we are lucky because ""U.S. prices are XYZ/It's a business etc. etc."" Ignore the Americans, they have literally no concept of how ticket prices are supposed to work because they’ve been indoctrinated by this system their entire lives. Yeah american/canadian ticket to sporting events are mental. The cheapest Raptors NBA ticket is like 66 pounds. Its an absolute disgrace that any resonable ticket cost north of 100 pounds. Its the reason I never really go to sporting events."
6671,Man United,"Yeah they've changed the ticketing page to say this. If anyone's not willing to be rinsed for money and wants to go to a game soon, Bodo/Glimt (very short notice I know) and Rangers tickets are still available for £43 and £40 minimum for each game. (No membership required). I've been going to EL matches in the nosebloods, absolutely no way I'm going to pay minimum £66 for a Thursday night match "
6672,Man United,Milk me dry Sir Jim That brexit loving tax avoiding chelsea season ticket holder rat will definitely fo that than dip into his own pockets. I don’t think this is on ineos ? AFAIK they’re only dealing with the sporting side ; and as they’re minority shareholders they don’t have much to say on other sides.
6673,Man United,The Glazers bringing in the Grim Reaper to do their dirty work! 💀 
6674,Man United,A disgrace. 
6675,Man United,"Disgraceful from the club, we’ve stuck by this shitshow for the last 10 years and have been fiercely loyal to the team and now we’re repaid by possibly being price out of going to games.

Doesn’t feel like my club sometimes. "
6676,Man United,Absolute disgrace! 
6677,Man United,Jesus this is grim. 
6678,Man United,"Where are the muppets that defended INEOS in the past because they cut negligible costs? 

66 per game is ridiculous. They'll be mostly hiding like the rats they are"
6679,Man United,"There would be an outcry if this happened when it was solely the Glazers. I'm hoping for the same response from fans regardless of INEOS - they haven't built up enough good will to be making decisions like this. 

We are closer to the bottom of the table than we are to the top and in a rebuilding stage where expectations for performances and winning are low. Disgusting corporate decision from a club that's quickly losing what was left of its soul. "
6680,Man United,"Fucking joke!

I was so excited when I’ve managed to snatch tonight two tickets (one for me and one for my 6 years old son) for Everton game this Sunday…just to find out that they expect me to pay 132 gbp for a pair…I thought it was a glitch, surely 6 years old ticket won’t be 66 quid…and here we are!!

Disgusting and disgraceful!

6681,Man United,"Best believe when the new stadium is built, ticket prices would be unaffordable for the everyday Joe. Oh definitely. I think easily £80 a ticket going onto like £200. Nother to mention a loan will be taken out to finance the stadium"
6682,Man United,"Genuinely the sort of thing I'd consider walking away from this club (and thereby this sport) for. Absolutely disgusting, pathetic, embarrassing bunch of fucking rats. Don't think we won't come after this new mob as well as the Glazers.

Think this is a fair enough statement from MUST who are clearly finding out as we all are but really strong action is needed on this. "
6683,Man United,"I didn't even pay £66 a ticket for our CL run in '08 and the price crept up each round we went through.

Unfortunately, the end is neigh for the everyday football fan I fear. "
6684,Man United,"as someone who goes regularly and isn’t a season ticket holder, this is awful news. That’s an extra £14-£26 per game.

I love the diversity and mix of cultures during match day, but there’s already too many wannabe “tik-tokers” and people going purely for content. This is pricing out a lot of local fans, especially kids, and we’re going to become just like the London tourists clubs.

Edit: who’s gonna want to pay £66 to see Zirkzee play anyway? "
6685,Man United,"Sir Jim wants to make us profitable by all means and is leaving no stone unturned to do so. Finally, he comes round to fuck us loyal fans.  that's the part he doesnt understand. It's a football club not a car factory. It doesnt have to make profit. SJR knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing"
6686,Man United,Going full oasis 
6687,Man United,Is it April 1st? 
6688,Man United,I’m guessing we don’t get that much if we sell our tickets back to the club going forward though 
6689,Man United,Do they not understand that the fans can’t afford that? They don't care about those fans.
6690,Man United,"As the MUST statement rightly points out, we’ve been crap- is putting ticket prices up the move in the circumstances?

Sure, you’ll get fans taking the remaining 3% of tickets left as there’ll be some just wanting to go for the experience of it, but the bubble will eventually burst when it comes to prices. "
6691,Man United,"Disgusting. If the PSR concerns are real, then maybe you should run the club better, rather than just fuck up the fans. "
6692,Man United,I mean it’s been obvious that INEOS want to run the club like a business rather than a football club. Hilarious that we have billionaires who ‘love the club’ rinsing the fans rather than spending their own cash. Embarrassing. The players should pick up the bill if the club won’t 
6693,Man United,What a fuckin joke 
6694,Man United,Time to act. INEOS OUT! 
6695,Man United,"Hope none of you put the protest banners and the flares away because it seems we may need them for this lot as well.

Absolutely ridiculous, boneheaded decision during a season when we've seen more staffing changes than goals. "
6696,Man United,"Crazy how they feel the need to do shit like this but the club signs off on Antony getting 200k a week or new contracts with pay increases of tens of thousands of pounds like they’re wiping their ass. Crazy really. How in one department that money is pocket change to them. I mean, one less dumb signing would've paid for this nonsense 5 or 6 times over. "
6697,Man United,Get the Brit in as part owner they said he’ll look after us they said LOL 
6698,Man United,"if there's no more costs to be cut then the fans must be rinsed!

fucking ridiculous "
6699,Man United,A kids ticket is now £66. £66 to watch a team that barely scores goals. 
6700,Man United,"It is, you can already see it in effect on the website Fuck sake, might not go unless they roll this back"
6701,Man United,"They don't care about us, for all the lip service they give about fans. They are total idiots who can't see past the short-term profits they think they can generate Yep. I've pinged an email to the ticket office. That's about all I can do. Don't envy the staff managing the inbox in the morning."
6702,Man United,"I’ve emailed too, no point in moaning on here if no one acts on it. "
6703,Man United,"And if nobody buys it, you'll get marked as non-attendance. Don't worry, FV probably will be more than that next year... "
6704,Man United,I mean yeah. Decade and a half of horrible mismanagement and still paying glazer dividends gets you this. We’re broke and we need to fix it or the sponsorship deals go as well 
6705,Man United,"They don't get sold for the same value, tickets have been £5 more expensive than the ST equivalent. No I meant I get the same value back when I refund. And that means the club make £0 for having a ticket they thought was sold, back on sale £5 for having to find a buyer which isn't guaranteed for low-stakes games...Probably racked the prices up knowing some people will pay it and it'll make up for some empty seats"
6706,Man United,"Ignore the Americans, they have literally no concept of how ticket prices are supposed to work because they’ve been indoctrinated by this system their entire lives. We have a US office and a colleague from there told me she bought her and her dad's tickets to the super bowl (through the club) a few years ago and it was something like 6000 dollars just for tickets. Absolutely crazy"
6707,Man United,Yeah american/canadian ticket to sporting events are mental. The cheapest Raptors NBA ticket is like 66 pounds. Its an absolute disgrace that any resonable ticket cost north of 100 pounds. Its the reason I never really go to sporting events. 
6708,Man United,"I've been going to EL matches in the nosebloods, absolutely no way I'm going to pay minimum £66 for a Thursday night match  The (other) shit thing is somebody will pay for altitude sickness with jarring leg room vs Ferencvaros in February regardless.

Hopefully MUST and other fan groups campaign hard against this."
6709,Man United,That brexit loving tax avoiding chelsea season ticket holder rat will definitely fo that than dip into his own pockets. 
6710,Man United,"I don’t think this is on ineos ? AFAIK they’re only dealing with the sporting side ; and as they’re minority shareholders they don’t have much to say on other sides. There would have been a brief about how INEOS opposed this if they actually bothered. 

INEOS are Glazers in disguise."
6711,Man United,They'll be mostly hiding like the rats they are 
6712,Man United,Oh definitely. I think easily £80 a ticket going onto like £200. Nother to mention a loan will be taken out to finance the stadium 
6713,Man United,"that's the part he doesnt understand. It's a football club not a car factory. It doesnt have to make profit. SJR knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing It’s pushing the loyalty of some fans to the absolute limit. I’d argue that fans aren’t getting value for money on their ticket prices even before the increase.

Give me something worth watching before hiking the prices up!"
6714,Man United,They don't care about those fans. 
6715,Man United,"Fuck sake, might not go unless they roll this back "
6716,Man United,Yep. I've pinged an email to the ticket office. That's about all I can do. Don't envy the staff managing the inbox in the morning. 
6717,Man United,"No I meant I get the same value back when I refund. And that means the club make £0 for having a ticket they thought was sold, back on sale £5 for having to find a buyer which isn't guaranteed for low-stakes games...Probably racked the prices up knowing some people will pay it and it'll make up for some empty seats "
6718,Man United,We have a US office and a colleague from there told me she bought her and her dad's tickets to the super bowl (through the club) a few years ago and it was something like 6000 dollars just for tickets. Absolutely crazy That's genuinely mental
6719,Man United,"The (other) shit thing is somebody will pay for altitude sickness with jarring leg room vs Ferencvaros in February regardless.

Hopefully MUST and other fan groups campaign hard against this. "
6720,Man United,"There would have been a brief about how INEOS opposed this if they actually bothered. 

INEOS are Glazers in disguise. "
6721,Man United,"It’s pushing the loyalty of some fans to the absolute limit. I’d argue that fans aren’t getting value for money on their ticket prices even before the increase.

Give me something worth watching before hiking the prices up! I'd really hope there's some kind of protest. Honestly, INEOS have talked a great game but their actions in running the club really are just a different shade of billionaire shit."
6722,Man United,That's genuinely mental 
6723,Man United,"I'd really hope there's some kind of protest. Honestly, INEOS have talked a great game but their actions in running the club really are just a different shade of billionaire shit. "
6724,Man United,"What tier this dude? Cause I see daily mail and don't believe He seems to be one of those guys who puts out a constant stream of United stories, with pretty mixed veracity. Chris is tier 2 here He’s very close to someone in Ineos, got a lot of info from them pre takeover. Yeah but this story is essentially ‘good player liked by club’ tiers aren’t exactly helpful"
6725,Man United,"**From the article:**



**- Manchester United have scouts at Sporting Lisbon’s Champions League clash with Arsenal on what will be another big night for Viktor Gyokeres.**



\- **United have made signing a centre-forward their priority,** although Amorim has promised not to raid his old club in January when money will be particularly tight anyway.



\- **Left-back Nuno Mendes could be an option,** having played under him at Sporting before moving to Paris Saint-Germain. The 22-year-year-old shares the same agent as Bruno Fernandes.



\- Confidential revealed earlier this month that **Sporting forwards Geovany Quenda and Pedro Goncalves could be long-term targets in addition to Gyokeres.**



**Also:**



\- Star academy striker Chido Obi-Martin will toast his 17th birthday on Friday with the announcement that he has been upgraded to a professional contract.



\- Godwill Kukonki’s inclusion in the travelling party to Ipswich was the 16-year-old defender’s reward for impressing Ruben Amorim in training.



\- The youngster has really caught the eye of Amorim and his coaches so instead of being included with the Under 19s group that travelled to the Netherlands for the first leg of a UEFA Youth League qualifier against AZ Alkmaar, Kukonki was held back to continue working with the first team.



\- An independent survey has revealed that 55 per cent of United fans would prefer a new stadium over redeveloping Old Trafford – but not if ticket prices are used to fund it.



\- Fan Coalition 58 launched their own survey after raising concerns over the club-led poll of supporters. The group had claimed ‘soundbites and comments regarding demographics’ in the results released by United earlier this month ‘raised eyebrows to say the least’.



\- With 6,500 Bodo/Glimt supporters descending on Manchester this week, plans are afoot for them to host a pre-match party at the popular Freight Island venue.



\- new analyst Eduardo Rosalino was also on duty at Portman Road having become the last remaining member of Amorim’s coaching team to be granted a work permit. Kukonki's fucking massive!

Amorim clearly eyeing him up for that LCB role long term, would be huge if we didn't have to sign someone like Brainthwaite and could spend the money elsewhere. Really like Nuno Mendes, not sure if PSG like the idea of selling him though."
6726,Man United,"For all the comparisons with ETH, Gyokores is an obviously world-class player in a position we need. Ok the transform of Ajax to Sporting has now initiated… Agreed. The man bags goals for fun, is a physical specimen, and he understands EXACTLY how Ruben wants him to play in that formation. On top of that if we don’t sign him another premier team likely will Amorim also gets to work with an actual board, not Woodward. I’d also say in ETH’s defence, that before Spurs said they wouldn’t negotiate with us, ETH’s preference was going all out for Kane and keeping DDG over signing two previous players in Onana and Mount. How do we know he’s world class and not like Bas Dost? Genuine question, I know which way I lean but I need someone to say here’s why I think he’s of genuine scalable world class talent and Bas Dost was not. World class player since the last 2 seasons? Here we go again throwing that word around. If we really believe he is  the best in class sure go for it. I wouldn't even mind going for him as long as its nit going to be silly money being thrown around. How is that a position we need when we signed 3 young strikers in the last 2 seasons? 2 of which are quite expensive and the other being Obi Martin How do u define world class? He played for Coventry and sporting Lisbon? Yet I can see our wingers not servicing him. If we get him, Ruben needs to go Sir Alex with RVP ""if you don't pass to him, you don't play"""
6727,Man United,"Hard to believe this one, he's only managed one game. I think every club in Europe would be scouting the top scoring striker in Europe right now, and Sporting in general."
6728,Man United,"We cooked eth for doing exactly this tho There’s also a bunch of people like myself who didn’t care at all. Tbf Gyokeres is the hottest striker on the planet and Quenda is wanted by literally every top club. Unavoidable that we'd be linked imo. And if Amorims signings are as bad as Ten Hag's were, he'll eventually get the same treatment. I don’t really believe this report, but I think a lot of people often expect the manager to rinse their former team of talent, but it rarely happens. 

I also don’t think many people questioned Ten Hag wanting former players like Antony, Timber, Martinez or even de Jong in his first summer window. But when the manager is still spending a lot of time looking at his former players in summer window #3, I think we were right to be concerned and criticize it. 

If we’re 600 million deep, playing like shit, and Amorim is still spending a lot of time looking at his former players by his third season…we’ll “cook” him too. At least Gyokeres makes some sense with how many goals he’s scoring and how badly we need a goal scorer Did any of the players from ETH score 43 goals in one season and 24 in 19 the season after? Zirkzee ain’t it and hojlund is too young, I say bring him on Yeah but it was the fact they weren't always good choices and that there were so many. 

Gyokeres is the most in form striker in Europe this year. The difference is that Gyokeres is the top scorer across all tournaments The problem wasn’t with him bringing in Ajax players. The problem was paying horriric prices for Championship level players like Antony. Gyökeres is a different beast. But we all collectively love Licha and are glad he's here. Also Onana is great imo. Hit and miss but I'm OK with it. Also, it would surely have to be in the summer and we need to offload some players first."
6729,Man United,We aren't buying anyone in January anyway 
6730,Man United,"People comparing this to ETH I can’t get behind purely because Erik bought players and proceeded to say we aren’t going to play like I coached at Ajax.

Ruben’s buying players for his system, that know his system, and we know we are playing that system as evidenced on his very first fucking game.

I’m all for Ruben personally, so glad ETH is gone - that dude just bought anyone he worked with and had no fucking clue. Remindme! 6 months"
6731,Man United,The FDJ saga still haunts me fam 
6732,Man United,"Of the 4 players that have moved from Lisbon in the past, I have loved all 4.

Ronaldo, Nani, Rojo, Fernandes. "
6733,Man United,"Only way can see us get money for him, is if we sell rashford... Something I'm not against "
6734,Man United,"Doesn't this club have any reputable scouts? Why keep going back to the same manager specific clubs again and again and paying over the top for players. It’s infuriating, it’s like it’s a monday night 5-a-side and they’ve asked Amorim, “got any mates that can play for us?”. So amateur, particularly given how well it worked with ETH… Tbf, even if EtH was still here we would be linked with him. It's a position of need and he's going to move in the summer."
6735,Man United,Seems to have really taken a shine to Kukonki. 
6736,Man United,No one gonna pass him shit. Get some new midfielders please. 
6737,Man United,What’s the point in going after Goncalves when we have Bruno? Bruno just turned 30 years old so maybe they are looking to the future. In 3 years he will be 33. Goncalves is like 26 so not super young I think may be wise looking at someone around 23-24. Either way I don’t think it’s a bad option
6738,Man United,Sporting Ajax Utd 
6739,Man United,KOM TILL UNITED VIKTOR 
6740,Man United,"Amorim literally said that he would not try to buy him in January. Full stop. So, I guess this is for summer? "
6741,Man United,Yes...get a striker who can hit the back of the net. 
6742,Man United,"Am I the only one who thinks Hojlund deserves more time to grow. Haaland and Bellingham wouldn't be what they are today if they came to United and played second fiddle to someone else, instead of getting regular first-team minutes at Dortmund. Don't want that to happen to Rasmus. "
6743,Man United,https://preview.redd.it/sb9fwlraka3e1.png?width=150&format=png&auto=webp&s=1404e823c845f63dfe2461b65d92a787e938507f 
6744,Man United,"The Daily Mail. Yeah, ok. "
6745,Man United,Lazy journalism. Ex-manager of Sporting wants player from Sporting. 
6746,Man United,"The worrying thing for me is that this feels like standing operating procedure for us in the post-fergie era. Bring in a manager, supply him with “his players”, and then when we underperform for whatever reason and the manager is sacked, we’re left with players that don’t fit the vision of the next manager, and the cycle repeats.

I thought this was this intention behind hiring Berrada and Ashworth and Wilcox. Acquiring players that would fit well together and then hiring the manager to compliment the skill sets of the squad. Maybe that’s still how it will transpire, but it just feels very old hat when we continue our squad rebuilding by targeting players who were only just under the employ of our manager. "
6747,Man United,Come on lads. This is from Mail Online. Site is not to be trusted. 
6748,Man United,Exiting. But I really want Højlund to succed. 
6749,Man United,obviously would love Gyorkeres but I do get worried if Amorim is allowed to target so many of his former players. I am hoping Ineos will have a more robust search for new players than that. 
6750,Man United,Didn't Gyo said he does not want to go to club like United? 
6751,Man United,"Sporting team would finish 10th in the PL

I hope thus isn't ajax all over again "
6752,Man United,Didn't we just do this with ETH. 
6753,Man United,"Boy, some united fans are not going to be happy with this news "
6754,Man United,![gif](giphy|XITw5fjtXDABx42LYh) 
6755,Man United,"This isn’t news worthy, this is like saying a “human needs air to breathe after waking up.” Any and every team is going to be looking into Viktor. Especially if your old coach moved to Manchester. "
6756,Man United,Because bringing your last team’s players worked so well with Ten Hag 
6757,Man United,Isn’t Nuno Mendes close to a contract renewal with PSG? 
6758,Man United,"Ferguson would be cheap loan if the rumors are true. Not bad to see how he does Jan-May? I dont think we would be able to get Gyokeres in January What does Ferguson provide that's not already on the team and under contract?  Just play Rasmus. Why would we get another young,  inexperienced striker?"
6759,Man United,🤣🤣. Dudes been in a week.  Absolute garbage. 
6760,Man United,"Given other news around our budget availability in Jan, the odds of this happening are 0. I’d be thrilled to be wrong. "
6761,Man United,"I think Gyokeres will not shine with this group of players. He is physical specimen and knows how to play in Amorim System, but he is not technically gifted player. With this group of players, he won’t get any support, our current players are not able to play good football, don’t have techniques, Gyokeres will be running alone like a fool in the front. Unless we also bring in 2-3 players, who can pass the ball in final third, creating chances & killer passes, can keep the ball and know when to advance the ball "
6762,Man United,"Likely the summer. We have 0 budget from whatever we hear and Amorim said he didn’t want to take any Sporting players this January, and it would be really shitty for him to do so otherwise. Having another LB would be the priority.

I would think maybe the midfield but have Ugarte,  Mainoo, Bruno and Mount, as well as Case and Eriksen who are still good players, so maybe look to the summer to add squad depth. "
6763,Man United,"Hope we bring him in next summer. As things stand, Rasmus and ZZ are pants. "
6764,Man United,"Ah fuck. He’s going to ruin his career signing for us. Graveyard FC. Don’t do it lad, stay away!! "
6765,Man United,Not this shit again 
6766,Man United,Get it done. 
6767,Man United,If we are buying Gyokresh try selling Hoylund and Zirkzee too. Agreed.
6768,Man United,"CMs should be the priority in the summer, we haven't got the legs outside of Ugarte for Amorims role. "
6769,Man United,This isn’t good. We either have hired a manager to match the style of football that WE want to play and buy players for that system or we continue what we did under ten Hag and let him buy who he wants. 
6770,Man United,"Oh dear god! Here we go again. Have we learnt anything from ETH era? Clearly we haven't learned to not believe all the shite we read Yeah! I hate signing *checks notes* strikers who score lots of goals in the system the new manager is trying to implement. I mean, are you nuts? This guy is in the best form in all of Europe 😂 doing it against the best in UCL too. Making this about ten hag is incredible"
6771,Man United,"if this is true, Zirkzee will be leaving then "
6772,Man United,"He seems to be one of those guys who puts out a constant stream of United stories, with pretty mixed veracity. Ah so Tier - Broken clock"
6773,Man United,"Chris is tier 2 here I think he should be moved back down to 3. If not for his scatter gun approach to releasing information, the daily mail’s editorial practices are so poor. A lot of enragement bait mixed in with news. But i’m sure someone who has followed closer than i will be able to say if i’m right or wrong in the winter review.  That is extremely surprising."
6774,Man United,"He’s very close to someone in Ineos, got a lot of info from them pre takeover. "
6775,Man United,Yeah but this story is essentially ‘good player liked by club’ tiers aren’t exactly helpful 
6776,Man United,"Kukonki's fucking massive!

Amorim clearly eyeing him up for that LCB role long term, would be huge if we didn't have to sign someone like Brainthwaite and could spend the money elsewhere. Ideal world - Kukonki and Amass nail down the left hand side for us."
6777,Man United,"Really like Nuno Mendes, not sure if PSG like the idea of selling him though. "
6778,Man United,Ok the transform of Ajax to Sporting has now initiated… Yeah lol. Sporting is the new Ajax 😂
6779,Man United,"Agreed. The man bags goals for fun, is a physical specimen, and he understands EXACTLY how Ruben wants him to play in that formation. On top of that if we don’t sign him another premier team likely will This could be one of those signings where he goes to somewhere like Liverpool or Arsenal and starts scoring 30 per year and everyone is like “how did United let this guy go their rivals when the link to Amorim was already there??”

If this story is just a rumor then fine, but it makes too much sense for it not to happen. Allows Højlund to grow and then they could become an incredible 1-2 punch for the next 5-6 years."
6780,Man United,"Amorim also gets to work with an actual board, not Woodward. Ten Hag didn’t deal with Woodward either, he’d left by the time he’d arrived."
6781,Man United,"I’d also say in ETH’s defence, that before Spurs said they wouldn’t negotiate with us, ETH’s preference was going all out for Kane and keeping DDG over signing two previous players in Onana and Mount. How did not signing kane have anything to do with getting mount and onana? Not signing kane lead to us getting hojlund who never played under ten hag Source for this? That’s absolutely false mate. The board wanted to keep DDG, in fact the contract terms was already agreed but that’s ETH that pulled out last minute and said he didn’t want him anymore."
6782,Man United,"How do we know he’s world class and not like Bas Dost? Genuine question, I know which way I lean but I need someone to say here’s why I think he’s of genuine scalable world class talent and Bas Dost was not. There's absolutely no way of knowing until he comes in. This is true for like 99% of transfers. maybe a handful of players you can argue are that good they could cut it in any system or league. Turn on their game right now and just watch his movement off the ball. He literally is always popping up in space and you keeo asking yourself why hes always wide open. He can also finish with both feet and his head. He's going to destroy the prem for someone next season."
6783,Man United,World class player since the last 2 seasons? Here we go again throwing that word around. If we really believe he is  the best in class sure go for it. I wouldn't even mind going for him as long as its nit going to be silly money being thrown around. Yeah. He may be a great player but we have no idea how he'll do in a top 5 league. He didn't even really impress in the Championship and that was only 2 years ago. He seems pretty special but yeah i thought the focus is shifting towards getting players before they reach this level. Like if we took a punt on Gyokeres 18-24 months ago.
6784,Man United,How is that a position we need when we signed 3 young strikers in the last 2 seasons? 2 of which are quite expensive and the other being Obi Martin 
6785,Man United,How do u define world class? He played for Coventry and sporting Lisbon? As in being one of the best strikers in the world.
6786,Man United,"Yet I can see our wingers not servicing him. If we get him, Ruben needs to go Sir Alex with RVP ""if you don't pass to him, you don't play"" "
6787,Man United,"I think every club in Europe would be scouting the top scoring striker in Europe right now, and Sporting in general. But what are the scouts looking for?

We have the manager who got him firing like this and he looks to implement the same system. 

""Would this guy who is the top scorer across the top 5 leagues be a good fit for the manager who managed him for the past seasons? Let's send our scouts to find out"".

Kind of like... How much did Bayern need to scout Harry Kane and how much can you just like.. watch the games on TV and see that yes, he's scoring for fun?"
6788,Man United,"There’s also a bunch of people like myself who didn’t care at all. Add me to the list. If they play well, then I don’t care how much they cost or who we bought them from. *Sadly, they didn’t.* Noone would have cared if he got results.

The issue was threefold, he brought in so many former Ajax players, whilst saying we're never going to play like Ajax and then settling on a catastrophic basketball like playstyle where we had zero control most games.

Amorim has already fully committed to the 343 playstyle he knows. Bringing in players like Gyokeres who not only know that playstyle inside out but are also at the very top of what is attainable for us in the market in terms of quality makes sense. 

Of course the negotiation team will have to do better than the previous regime as well to manage perception. If we spend 85m on someone who isn't even outstanding at Sporting like we did with Antony, theres obviously going to be criticism."
6789,Man United,Tbf Gyokeres is the hottest striker on the planet and Quenda is wanted by literally every top club. Unavoidable that we'd be linked imo. 
6790,Man United,"And if Amorims signings are as bad as Ten Hag's were, he'll eventually get the same treatment. ETH only had like one or two bad signings though Given his job title is head coach and there is meant to be a while structure above him for doing transfers then no he shouldn't, juts like ten hagg shouldn't have been for the price of any of the signings under him as that also wasn't his job but sure people love to rant "
6791,Man United,"I don’t really believe this report, but I think a lot of people often expect the manager to rinse their former team of talent, but it rarely happens. 

I also don’t think many people questioned Ten Hag wanting former players like Antony, Timber, Martinez or even de Jong in his first summer window. But when the manager is still spending a lot of time looking at his former players in summer window #3, I think we were right to be concerned and criticize it. 

If we’re 600 million deep, playing like shit, and Amorim is still spending a lot of time looking at his former players by his third season…we’ll “cook” him too. "

6798,Man United,antony is not gyokeres 
6799,Man United,"Ten Hag’s issue wasn’t recruitment. Ten Hag ran into the issue all United managers do; you’re met with expectations that currently can’t be met so you don’t have the luxury of deconstructing what’s currently there. 

You don’t have the luxury of getting worse before you get better because of pressure from the media and the fans. Ten Hag abandoned playing out of the back after three games in his first season.

What makes me so optimistic about Amorim is that he absolutely won’t ditch his philosophy. He’s going to face a lot of scrutiny but I believe on top of the tactical know-how, he has the composure to tough it out and we’ll be better for it. Bagn on. One step forwards and two steps back has been the story since Fergie. Hopefully Amorim and Ineos have the nerve to do the opposite this time. His issue absolutely was the recruitment imo. That first summer transfer window apart from licha and eriksen set us back. Had he signed a better 100m winger, maybe we would have fared better in his injury-ridden second season."
6800,Man United,I feel like 90% of these are just easy clicks for the media. 
6801,Man United,We absolutely should not start raiding his old clubs. These managers need to have confidence that they’ve developed players before so why not get players with a higher base level and develop them 
6802,Man United,If We get Gyökeres we should he very thankful. He is exactly the player I want for United. 
6803,Man United,"Are you not aware how good Gyokeres is? Of fucking course we're going to be linked with him, as we should be. It's a foregone conclusion he's making a big move this summer already. "
6804,Man United,Buying players from Sporting never seems to miss though. 
6805,Man United,Yep - someone needs to tell them that Holland and Portugal are NOT the premier league.  
6806,Man United,"ETH got cooked for overpaying Ajax or other clubs for former Ajax/Eredevise players that weren’t that good. Doubling Antony’s price to get him in the door being the huge example. 

Signing Gyokeres wouldn’t really fall in that because he’s probably the hottest striker to sign in Europe. 

Anyone else would depend on the price. If we overpay for a bunch of sporting players yeah that is an issue, but I don’t see that happening with INEOS/Ashworth. Amorim is going to need players that can slot into this system quickly and sporting are in a position consistently where they have to sell players to stay financially viable so even if we went to them for a host of players it shouldn’t be what happened under ETH.

6809,Man United,"It’s infuriating, it’s like it’s a monday night 5-a-side and they’ve asked Amorim, “got any mates that can play for us?”. So amateur, particularly given how well it worked with ETH… "
6810,Man United,"Tbf, even if EtH was still here we would be linked with him. It's a position of need and he's going to move in the summer. "
6811,Man United,Bruno just turned 30 years old so maybe they are looking to the future. In 3 years he will be 33. Goncalves is like 26 so not super young I think may be wise looking at someone around 23-24. Either way I don’t think it’s a bad option Goncalves isn’t that young either. Bruno is 33 then Goncalves will be almost 30. If we are gonna replace Bruno then it should be someone like Xavi Simmons
6812,Man United,What does Ferguson provide that's not already on the team and under contract?  Just play Rasmus. 
6813,Man United,"Why would we get another young,  inexperienced striker? "
6814,Man United,Agreed. 
6815,Man United,Clearly we haven't learned to not believe all the shite we read 
6816,Man United,Yeah! I hate signing *checks notes* strikers who score lots of goals in the system the new manager is trying to implement. Wouldn't he cost a fortune? How can we even afford gyokeres with our ffp situation?
6817,Man United,"I mean, are you nuts? This guy is in the best form in all of Europe 😂 doing it against the best in UCL too. Making this about ten hag is incredible "
6818,Man United,"Ah so Tier - Broken clock Lmfao, mods should really make that flair for tiers 😂 Exactly"
6819,Man United,"I think he should be moved back down to 3. If not for his scatter gun approach to releasing information, the daily mail’s editorial practices are so poor. A lot of enragement bait mixed in with news. But i’m sure someone who has followed closer than i will be able to say if i’m right or wrong in the winter review.  Got Fabrizio at tier 3 and this guy from Daily Mail at 2. This sub is not reliable."
6820,Man United,That is extremely surprising. 
6821,Man United,Ideal world - Kukonki and Amass nail down the left hand side for us. 
6822,Man United,"Yeah lol. Sporting is the new Ajax 😂 Friendship ended with Ajax. Now Sporting is my best friend.

6823,Man United,"This could be one of those signings where he goes to somewhere like Liverpool or Arsenal and starts scoring 30 per year and everyone is like “how did United let this guy go their rivals when the link to Amorim was already there??”

If this story is just a rumor then fine, but it makes too much sense for it not to happen. Allows Højlund to grow and then they could become an incredible 1-2 punch for the next 5-6 years. God yeah you’re right. Salah will go and Gyokeres will fill his void for the next 5-6 years."
6824,Man United,"Crazy how Hojlund is now no longer the youngest Danish striker at our club. He is, however, still the youngest Rasmus at our club"
6825,Man United,"Can’t wait to see the day he scores a goal against Arsenal 😂 chanting 'he's one of our own' as he bangs a hattrick at the emirates That will be sweet but when he brings his u15 form to senior football and bangs in 9 against the scousers, that’s what I’m looking forward to In a week? .. and the little boy inside him screams - MAN UTD!"
6826,Man United,"**From the article:**

**Denmark's probably greatest football talent can call himself a professional football player from Friday,** and with that Manchester United will have to go into the pockets.

**Chido Obi-Martin turns 17 on Friday, and in England you have to be 17 before you can sign a professional contract with a club.**

For the first few months, the Danish striker has played for Manchester United on a so-called ""scholarship"", **but on his birthday, Chido Obi-Martin signs a professional contact with the English big club.**

**Manchester United confirms this to Tipsbladet.** > Denmark's probably greatest football talent 

So he might make a job doing this, I take it..."
6827,Man United,Our own Haland? Stay humble though https://preview.redd.it/od28wh7wq83e1.jpeg?width=244&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b746ffc77c3bd0d4a3bc16e4997ea2dd61bcf38c Our own Højlund.
6828,Man United,"I really thought the kid was 18

The guy is a beast on a pitch size wise compared to others he’s been playing with

What the fuck are those kids eating these days ? fufu"
6829,Man United,"This is standard procedure by the way so nothing special, still nice to see though regardless. Deals are usually already agreed at 16 when they move. "
6830,Man United,Hope he stays humble. Stay humble eh
6831,Man United,Stjerneskud is translated more like rising star than shooting star. Stjerneskud is one to one Shooting Star though.
6832,Man United,Garnacho made his debut at the age of 17. Chido will reach that age on Friday. It's not beyond the realms of possibility that he could get a cameo before the end of the season. Fingers crossed! 
6833,Man United,Play him immediately 
6834,Man United,"If we can't make the signings we need in January or the summer, then I could see Amorim bringing up some of the youth players. Call them Amorims Adolescents. Ruben’s Rugrats"
6835,Man United,Hope he continues to progress and does well for the U21s this year. 
6836,Man United,Danish? I thought he was English According to Wikipedia he's eligible for England and played for the under 16s a couple of times but has since gone back to playing for Danish age groups. He was born in Copenhagen He's Nigerian
6837,Man United,"What are the odds he starts a senior game before Christmas? Let's not rush it, please. Whatever they are, it’s too low. Not happening. 0 ""Starts"" is very low. Features? Very low Nill."
6838,Man United,When's he joining the first team? 
6839,Man United,"With current state of our attackers he could probably make appearances, sooner rather than later and as proven, you show enough you *will* play first team.

Balls in his court... "
6840,Man United,look like Malacia cousin. 
6841,Man United,I thought he was English 
6842,Man United,I was waiting for this. I want him involved this season already. 
6843,Man United,"I say just play him. Can’t be much worse than Rashford, Hojlund and Zirkzee. Genuine question about our strikers hojlund and zirkzee. Are they genuinely shit or is it the weight of the united shirt. 


Secondly, I think its harsh to say they are shit as both Hojlund and Zirkzee had good seasons last season"
6844,Man United,"Going to sound cynical and too early to call, but getting the feeling he’s going to be someone we hype up and then sell. "
6845,Man United,This guy could put in a better shift than Rashford I reckon 
6846,Man United,I hope to god England are trying everything to get this kid in the setup.. him and Delap are a scary combo to think about. Delap? He’ll be a solid PL player but it’ll be like missing out on Ollie Watkins. Nothing to really care about. His parents are Nigerian and he was born in Denmark there's like 0 avenues for England qualification lol This is peak English pressure on youngsters. The kid is 17 and played a handful of games in the U18s. Let's give him a chance to develop himself.
6847,Man United,"He is, however, still the youngest Rasmus at our club *raises finger* 

... 

*lowers finger*"
6848,Man United,chanting 'he's one of our own' as he bangs a hattrick at the emirates 
6849,Man United,"That will be sweet but when he brings his u15 form to senior football and bangs in 9 against the scousers, that’s what I’m looking forward to Exactly. Drinks for everyone."

6900,Man United,Thanks for sharing anyways! I’m using this to troll city fans whenever I get the chance 🤣 
6901,Man United,"The amount of games Garna is getting is a testament to how poor we are as an attacking team and the lack of attacking fire power we have. Don't get me wrong, Garna is great, with amazing qualities... but we should have atleast a couple players ahead of him as our main forwards, allowing him to not burn out. We are not Real Madrid, Barca or Bayern. Garna is playing enough for a team on our level. As hard as that sounds, besides Rashford can slot in for him and he can be benched. So we at least have depth in his position."
6902,Man United,"One of our best players, but i struggle to see where he fits in Amorim's 343.  
Don't think wingback suits him very well, and i personally wouldn't use him as a 10.  
Looking forward to see how Amorim chose to use him this season. Wasnt he playing as an insde forward in the last game and not Wingback?"
6903,Man United,"Would I happily see Garnacho be benched? Yes.

Is there someone I would happily see bench Garnacho? No. Not amad?"
6904,Man United,"Unpopular opinion: Garnacho is our top scorer and has the most attacking talent out of any of our wide players and works his socks off every game, in terms of the current squad, I think he starts. 

Don't get me wrong, IDEALLY I would prefer a more experienced player to bench him so he could develops properly, but this current squad is so garbage that I think there isn't much choice I think he is too selfish with the ball and doesn't pass to others who are in better positions than him. He wants all the glory, always trying to shoot and score than pass to someone else to score. His decision making needs to improve significantly Look who he’s scored against. Two against Barnsley, one off the bench against Southampton and one off the bench against Leicester. He’s looked scarily out of his depth against top level sides this season. His goals don’t tell the whole story. Absolute myth that Ten Hag developed him well. He looks the same exact player as he did in 2022, possibly even lost a bit of pace from bulking up a bit.  Disappointing how this is now an unpopular opinion here... maybe I should spend less time on here. I’m sorry hard disagree. He’s not strong or paces enough. Last game twice and many other times he was clean through with few yard head start of defenders and they always catch him and bully him off the ball 

Any other top forward is racing away Yup, the squad's trash. Thanks to a certain bald fraud replacing half our squad with second rate dutch league players. We're never winning anything with any of them at the club. If INEOS were serious about us contending for the big title within the next 5 years, the squad need to be purged from top to bottom, bar a few of the youngsters like Garnacho, Mainoo, Yoro etc. but vast majority should be let go.

If someone had told me 15 years ago that United's 2024 squad would literally struggle to get even a single player into any of the top 10 PL starting XI, I would literally fall on my knees in disbelief. Rashford has twice the attacking talent of Garnacho. The fact that he was shunted around last season to prioritise a 19 year old with 3 league goals (which probably hastened his own decline) was a terrible bit of management."
6905,Man United,He should be spending more time on the bench because he isn't doing it and needs to learn to play for the team rather than himself. And who should be playing ahead of him?
6906,Man United,"Young lads usually want to play every game. Club's responsibility to manage his minutes so he doesn't tail off too early.

No guarantee that he is a superman who never gets injured despite playing a ton.

Would also be unfair for the player when the club overplays him and cast him aside when he has outlived his usefulness"
6907,Man United,I think in the new formation we will see more rotation 
6908,Man United,I understand Ganarcho is young and still improving his game. I wish he was less selfish and had better vision and decision making to pass the ball to players in better position than him 
6909,Man United,He needs to spend time on the passing bench lol 
6910,Man United,"He’s not good enough for man United to be a starter. 

Think of it like this, which other top 8 team is he starting for? 

Is he better than players like Son or Doku? Leon Bailey or Joelinton?  Not a chance he’s getting to any of the starting 11s of those teams He keeps being indulged and will never learn. He's a talented player. But his utilisation has been awful. He missed important chances while on the left and Rashford on the right earlier this season that Rashford would score. Garnacho was decent on the right last season too. Ten Hag was just clueless."
6911,Man United,"He needs rest and he shouldn’t feel like the weight of getting results resting solely on him. In an ideal world his senior counterpart (Rashford) would be banging in goals letting Garnacho make mistakes without the pressure of dropping points. The kid has a killer mentality tho so I see why that would be difficult. 

I feel the same way about Kobbie. The fact that he’s our only press resistant midfielder speaks volumes about the shit scouting at the club. Ideally he’d have someone next to him to ease the pressure of him. "
6912,Man United,"our most talented attacker by a mile. would be inexcusable if we couldn’t find a place for him going forward.

also absolutely ridiculous how some fans try and make him a scapegoat. he’s still only 20 (2 years younger than amad) and already one of our most reliable goalscorers for the 3rd season running. would be tearing up the league in a functional team with real leaders around him. "
6913,Man United,"He's taken both benefits and also deficits largely, IMO, due to our complete failings with the Sancho and Antony transfers.

Rashford is the only winger/striker we have over the age of 25. Literally 1 player in their 'peak' years. Banked too hard on Sancho and Antony immediately being great, both were shit, forcing him in to like 50 starting XIs in a row or whatever the stat was. Had we done things differently and we had some senior guys in their prime years, you'd see a better Garnacho cause he'd have less pressure, and more rest.

Garnacho should be in a position where he starts games but can be rotated out if necessary. He's 20! He can still be the main man but right now we're expecting the main-man every week which is unfair pressure. "
6914,Man United,He's not that good. 
6915,Man United,"That’s an opinion, which anyone can have. The Journo doesn’t work at the club and doesn’t make decisions for the club, so the opinion means fuck all. Shut up and find something else to write about. City suck (currently), spend all your efforts writing those pieces so I can frame the headlines. Smh > The Journo doesn’t work at the club and doesn’t make decisions for the club, so the opinion means fuck all.

By that brilliant logic no one except club employees should write journalistic pieces about the club. K."
6916,Man United,"We are not Real Madrid, Barca or Bayern. Garna is playing enough for a team on our level. As hard as that sounds, besides Rashford can slot in for him and he can be benched. So we at least have depth in his position. Thats bullshit, he's just turned 20 this year and he's already made 105 appearances for us - it's too much Rashford can slot in for him but probably not very well"
6917,Man United,Wasnt he playing as an insde forward in the last game and not Wingback? 
6918,Man United,Not amad? Then who plays RWB? and if its another starter who covers them?

Rashford chief amongst them. I'm not sure why there is a push for someone who we have never seen do it over someone who has done it in the past in multiple different systems for multiple different managers.

Getting the best out of Rashford should be the priority and yet Ten Hag just said nah. Probably because Rashford was friendly with Sancho."

Garna is 3 years older and has played 10 90s more. How do you know with certainty it is too much, do you have any points of reference?"
6930,Man United,Rashford can slot in for him but probably not very well

Mount just got back and Amad was needed at RWB. Mount is usually injured and Amad will probably be used as a RWB. So who else?"
6934,Man United,"Literally anyone in the squad who can play the position. Rashford chief amongst them. I'm not sure why there is a push for someone who we have never seen do it over someone who has done it in the past in multiple different systems for multiple different managers.

Getting the best out of Rashford should be the priority and yet Ten Hag just said nah. Probably because Rashford was friendly with Sancho. "
6935,Man United,For context Lamine Yamal has played the equivalent of 60 90 mins for club and country. Garna is 3 years older and has played 10 90s more. Yes and that's a bad thing Yes and how has that approach fair for Barça over the last couple of years?
6936,Man United,"How do you know with certainty it is too much, do you have any points of reference? Aside from the rise in high-profile young players getting injured, I'd point to the performances of Garnacho himself. He looks exhausted. He should really be rotating with more experienced players but instead he's had to carry a lot of the burden himself."
6937,Man United,"Put amad as a 10 and play mazraoui as a wingback and start martinez Martinez is injured still. Ideally Garna would be benched but practically I don't see it.

We really don't have enough fit quality players at 10, LWB, RWB, CB to make it all mesh."
6938,Man United,"Fitness and depth in other positions matters though. 

Mount just got back and Amad was needed at RWB. "
6939,Man United,Mount is usually injured and Amad will probably be used as a RWB. So who else? Don't be surprised to see Antony on RWB with Amad on 10 and Garnacho benched
6940,Man United,Yes and that's a bad thing 
6941,Man United,Yes and how has that approach fair for Barça over the last couple of years?

6943,Man United,"Martinez is injured still. Ideally Garna would be benched but practically I don't see it.

We really don't have enough fit quality players at 10, LWB, RWB, CB to make it all mesh. We have plenty of players who can play. If martinez is injured then shaw can start at centerback. There isnt any need to start garnacho and especially not at the detriment of putting our best attacker out of position"
6944,Man United,Don't be surprised to see Antony on RWB with Amad on 10 and Garnacho benched Hahahahaha you’re joking right?
6945,Man United,"We have plenty of players who can play. If martinez is injured then shaw can start at centerback. There isnt any need to start garnacho and especially not at the detriment of putting our best attacker out of position No we literally don't. If Shaw covers CB then who is playing LWB? Because Garna deserves it more than Dalot especially if we play a more defensive player like Maz on the other side. I'm also not holding my breath on him staying fit.

In a side like ours Garna deserves the minutes. (Obviously not saying Amad doesn't more)"
6946,Man United,"Hahahahaha you’re joking right? Amad is going to 10, Maz and Dalot are playing wingbacks after a few trainings, maybe even Shaw, holjund at 9. That's how i see it. Amorim literally had Antony on RWB in the last training video"
6947,Man United,"No we literally don't. If Shaw covers CB then who is playing LWB? Because Garna deserves it more than Dalot especially if we play a more defensive player like Maz on the other side. I'm also not holding my breath on him staying fit.

In a side like ours Garna deserves the minutes. (Obviously not saying Amad doesn't more) Shaw wouldnt be playing as a wingback in the first place. He is playing as the left centerback. Dalot deserves to be starting over garnacho and if not then malacia is nearly ready so its just a few games of starting Dalot until he is ready (he was on the bench vs ipswich so he is close). Garnacho doesnt deserve anything. He has to earn his minutes just like everyone else and he hasnt for a good bit."

6951,Man United,"The 28-year-old’s charity, the Andre Onana Foundation, provides free medical care and high-quality surgeries to underprivileged communities in Cameroon, and other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The foundation collaborates with a group of surgeons and medical professionals who each year provide life-changing surgery and care to hundreds of people, particularly children.
Doctors working with Onana’s foundation have performed over 1,200 surgical operations over the last three years.

Writing on FIFPRO.org, Onana said: “When I passed through Barcelona, Amsterdam and Milan on my way to Manchester United, I had people who helped me on that journey. 

“When I was down, they gave me a hand so that I could stand up. I’ve never forgotten the help I received. Because of the people in the past who supported me, I feel I have a responsibility to give back and help others.

“When I started the Andre Onana Foundation, the idea was to help blind children in Cameroon. We received a lot of support and it’s since grown to become an NGO that provides free medical care and surgeries to children and adults from underprivileged communities.

“We bring doctors and surgeons, mostly from Spain, to perform the procedures in Africa. In July this year, we had our fourth surgical campaign where a delegation of Spanish health professionals – from nurses to paediatric surgeons – helped over 350 people in Yaoundé, Cameroon’s capital.”
Onana’s United team-mate Marcus Rashford is a previous winner of the FIFPRO Impact Award in 2020, when a campaign he led ensured disadvantaged children in the United Kingdom would continue to receive free school meals when schools were closed.

FIFPRO, the global union for professional footballers, will be donating $10,000 to the Andre Onana Foundation to further support their work.

Onana said: “I want to thank FIFPRO and the Cameroonian player union Synafoc; this big donation is very welcome, and our team already have plans in place to do some nice things for the kids, hopefully in cooperation with UNICEF.

“As for the future of the Andre Onana Foundation, we have a lot of things ahead. We’re in conversation with the United Nations to do a collaboration and our main priority going forward is to impact as many people as we can in the world.” "

Whatever you think of him as a goalkeeper, this is the kind of thing that makes a difference in the world. Fantastic work by the guy. Even as a goalkeeper, hes certainly top three in the prem! The second he became a red, I was all in. He has never disappointed me because even in rough times, his leadership was there and I’ve never second guessed his passion.  This season and stuff like this makes me appreciate him even more."
6953,Man United,Is there anything he can’t save A certain Dutchman's job
6954,Man United,Leader on and off the pitch! Good player but even better person! 💪 
6955,Man United,Love to see it 👏👏👏 
6956,Man United,"It's weird the level of vitriol posted towards him and those people just ride off into the sunset and move on to the next scapegoat. Though hopefully the team will improve enough there won't be enough scope to have such an ignorant campaign towards a player. One going on for a youth product with 421 appearances for the club now is wild. Goldbridge had an agenda against him, probably contributed towards the toxicity."
6957,Man United,"Brilliant, things you love to see "
6958,Man United,"I love this guy.

So happy he turned his form around. Feel like he’s perfect for Amorim "
6959,Man United,"Love seeing this kind of thing. When you have a platform you can make such a difference, but so few people use it well. This is how every player should impact the world. "

6961,Man United,Top man. He's found himself again on the pitch too this season. 
6962,Man United,United always had good goalkeepers. 
6963,Man United,well in Andrey 
6964,Man United,What a man 
6965,Man United,"Got me and my mates thinking - if we were going to field a “Wholesome Eleven” from United’s history…who would we field? Onana could only make the bench for that squad, Harry Gregg MUST start for his actions at Munich (helped save teammates and other passengers by pulling them clear of the wreckage). Juan Mata definitely makes it and probably Park Ji Sung too"
6966,Man United,"Have to respect this.
Africans (some I've known) have a great cause to contribute and provide medical support in much needed areas in Africa. 
Kudos for them for giving back to help others regardless of pay scale! "
6967,Man United,As he deserves. Well done Andre! 
6968,Man United,"Just from his words you could tell he's a good man with a good head on his shoulders, to then see his actions match up is great. The kind of men we need in the squad "
6969,Man United,"""My killer"" "
6970,Man United,"Honestly his redemption has being amazing , getting slander of fan channels and always getting compared to De gea from a certain guy who feeds off negative, "

6972,Man United,"[deleted] Have you watched a match lately? Um

He's had numerous saves of BIG chances. The dude's impact on our team probably keeps us out of the relegation zone, at this point."
6973,Man United,"Even as a goalkeeper, hes certainly top three in the prem! This season I don't see who has been better in the Prem, he has saved so many points for United this season, without him I don't even want to think were United would be... I'll admit, I was heavily in favour to bin Onana, last season was just awful. He's seriously turned himself to one of the best in the league this season. Feels good not having to worry about a keeper since we had prime DDG. Yep I thought he won the player impact award for his form this season so far and thought it was justified… then I finished reading the remainder of the headline lol still justified!"

we should have deservingly lost that match 5-0 minimum if not for onana 😂😂"
6976,Man United,"Goldbridge had an agenda against him, probably contributed towards the toxicity. Yeah the fans are affected by these caricature commenters and alternative comms videos. An opinion becomes the normalised idea and because rival fans are more likely to engage with those videos too they shit on the players and United fans don't even defend them. This fanbase is really toxic. Probably a result of the club actively trying to turn it into a soap opera in recent years for engagement."

Alisson would probably be up there if he didn't get injured, but this season Onana and Raya are top 2 for sure I think david raya has been a beast, apart from that I totally agree!!"

Feels good not having to worry about a keeper since we had prime DDG. Were you watching the second half of last season at all? He has been consistently improving since January. He wasn’t even *that* bad in the league in the first half of the year, he mainly had a number of notable shitty performances in Europe, but that was only 6 games. 

And even if he were bad all year, how ridiculous a football fan do you have to be to bin off a player after a single season? By that logic De Gea should’ve been binned off in 2012 after an iffy first year himself! Those UCL games were so horrible that they blinded everyone to how good he was in the 2nd half of the season Still feel like he has the odd mistake in him but he's so much more consistent and his positioning over the last couple months have been a major improvement. The chances Ipswich had yesterday would have been easy finishes if he wasn't in the right place.

In passing yesterday he seemed much more composed than usual too. I noticed his hoofs up were often in a good position for the outfielders to hold up too rather than going wayward towards the opposition. Feel like he'll really start to thrive in this formation."

It was mistakes that are always picked up on, he wasn't at fault for said goal, but the keeper should have done better, was countless times last season. His positioning last season was dreadful and not where you'd except a keeper to be. Always parrying into danger.

De Gea came into the team as a project, Onana is the finished article, not the same thing.

Keepers can also be judged differently to outfield players as they're ability to stop goals doesn't really correlate with the teams tactics. Eg a striker can be excused if the managers set up is awful."

We didn’t make it out of the groups last season. Any sort of reprise run sees us match that  Too many variables and information we're not privy to for anybody to give a positive or negative outlook.

For example, how are the sponsorships affected by being out of the Champions League. Old Adidas deal only 'punished' us if it was consecutive seasons, new one is for every season we're out of the competition.

This year you get €16M just for being in the Champions League group stage, only €4M for Europa League.

7037,Man United,"**Key Bits from the article:**



\- **Ruben Amorim is keen to limit his media dealings as Manchester United’s new head coach in an attempt to maximise the time he has to work with his players** – and shift the focus away from him.



\- Amorim is hoping to moderate his media responsibilities in order to spend as much time as possible with his new squad as they adapt to his methods.



\- There is no suggestion Amorim will not honour all of his contractual commitments to media. Yet he wants as few distractions as possible



\- h**e wants as few distractions as possible** as he schools his players in the inner workings of his 3-4-2-1 system in the small windows available to him in mid-season and **is understood to have little interest in the spotlight himself.**



\- **he is understood to feel that the fitness levels need raising** to cope better with the intensity of the Premier League and stop the team falling away in matches.



\- **Amorim has been simulating loss of possession and turnovers** in training by blowing his whistle to cut attacks short and demand his players race back.



\- **Amorim has been drilling his players in a 4-2-2-2 shape when playing out from the back.** Against Ipswich, that involved the outside centre-backs Noussair Mazraoui and Jonny Evans pulling wide and middle centre-back Matthijs de Ligt stepping into midfield alongside Casemiro, triggering a domino effect further ahead. United had an additional player to bypass Ipswich’s press and there was an emphasis on shorter, sharper passes. “He’s really demanding,” Dalot said. “He’s exactly what we need for this type of club.”





\- **In training, Amorim has been working on diagonal switches** from the central midfielder to an onrushing wing-back, with the No 10s then offering a pass in behind by making under-lapping channel runs so they can then deliver crosses or cutbacks from the byline.



\- **This is an area of the pitch in which Amorim is thought to be keen to utilise Mason Mount**, once the England midfielder is fully fit again. Mount is familiar with those kind of third-man runs, having flourished in Thomas Tuchel’s 3-4-2-1 system at Chelsea en route to Champions League glory in 2021. Could a Sporting fan come in and explain this to me? I'm struggling rn. One big issue in the diagonals and you could see it every single time against Ipswich, You had 3 forwards pressing our 3 centre backs. 

But it took two passes for the ball to get from de ligt to a wing back when it should only take one pass to get behind the press. 

Pure laziness from lots of players not getting into free space whether it was the tens or Rashford. And you could see a clear difference with holjund running channels and willing to work. >he is understood to feel that the fitness levels need raising to cope better with the intensity of the Premier League and stop the team falling away in matches.

The year is 2070. After some initial success in early seasons, Man United have parted ways with headcoach Bionic-Mourinho 5000, citing poor results that do not reflect the 10 trillion Amazon Credits invested in the squad.

Luke Shaw is expected to be out for 8-10 weeks."
7038,Man United,"How does this team *always* need to improve its fitness? Think this more of a polite way of saying ""leave everything on the pitch you lazy bastards"" or something like that Was my thoughts too

Has been an issue that has come up a lot iver the last few seasons. Especially when new managers come in. They are often ‘shocked’ by the fitness level of the group (at least so say the media)

FWIW I think it’s not so much base fitness, more so the strength / conditioning / intensity and quick recovery aspects that we look well off You can always improve your fitness, or modify the type of fitness you have but being able to apply your fitness in a constructive way on the pitch is probably more the issue.

Most of this team will have good stamina-fitness, they are professional athletes but not necessarily all have explosive fitness. Explosive, anaerobic fitness with good mechanical fitness (condition of musculoskeletal stuff) and a minimum standard of aerobic fitness (endurance) is probably the best combination of fitness for football in this era of the game. Explode, recover, endure. Probably has always been true to varying extent.

Switching from a certain profile of fitness to this, new, overall profile of fitness might be what Amorim is most interested in doing. He has said intensity alot and you see it in his Sporting team, the application of having explosivity and the mechanical fitness to not be easily injured by it, whilst being able to see out at least 60 minutes of that through endurance. I don't think many of our playes have all three components of this at the moment. Some are explosive and fast, some have good endurance, some have good mechanical fitness and dont injure easily but not many have it all. Probably Bruno is the closest but even he lacks a little bit of explosivity in his athletecism for an elite premier league standard. Different schools of thought and some misfires in terms of focus, could be a reason. 

Like for example we know the players ran a lot under Ten Hag, but were they running in the right way for how he wanted to play, or were they “just” running? 

We also know Ten Hag liked to punish the players by making them train and run on their days off. Seemingly starting a bad circle of not recovering properly, which in turns leads to less progress.

We all know there’s been a lot of talk about a lot of things being the same at United for a long time, and facilities etc being a bit outdated. Is it possible we’ve stuck with outdated training practices for far too long? Well, some of our key players are old, injury-prone, or lazy. Casimero, Eriksen, Maguire, Evans - none of these guys have the fitness required for this system. Shaw, Malacia, Maz are historically all injury prone. Rashford is typically the lazy one.

That means, that of our starting lineup from Ipswich - Bruno, Amad, Garnacho, Dalot and MDL were the only players with enough fitness for this system. No wonder we played like we did.

I do think that when we get Yoro, Ugarte, Mainoo, Mount and Hojlund back in the lineup, we'll see noticeable improvement. But this summer will have to ensure that we get more fit depth It's a very on the money cliche in football that any new manager coming into a squad will almost immediately question the squad's fitness and think they can improve it.

This occurs in both non-league and the premier league. Right?! Feels like you hear this every other week. But on the evidence it does seem right, every match there have been spells where the side look completely gassed. Not sure what can give though, one of the knocks against ETH was that his trainings were super hard and didn't offer enough recovery time. The only reason I can think of for this to keep happening is that the players are overpaid and its psychologically causing them to not put in the effort they should. We've had multiple managers, some players who have been under more than one, and yet the same fitness issues continue to be a cause for concern. What could possibly be stopping these players from reaching their best if it isn't something related to money? Got rid of the burgers and chips? I think the players can run for a long time leisurely, that’s no problem. But they… aren’t known for their intensity. So I’m guessing it’s related to that."
7039,Man United,"I think Mount is the key in what Amorim wants to do, has the intensity and energy but putting my faith in someone this injury prone really keeps me up at night. I reckon we’ll see some different players Thursday. I can see Martinez or Shaw (LCB), Ugarte, Mainoo, Mount and Hojlund coming in. 

Amorim doesn’t have a lot of games that he can use to experiment, so I expect to see a rotated side. It was the same in the case of EtH. Imagine Mount staying fit and performing very well for Amorim. The 180 that would be done on him would be interesting. So many fans on here were so upset that he was a wasted acquisition but could be the catalyst to push this squad forward under Amorim. God I hope with the new ways Amorim and his staff like to keep injuries down they can find a way to make this happen. Makes it even weirder he bought Zirkzee off the Ben h in that position instead of him Mount hasn't done one thing with the ball since he joined the club. His pressing is good but we need creativity and elite competence on the ball. We haven't seen a single example of it from mount"
7040,Man United,"The club should go on the offensive and flood the media with a load of non-stories. 

I’m really happy to see him take action here and identify that as a problem area. Hopefully it works, and helps stave off the rapid ageing process our managers undergo. 

Any changes made to not be the media’s lapdog will be a resounding positive in my book. I for one am behind this. Up to their elbows in straw men. I'd honestly love that if we did.

BREAKING: Ruben Amorim spotted getting a chai latte from the training ground cafe.

More news to follow. 

Does Amorims coffee choice hint at his selection at the weekend? 👀

Ngl, it just reads like a Daily Mail puff piece though. I'm sure someone would lap it up."
7041,Man United,"**Article:**

Ruben Amorim is keen to limit his media dealings as Manchester United’s new head coach in an attempt to maximise the time he has to work with his players – and shift the focus away from him.

The Portuguese took charge of his first game in Sunday’s 1-1 draw against Ipswich Town at Portman Road and joked afterwards that he had spoken to the media more in a week as United manager than he did during four and a half years as Sporting coach.

Yet Amorim was making a more serious point when he said: “I just want to work with my players, nothing more.”

The 39-year-old’s first post-match interview with Sky Sports was rudely interrupted by Ipswich fan Ed Sheeran, for which the singer subsequently apologised to the United head coach. “Apologies if I offended Amorim yesterday, didn’t actually realise he was being interviewed at the time, was popping to say hi and bye to Jamie \[Redknapp\]. Obvz feel a bit of a b---end but life goes on,” Sheeran posted on Instagram.

But Amorim is hoping to moderate his media responsibilities in order to spend as much time as possible with his new squad as they adapt to his methods.

There is no suggestion Amorim will not honour all of his contractual commitments to media. Yet he wants as few distractions as possible as he schools his players in the inner workings of his 3-4-2-1 system in the small windows available to him in mid-season and is understood to have little interest in the spotlight himself.

With a congested schedule and little time between matches to work on his ideas in training, Amorim knows this process will not be easy and warned that United will “suffer for a long period”.

Here, Telegraph Sport takes a closer look at what the Portuguese has been trying to implement in his handful of training sessions and single match to date...

# Tracking back

“We have to be better running back. I think that is clear for everybody,” Amorim said last week. That was immediately apparent to Amorim in footage he watched of United’s games before formally arriving at Old Trafford, but since getting to work with the players he is understood to feel that the fitness levels need raising to cope better with the intensity of the Premier League and stop the team falling away in matches.

Amorim has been simulating loss of possession and turnovers in training by blowing his whistle to cut attacks short and demand his players race back. Amorim could be seen ordering his players to recover positions quickly when they lost the ball against Ipswich. Diogo Dalot said Amorim’s messaging was clear on that front: “Sprint back and be really hard working.” # 4-2-2-2- build-up

Amorim has been drilling his players in a 4-2-2-2 shape when playing out from the back. Against Ipswich, that involved the outside centre-backs Noussair Mazraoui and Jonny Evans pulling wide and middle centre-back Matthijs de Ligt stepping into midfield alongside Casemiro, triggering a domino effect further ahead. United had an additional player to bypass Ipswich’s press and there was an emphasis on shorter, sharper passes. “He’s really demanding,” Dalot said. “He’s exactly what we need for this type of club.”

Part of Sporting’s title success under Amorim last season was down to their resistance to the press and this is an area the Portuguese feels United need a huge amount of work as he bids to introduce a more progressive build-up and exert greater control. Or as Dalot puts it: “Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball. The message he gave to everybody was clear: he wants us to have more control of the games. And that’s what we want to do.”

Another feature was the outside centre-backs jumping in to man-mark Ipswich’s Omari Hutchinson and Sammie Szmodics. With Lisandro Martínez, who is not expected to be fit to face Bodo/Glimt on Thursday or Everton three days later, Leny Yoro, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof all unavailable, Amorim’s options at centre-back were limited. But it was still a huge physical demand to place on the 36-year-old Evans, who struggled against the pace and movement of Hutchinson, 15 years his junior. Amorim’s tactic was clear, though, even if it backfired at times.

# Switches of play

This has been one of the biggest features of Amorim’s training sessions to date and United’s intentions against Ipswich on that front were obvious, even if they struggled to execute those instructions as cleanly and frequently as they would have wanted. Indeed, it was a quick switch of play across the back line from which their goal originated after just 81 seconds.

In training, Amorim has been working on diagonal switches from the central midfielder to an onrushing wing-back, with the No 10s then offering a pass in behind by making under-lapping channel runs so they can then deliver crosses or cutbacks from the byline.

This is an area of the pitch in which Amorim is thought to be keen to utilise Mason Mount, once the England midfielder is fully fit again. Mount is familiar with those kind of third-man runs, having flourished in Thomas Tuchel’s 3-4-2-1 system at Chelsea en route to Champions League glory in 2021.

# Control and being compact

United’s average position was much lower than that of Ipswich over the 90 minutes and, for all the flaws in the performance, it was notable how much more compact they were out of possession than under Erik ten Hag, whose United were especially vulnerable to opponents’ direct attacks.

Amorim identifies more readily with his compatriot Jose Mourinho than a Pep Guardiola in terms of philosophy and it showed. At times against Ipswich there were eight or nine men behind the ball and fewer wide-open spaces.

Amorim felt they surrendered control too often by needlessly turning over the ball, and Kieran McKenna’s side had some success exploiting the space behind the wing-backs. But the desire for greater defensive stability was obvious.

7042,Man United,"I think we could have hired a 100 different managers with 100 different systems and one of the first things we'd hear is how much they like Mount. I think he highlights a gulf between what fans think makes a player and what managers want to actually see. 

Now whether or not he can stay fit enough to actually meaningfully contribute is unfortunately looking like a very uncomfortable question also why Fellaini was pretty universally used and loved by all his managers, as much as the fans gave him shit, same goes for McTominay I'd have an opinion on Mount if I'd seen him play a few games on a United shirt. Consecutively."
7043,Man United,"It really is astonishing that this group, on the wage they are on, won't put in the running required to match opponents. This has been the case for months. It's also incredible how such a poor group has been assembled. Elite level wages for mid table players. The ineptitude throughout the entire club has been absolutely appalling. It really is mind Boggling just how many fuck ups have taken place at this club. In saying all that, I really hope they give Amorim a good 3 season stretch now, at least. Regardless of how bad it gets. The day they eventually phase out the likes of Rashford will be when things start to take shape I feel. He embodies everything that's wrong with the club in terms of ethic and application. So tired of so many players in this side tho. It's just shit show after shit show, never ending. I'm really tired of rashford too it's been long enough he's reaching his 30s in a couple seasons."
7044,Man United,"ETH had to go jogging with the players, trained them hard to be able to play intense pressing and constantly moving. ETH left, the players ran a pathetic amount again under the new manager and now we need to improve their fitness once more, what the fuck is going on It's not rocket science. Quite a few players that featured on Sunday either can't, won't or don't know when to run or press:

Casemiro

Eriksen

Evans

Rashford

Shaw

Zirkzee

You're not getting the ball back with these players, which in turn puts more pressure on the likes of Fernandes, Garnacho and Amad to win the ball back to the detriment of their attacking game."
7045,Man United,By ignoring all the media noise and focusing on the long term goal! 
7046,Man United,We'll need a big ass charger to charge this club 
7047,Man United,"Fitness is a big issue for long not just during ten Hag but during Ole and Rangnick too. I dont understand why the team this big lack of fitness. We could hire sport scientist, nutrition expert, fitness coach etc. "
7048,Man United,I really hope Mount can stay fit... seems he will be crucial to how Amorim wants to play. 
7049,Man United,Luke being back will solve a lot of the balance issues. Same with the cbs who are coming bavk from injury and getting to full fitness. 
7050,Man United,"Do any of the other clubs regularly get these complete breakdown of their tactics? It seems like it only happens to United, and I would say it's a bit of a disadvantage just allowing other managers and coaches to read the newspaper to know the intricate details of our tactics. Saves them a lot of work "
7051,Man United,"I don't think it's as much fitness, as it is intensity. This team lacks intensity immensely. Also, some players cheat alot when it comes to effort, and it leaves the rest of the team hanging, having to pull up the slack. "
7052,Man United,"We need a full preseason it's been absolutely ages since we last had one.

Wanna know why that is, it's because we need the money thanks to the state the Glazers have put us in. 

We need that at the end of this season but hey we're off to america again. 

Also Amorin is right, this team needs to purely concentrate on football. less press, less events and a full commitment to this club above even national teams. 

That's the commitment we had when we won stuff under fergie. "
7053,Man United,"Could a Sporting fan come in and explain this to me? I'm struggling rn. Tier 1 Analysts, Sporting fans. Op must be a sporting fan. Have my upvote 😂 😂😂😂 You dont need to be sarcastic, I take it as a sign that they are passionate. 

And United doesn't go to sporting often, but when we do it's always lights out - Ronaldo, Bruno...."
7054,Man United,"One big issue in the diagonals and you could see it every single time against Ipswich, You had 3 forwards pressing our 3 centre backs. 

But it took two passes for the ball to get from de ligt to a wing back when it should only take one pass to get behind the press. 

Pure laziness from lots of players not getting into free space whether it was the tens or Rashford. And you could see a clear difference with holjund running channels and willing to work. "
7055,Man United,">he is understood to feel that the fitness levels need raising to cope better with the intensity of the Premier League and stop the team falling away in matches.

The lack of intensity at the end of games speaks of a team that just wants the final whistle to blow, regardless of the result.

7067,Man United,"I think Ducker is speculating on what Amorim feels about fitness levels for your clicks. 

What Amorim said was the players were thinking too much, trying to figure it out. Just give them another week or so. He needs to know how to use the players as well. "
7068,Man United,It's what happens when the club isn't ruthless like our rivals like Arsenal. We consistently see players acting lazy match after match and then they perform well for a month and the club gives them mega contract extension. Arteta would have sent some of our players to Saudi already by telling them they won't play again for the club and are free to leave.

7098,Man United,"Simply not true. He's had limited time on the pitch but he's definitely been able to have creative passes. 

United fans are just so used to long hero balls that they think anything that isn't Bruno cunting it halfway up the pitch isn't creative. Long hero balls is something he called Bruno put for as well, he doesn't want it happening as the default action Not only that but he also wins the ball high up the pitch which lead to dangerous quick attacks. Show me one creative pass Mount has made in a United shirt. I'll wait. He missed an open goal in his first game. I knew at that point he didn’t have the technical ability to be a ceiling raiser for us, but he raises the floor. Which is super useful if you’re fit enough to play consistently. But he’s not. I think this transfer will be a complete failure. But I hope I’m wrong. He's come on a few times to make ""creative passes"" and then we've just conceded and lost like when he came on to hold the win against Chelsea and we just conceded 2 and lost"

7101,Man United,"He drops them for who exactly? Given we'd be in and around the relegation fodder if Onana wasn't having a quietly excellent season, I'd say he could drop them for youth players and the overall performances wouldn't get dramatically worse. Plus it would publically humiliate some players, which might be motivating for them."
7102,Man United,"I think it's due to the fact that we put players who don't deserve such wages on obscenely high wages, then they know the club cannot get rid of them if they become lazy. Just look at the salaries we give compared to our rivals and it's mind boggling. For example both De Gea and Dean Henderson had a higher salary than Liverpool's Allison and Allison's wages are due to winning PL and UCL. We gave our players wage rises for winning nothing at all. You are assuming their salary affects their play.  I doubt very much so, that's not what motivate high earners as a rule."

7104,Man United,"Long hero balls is something he called Bruno put for as well, he doesn't want it happening as the default action I was glad he mentioned it. It's really frustrating. This is an important test for Bruno. He needs to make sure he has tactical discipline.

He basically said out loud 'bruno makes poor decisions. Every time he gets on the ball he looks for a Hollywood pass.' I love Bruno so much when the hero ball works he's the best player in the world, problem is it only works 1/15 times and end ups as an easy loss of possession instead. 

I'm really hoping he can adapt his game and slow it down a bit, take a bit more care of the ball. Bizzare criticism.

Bruno completed 49 of his 53 passes (92%), and 5 of his 7 long balls (71%), while creating effectively all the decent opportunities we had in the game outside of the goal. Set Garnacho up twice with two brilliant through balls, for example.

Maybe Bruno Fernandes isn't the problem and the rest of the wastemen who can't do their jobs are. Your logic is so funny.

Move on Bruno for hero ball passes and defend Mount who can't get on the pitch in any capacity

It's crazy when a new .manager is here fans on this forum accept any nonsense to feel positive about the team. This guy is actually suggesting we move on Bruno and use Mount instead and people agree a guy who can't get on the pitch and has been out of form for 4 seasons should replace Bruno?

Why don't we sell Eriksen,Casemiro and Ugarte and replace them all with single pivot Pogba? Same amount of brains in that suggestion.

Let's sell De Ligt and Martinez and replace with Bailly.

Bailly and Pogba get on the pitch more than Mount at United I'm p sure.

LMAO one of the funniest suggestions on this sub in recent memory.


The guy has been out of form for 4 years and injured in its entirety for 2 relying on a player like this to replace your own starter is just full on stupid sorry there's no backing that can make this opinion smart.

Why is there a group of fans on this sub who think a decent midfielder from 4 years ago who is perpetually injured will save the team? It's totally bonkers stupid belief.

**'Best in class' youth developers Curtis & Wiles join Man Utd Academy**

Manchester United have added “best-in-class youth developers” Tom Curtis and Simon Wiles to their Academy staff as they continue to revamp their coaching provision. 

Curtis has joined as Head of Player Development for the Youth Development Phase (Under-13s to U16s) – a role previously held by Adam Lawrence, who is now U18s Lead Coach. Curtis has worked for the Football Association for the last decade, most recently leading the England YDP.

Wiles (pictured) has joined as Lead U14s Coach, as well as being responsible for the programme of development across the U13s. He has previously worked as First-Team Coach at Salford City for the last two-and-a-half years. 

Meanwhile, **Tommy Rowe** joined earlier this season as an over-aged player-coach for the U21s, following in the footsteps of Tom Huddlestone and Paul McShane. Rowe was born in Wythenshawe and came through United’s Academy from 1996 to 2003 before playing at senior level for Stockport, Peterborough, Wolves, Bristol City and Doncaster Rovers.

Writing on LinkedIn, Rowe said: “Returning to my boyhood club has felt like a real full circle moment in my career and I’m so thankful for the opportunity to give back into the Academy where it all started for me. It has been really special to see so many of the coaches, who I owe so much to, still connected to the club.” 

In August, TGG revealed that a quartet of Academy coaches with more than 50 years’ combined service had left United as part of a club-wide restructure by minority owners INEOS. The coaches were Neil Harris, the Lead Youth Development Phase Coach, Stuart Leicester, the Lead Coach on the Manchester United Schoolboy Scholarship Scheme (MANUSS), Chris Backhouse, the Foundation Phase Lead Goalkeeping Coach, and Rich Ashcroft, the Lead Youth Development Phase Coach. Interestingly Alan Nixon reported on Wiles' move back on October 6th https://www.patreon.com/posts/man-u-snap-up-113412214 (paywall link but the title confirms the info). He's proven himself a very good news-getter at championship and below levels, just a shame he works for The S*n For anyone interested in the last 20 years of our youth development programme, Neil Harris has been doing a bit of media since his release and gives some interesting insights.

7142,Man United,"**Quotes:**

Maguire: ""Like the manager said in the interview, **people on the pitch are probably thinking too much of where they want to be.** At the end of the day its a football match, go & be better than the opponents. Go & win the football match. **I think we overthought the game against Ipswich""**



Maguire: ""The manager \[Amorim\] came in with new ideas, great energy. The first game was difficult, but I'm sure you'll see a lot of progress by the end of the season. In his meetings I've been very impressed with the way he speaks and the energy he gives to the team. That's what the team needs."" 



Maguire: ""Still early on the season. We've not had a great start. I still believe we should be fighting for European places come the end of the season""



Mazraoui : ""**My first impressions \[of the manager\] are really good. His social skills are on point. Everybody understands what he says directly. ""** I like the bold part by Mazraoui Lol at what Mazraoui said. That's exactly what I said in a previous post 2 weeks ago. ETH had issues with english and failed to properly transmit what he wanted to the players"
7143,Man United,"Maguire is actually one of the nicest lads at the club He has a good opportunity to not only make himself a starter but also be crucial to this season

He is slow though, so he could have problems playing up high sometimes, if he can manage to read the game and adapt to the tactics, making that first tackle up high on the pitch for a turnover could be his saving grace.

Otherwise i don't think Amorim wants slow CBs if he wants them to push up high so he's gonna move on from him."
7144,Man United,"This is what amorim is talking about. How many hours to the players waste travelling prepping and doing these interviews rather than coaching. Access needs to be restricted until results and performance improves. 


Who knows maybe they will appreciate it then and stop writing bullshit. > How many hours to the players waste travelling prepping and doing these interviews rather than coaching.

7145,Man United,Maz is going to be a top player for us. Think he will be key in the back 5 
7146,Man United,How the fuck do we’ve a million interviews on sky every week 
7147,Man United,"I am alone in finding Sky annoying? No, they are very annoying"
7148,Man United,Seems like communication was a big problem under Ten Hag. 
7149,Man United,"Unrelated, but I always find it weird how they never call the manager by his first name. Is it sort of like a teacher student relationship? "
7150,Man United,We need to cut the interviews down rapidly. They come off fine but why do they need to be doing this 
7151,Man United,"I think the “at the end of the day it’s a football match go and be better than the opponents” and smirk is him thinking he’s come up with something so profoundly clever. 

There are 3 dangers in life. Believing Manchester United is anywhere close to sorting it out, putting a mic in front of Maguire’s face, and I’m sure I’m forgetting a third. 

I like this interview because in one fell swoop they’ve shown us the future, and the past. I can imagine the only reason Maguire is retained is because he’s generally always available and availability is the best ability at this club of late. I simply cannot imagine he is retained because he’s this paragon of tactically astute high footballing IQ footballer who will fit Amorim’s setup like a hand in a velvet glove. 

Footballers like Harry Maguire are the epitome of why this club simply cannot transition to the modern style of football everyone here demands. It’s not even that he’s slow. It’s that he’s a slow decision maker and then makes the most predictable decision and puts in a hospital pass that gets pounced on and we face a shot on goal within seconds. I simply do not believe Amorim comes in here and turns him into Rio Ferdinand. It’s just far more likely he’s moved on like the so many others who are significantly limited and unfit for purpose at this club. Time will tell obviously. However, nobody should expect a coach to evolve his ways to accommodate these limited players to then produce a team that plays the way his Sporting did. 

If you really want to win with this team and throw your principles out, you set up in a low block and counter style of play. It’s what this club has set up for years even while it claims to be developing an allergic reaction towards. Maguire is a beast in that style of Jose Mourinho who wanted him so badly and for good reason. "
7152,Man United,"lmao @ Harry doing interviews about the new manager, swear he hasn't even been in training yet

giving media duties to only our injured players... genius 500IQ move, the marginal-ist of gains, we should only do that going forward. "
7153,Man United,"I like the bold part by Mazraoui ""Manchester United star SLAMS former manager Erik Ten Hag on the basis of where he originates!"""
7154,Man United,Lol at what Mazraoui said. That's exactly what I said in a previous post 2 weeks ago. ETH had issues with english and failed to properly transmit what he wanted to the players Tbf he could’ve said it in Dutch to Mazraoui

Otherwise i don't think Amorim wants slow CBs if he wants them to push up high so he's gonna move on from him. He's slow so we can't play a high line is brought up often despite the fact that Ole played the 4th highest line with him and Lindelof as defenders and it only for worse under EtH. Also should consider since Maguire didn't have much pace to begin with, he hasn't lost any and will probably not lose much as he ages anyway. Fast = definitely good for high line and slow = definitely bad for high line is not accurate at all.

I'll go further and post what may be seen as a hot take right now : If every CB is fit for the rest of the season, I think the most likely back 3 would be Yoro Maguire Martinez and if he accepts lower wages, the club and specifically Amorim will want to extend him despite his age Playing with 2 other Cbs can hide his weakness and emphasis his strenghts Horse for courses. Amorim used an aging Sebastian Coates as his anchoring CB, I'm sure he will find a use for Maguire. Ten Haag's system exposed Maguire's flaws, hopefully Amorim can restore his confidence and find a place in the squad for him."

can you elaborate on that?

i don't think thats a hot take, it is possible Wonder if he is comfortable pushing up as the centre CB as he is quite aggressive I agree about him being decent when playing a high line but as for slow players aging better — I’m not so sure. Sure, he’s always been slow. But you can always get slower. And going from (in fifa terms for lack of a better way) 40 pace to 20 is probably really hard to adjust to. “Fast = definitely good for a high line and Slow = definitely bad for a high line is not accurate at all”

Tell that to Pep, whose entire safety comes from having a bullet train in Kyle Walker when the rest of his mitigations fall apart. When their mitigations fall apart and their bullet train is falling apart, suddenly they look like they’re double dosing on catastrophic results week after week despite still boasting a gk most consider to be one of the best at playing with his feet and outside his box. 

Can you elaborate on what specific trend you’ve spotted that counteracts probably the most basic observation of the game please? Genuinely I’m curious if you’re on to something. You’re suggesting that a slow person can overcome a fast person over a fixed distance is literally flying in the face of performance data and the eyeball test in like 28 sports which involve running."
7161,Man United,Playing with 2 other Cbs can hide his weakness and emphasis his strenghts True and he has a fantastic long ball!
7162,Man United,"Horse for courses. Amorim used an aging Sebastian Coates as his anchoring CB, I'm sure he will find a use for Maguire. Ten Haag's system exposed Maguire's flaws, hopefully Amorim can restore his confidence and find a place in the squad for him. Maguire found form again under ten Hag… I understand he was not the right manager, but not everything he did was shit. >Amorim used an aging Sebastian Coates as his anchoring CB, I'm sure he will find a use for Maguire.

That's actually the sign of a good manager imo, but i'm talking with what he would ideally want in a CB if he had the choice"

7165,Man United,">Fast = definitely good for high line and slow = definitely bad for high line is not accurate at all.

can you elaborate on that?

i don't think thats a hot take, it is possible Pace and acceleration are not the only thing which determine a CB's possibility of winning a duel against a faster player. A far more important tool is positioning and anticipation. If a CB has the right positioning and anticipation, he doesn't rely on his pace to bail him out. Does that mean he won't lose a foot race against a faster player? No, of course not. However, it means that such a CB would give himself a starting position in most cases that would allow him to beat the faster attacker despite the lack of pace. Maguire's been slow all his life so he's never relied on his pace. If a fast player loses his pace, that becomes concerning because their mind tells their body to do things that it no longer can.

A similar example would be in strikers. Strikers like Benzema, Kane, Lewandowski, Zlatan never were the fastest/relied on their pace too much so they lasted longer into their 30s"

Because it's not always a race? If it turns into one, a slower player is toast, but if he's in the right position before the attacker gets a chance to leverage his pace, or if the attacker's touch is just a bit too heavy, then the defender doesn't have to chase them down, just close them down."

7170,Man United,"Maguire found form again under ten Hag… I understand he was not the right manager, but not everything he did was shit. "
7171,Man United,">Amorim used an aging Sebastian Coates as his anchoring CB, I'm sure he will find a use for Maguire.

That's actually the sign of a good manager imo, but i'm talking with what he would ideally want in a CB if he had the choice I would rather our manager maximize the use of our squad, rather than bin everyone off as a lost cause simply because they were signed by the previous manager and they want a blank check to start over. This has been the case ever since Moyes, and our management needs to put a stop to it. 

I'd compare Dunk to Maguire since they share similar profiles. He was a stalwart to multiple managers. Of course given an unlimited budget every manager would want Rudiger and Van Dijk as their center backs, but that's not possible so they should be making the best of their budget and current squad."
7172,Man United,"Oh right, you’re saying ‘likely’ because you actually have no idea the players’ schedules, and you’re just waffling out of your ass. Maguire may train. You think maz is doing full training. The day after. You have no cop on"
7173,Man United,"Pace and acceleration are not the only thing which determine a CB's possibility of winning a duel against a faster player. A far more important tool is positioning and anticipation. If a CB has the right positioning and anticipation, he doesn't rely on his pace to bail him out. Does that mean he won't lose a foot race against a faster player? No, of course not. However, it means that such a CB would give himself a starting position in most cases that would allow him to beat the faster attacker despite the lack of pace. Maguire's been slow all his life so he's never relied on his pace. If a fast player loses his pace, that becomes concerning because their mind tells their body to do things that it no longer can.

A similar example would be in strikers. Strikers like Benzema, Kane, Lewandowski, Zlatan never were the fastest/relied on their pace too much so they lasted longer into their 30s Yeah agreed with all that, my point is the space you leave open when you push up high, that's where the pace is needed, and if you read what i said in the first comment, i literally mentioned the first tackle needs to be succesfull for turnover so you don't have to chase the guy you were pressing if you fail to break their pattern of play."
7174,Man United,">You’re suggesting that a slow person can overcome a fast person over a fixed distance is literally flying in the face of performance data and the eyeball test in like 28 sports which involve running.

Because it's not always a race? If it turns into one, a slower player is toast, but if he's in the right position before the attacker gets a chance to leverage his pace, or if the attacker's touch is just a bit too heavy, then the defender doesn't have to chase them down, just close them down. Precisely. A slower CB relies on positioning to avoid a foot race as much as he can. In a 3 CB formation, flanked by Yoro and a fast left footed CB, Maguire's an easy starter. De Ligt's slow as well and for him also, I don't think that's a problem Maguire’s positioning like his game intelligence is quite poor when he’s not literally as close to the goal line as he can possibly be. He’s one of the reasons for the donut formation ETH used. Simply cannot have a high line with a player like Maguire. He’s phenomenal in a low block which is why it’s always baffled me we bought him and then Ole switched to trying out a high line. It’s just not what he’s good at and that’s ok. This club has to decide whether it wants to commit to a style of play or talk that sweet talk and then accommodate players it’s got who simply cannot play it."

Maguire is not just slow, he’s position just like his reading of the game is well below what you’d expect an elite CB playing for Manchester United to be. You see it in every feigned move he does where he tries to hold off on a pass and then puts in the most predictable pass when literally his delay closes off all other pass angles. What happens next? A hospital pass, a pounce by the opponents to retake possession and a shot on goal within seconds. 

And you’ve mentioned De Ligt as an example of how slow works… oh you’re so close to realizing whay De Ligt has in oodles that Maguire just doesn’t. 

At best he’s a poor fit for any modern system of play. He would be fantastic if this club actually decided low block and counter is the way it wants to play. Ironically it’s got more components to play that style than any of the modern pressing attacking styles it thinks it wants."

7205,Man United,"What I like about this is that for every decision the only thing that enters his mind is the importance to the team. He's not thinking about how spectacular the save is, he's thinking about whether it contributed to the result. He's got a great attitude, that's always been obvious. He's a team man. Which is strange as I’ve noticed a lot of older fans saying they think he’s too theatrical and wants the spotlight to be on him with the way he plays keeper. Which I can only put down to some subconscious racism or something? This. Team before him and that's a great leadership qualities we need right now. He has always had a great attitude. So glad he has turned around his shaky start and become immense in goal."

It’s exhausting People are too obsessed with now with having an opinion immediately. They’ve decided after a few games that Onana bad, and now they’re absolutely married to it.

I’ll be honest, I thought he was poor when he started, but he’s settled in really well and is now one of our most important players. I was wrong, and that’s not always a bad thing."

I AM one of the older fans, and I've not heard that being expressed by anyone I know, but perhaps I've missed it. A lot of the criticism I've seen of Onana comes from the younger, online, sort-of casual fans. People who don't actually watch the matches, but join in with the negativity for some kind of weird online clout. They picked up on him having a shaky start, and think he's some kind of meme, despite him being our best player this season.

Actually, there is a faction who target Onana out of some kind of misplaced loyalty to De Gea. They are reaching for anything to pin on Onana. I love DDG, and I think the club treated him shabbily at the end, but that's not Onana's fault, and it's possible to appreciate De Gea and kind of wish he was still here, and still appreciate Onana and recognise that he's a top keeper and a top guy."

7221,Man United,"Sporting's ability and bravery on the ball is just so stark compared to our players. 

Multiple phases of a play without a misplaced pass or touch. Incisive yet patient in attack. 

We have a loooooong way to go, but if we can get to this team's level, it would be such an exciting time. It’s a combination of tactical familiarity and personnel. Also remember players learn at different rates, and some may not be suitable for our setup at all. It seems players Amad, Mount and Mazraoui have learned a lot quicker. Mount I can understand because he has played in a 3-4-3 before. Their CBs are so brave with the ball. We need Licha and Yoro back ASAP."

Meanwhile, we can't score goals or play football properly.  We've sacked and hired another new manager.  We are in the bottom half of the league. We've only won 1 europa league match out of 4.

7250,Man United,"2 seasons ago, Gyokeres would be no where close to being mentioned to Utd. we spent £75M on a striker we should be improving  we spent €75m on a 20 y/o striker who had 9 league goals, hojlund should’ve been around £35m at most. he also should’ve been brought in under an experienced striker so he could actually develop. dumb and dumber splashing £60m with the hope he can be our main number 9 and suddenly tear up the prem when he didn’t even tear up the italian league was just idiotic. murtough madness though 🔥 

at least gyökeres is a proven goal scorer and one of the most inform players in the world. What does ‘two seasons ago’ have to do with anything? The man has scored 80 goals since then. Don't worry, Gyökeres rumours are far off the mark That the problem with UTD hierarchy we are not a club which buy to develop especially a £70+M player.We need a striker who is already complete and just develop our academy players. I’ve seen nothing from Rasmus to suggest he’s going to make it for us. Liam Delap was the best forward on the pitch on Sunday."
7251,Man United,"We need to start spending less on players. How many times have we seen our 60 mil players get outplayed by some championship/relegation player. These massive buys don't make any sense. 

Most important in my opinion is the players mentality, lots of players we currently have don't have the right mentality to play for this club Mentality is not enough. If you want both talent and mentality, that'll cost you about as much as the usual 60 mil players we buy. We need to choose better. We need to find the cohesive 11 and build based on that. True but I also don’t think big fees should be knocked because of incompetence. Utd of old paid big fees and top teams now still do, but when done competently, you get what you pay for - world class players. Paying world class fees for potential is incredibly stupid though and should never happen again. But like you allude to, there are very very few players worth more than 25m, and we keep finding players that aren’t yet paying 40+. Isidor for Sunderland is better than half the strikers we have or are linked with including I suspect a certain Swede in Portugal."
7252,Man United,"I'm constantly shocked by how often we give the ball away by misdirecting simple one touch passes in close range. Almost everyone makes these mistakes - Dalot, Rashford, Garnacho, Eriksen, Bruno etc. it's so far off the top teams' standards. "
7253,Man United,Why is it managers/head-coaches complain about player fitness yet it never seems to get resolved. What's going wrong? I think there are different types of fitness. Players could have good fitness to run long distances at a slow pace but not the fitness to make multiple sprints. Also it's an easy thing for any new manager to say to shift the blame on the previous guy and buy some time.

I just want him backed to do his thing. Yup if anyone (and I mean anyone) can't fit his system then they can fuck off Please pause on the “his team” bit. No offence but we are not doing that shite anymore nor should we. If he wants a certain player profile, let the recruitment guys sort it out and he should focus on coaching. If certain players don’t fit his profile, he should pass it onto the directors and let them sort it out. We don’t need him acting like a superman manager, he should be the head coach and coach"

7272,Man United,"One thing I love about my club and our fans is that we back our club and always give the managers a fair chance and the benefit of the doubt. 

Looking at the city subreddit the shit they spew on their manager who (despite the 115) won the league so many times is disgraceful. No loyalty at all and I’m glad that even in our worst era we’re still more classy than them.

If man city went through what we’ve been going through for the last 10 years, they would genuinely perish Wouldn’t exactly say that all fans are backing players/the manager. There was a lot of misery first ETH season and obviously ole out but even then it was a vocal minority. City are just a disgrace They did for the previous 50 years."

7281,Man United,"Can we get one of those I'm a Sporting fan post right about now? Cause they all sound like Sporting is a world beater lmao. I enjoyed reading their posts. More enjoyable than the drivel written by the papers. Head over to their sub, ‘Man Utd fan here’ as a United fan my advice would be to simply not be 3-0 down to Arsenal at home Nah, the americans can do the realistic and knowledgeable comments just right"
7282,Man United,"I wonder if Hojlund or Rashford starts next game. Surely Amorim wasn’t happy with Rashys performance He wasn’t happy with Rasmus either he was screaming at him to press their keeper at one point. I would prefer he starts Rasmus. I believe Rasmus has the scope to improve and be an Amorim striker, unlike Rashford."
7283,Man United,"Any Man United fans that wanna post ""an honest opinion"" of this Sporting performance, feel free. Dont be rude. They are only trying to help us"
7284,Man United,"I have less optimism than most, simply because people don't seem to understand how fucked we are financially. We need to replace big chunks of that squad, but we also can't buy like we did in the past.

Last summer we had to apply for an FFP exception to be able to spend. We're not getting out of this rut any time soon. We don't need to throw truck loads of millions on new players. We can improve by signing £20M players. We need to unearth talent, not always going after the biggest profile.  What FFP exception? Every year we get briefings saying we’re broke then we spend our usual 100-150m."
7285,Man United,That dembele red card for psg is… spicy 
7286,Man United,"Another 5 years of suffering is ahead.  I’d be happy to see us drop out of every cup this season if it meant top 4 and some CL money to help with a few transfers next year. Nah, won't be that long IF Ashworth and co get transfers right. Should be getting top 4 next season and then kick on from there."
7287,Man United,"It’s not like sporting changed the way they play so soon but they are getting destroyed by arsenal. Are we sure that Amorim ball really works against top premier league teams? Are you being serious or just trying to get a reaction. What a ridiculous take, Sporting just beat City 4-1 What a take…. They didn’t just beat city 4-1 with him managing…. Seriously delete this, it’s embarrassing! 

Edit: it’s even more embarrassing the reply’s by here trying to say City aren’t a top PL side. They’re still 2nd in the league and have won back to back to back titles. Some people are just hoping the manager fails seemingly  You're saying Amorim ball doesn't work because the team he left 2 weeks ago are losing without him? 

Baffling take. https://preview.redd.it/746wjdte9b3e1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=39d8770cc7829e314198bd178f7610ac30c60aa9 True, it’s not like Sporting drastically changed their style, but getting destroyed 5-1 by Arsenal is a worrying sign. While I don’t want to jump the gun, it just feels worrying. If the team’s early goal is to first reach Sporting’s level, is it around that level we’ll be in two years? After giving Amorim time to implement his tactics and squad changes, ending up like sporting and losing big to Arsenal/Liverpool/City? Hopefully, it doesn’t turn out that way"
7288,Man United,"Not seen it mentioned much but I thought Zirkzee looked good in the 10 role. Clearly more his position than up front. I'm surprised you feel like this. Feels like we watched different games. I agree it was a better performance than his previous one's, however, he misplaced so many passes losing us possession, so he has alot of improvement to do and we have to be patient with him"
7289,Man United,"It’s a combination of tactical familiarity and personnel. Also remember players learn at different rates, and some may not be suitable for our setup at all. It seems players Amad, Mount and Mazraoui have learned a lot quicker. Mount I can understand because he has played in a 3-4-3 before. "
7290,Man United,"Their CBs are so brave with the ball. We need Licha and Yoro back ASAP. Licha I understand, but how do you know Yoro is good on the ball"
7291,Man United,I stopped watching it a few years ago. Reminds me how awful we are watching teams actually play good attacking football. 
7292,Man United,Yeah but don't worry at least you can now pay £132 a pop for the privilege of taking a child to watch a shit team miles off the good ones 👍🏻 That money is obscene to take your kid to a game
7293,Man United,"Well, every single one of our rivals is there playing well.  Meanwhile, we can't score goals or play football properly.  We've sacked and hired another new manager.  We are in the bottom half of the league. We've only won 1 europa league match out of 4.  Makes me sad watching the Champions League. "
7294,Man United,That was fkn beautiful Atleast Feyenoord can bring a smile to my face after that Sporting game 😭
7295,Man United,This is some crazy UCL comebacks 💀 
7296,Man United,I hope it works out as well or better 
7297,Man United,STAY HUMBLE! 
7298,Man United,Page not found 404 
7299,Man United,"I feel winning EL feels more probable than a top 4 spot in the prem, but I doubt either happens "
7300,Man United,They'll spend another 180 million in January and it'll go underreported like always. Miraculous recovery 
7301,Man United,Thank you for the sacrifice. 
7302,Man United,Give with one hand and take with the other. 
7303,Man United,"we spent €75m on a 20 y/o striker who had 9 league goals, hojlund should’ve been around £35m at most. he also should’ve been brought in under an experienced striker so he could actually develop. dumb and dumber splashing £60m with the hope he can be our main number 9 and suddenly tear up the prem when he didn’t even tear up the italian league was just idiotic. murtough madness though 🔥 

at least gyökeres is a proven goal scorer and one of the most inform players in the world. Gyökeres can score twice the amount of Højlunds career goals in 2024 alone.

Gyökeres has scored as many goals since the season started that Højlund has scored in his entire career. Sure it’s the portugese league but he’s doing really well for his country as well. I disagree with you. I am so sick and tired of us just throwing money at players. We have a player that amorim can develop, just like he developed majority of the sporting players including the Gyokeres that you are on about.


We cannot replace the who squad with £70M players, we need to improve our own Hojlund was overpriced but he is closer to the type of signing we should be making than gyokeres. 27 year old established superstars only make sense for teams that are close to winning titles, we’re nowhere near that level"
7304,Man United,"What does ‘two seasons ago’ have to do with anything? The man has scored 80 goals since then. Isn’t even more? He’s on 33 already just this season. 

Yes this season. The fact is that, he was improved and developed to what he is now. 2 seasons ago, he was not this good, he would not have been linked with us. We should be improving our own striker who we spent so much on. Not pissing up another £70M. I'm sick and tired of us just going to buy the shiniest toy out that we can remotely thrown the most money at"
7305,Man United,"Don't worry, Gyökeres rumours are far off the mark "
7306,Man United,That the problem with UTD hierarchy we are not a club which buy to develop especially a £70+M player.We need a striker who is already complete and just develop our academy players. 
7307,Man United,"I’ve seen nothing from Rasmus to suggest he’s going to make it for us. Liam Delap was the best forward on the pitch on Sunday. You are absolutely being ridiculous comparing Delap to Rasmus. Sometimes I wonder how some of you guys can be man utd fans when all you do is put our own players down.


Delap cannot lace Rasmus' boots just to clarify to you. Yes, Rasmus is in poor form this season. The game you on about was Amorim's first game in a season which has been our worst in history by some distance, and Ipswich's best in recent memory. 


I really hope Amorim can give these players confidence and help them improve to put some of you fans to shame"
7308,Man United,"Mentality is not enough. If you want both talent and mentality, that'll cost you about as much as the usual 60 mil players we buy. We need to choose better. "
7309,Man United,We need to find the cohesive 11 and build based on that. 
7310,Man United,"True but I also don’t think big fees should be knocked because of incompetence. Utd of old paid big fees and top teams now still do, but when done competently, you get what you pay for - world class players. Paying world class fees for potential is incredibly stupid though and should never happen again. But like you allude to, there are very very few players worth more than 25m, and we keep finding players that aren’t yet paying 40+. Isidor for Sunderland is better than half the strikers we have or are linked with including I suspect a certain Swede in Portugal. "
7311,Man United,I think there are different types of fitness. Players could have good fitness to run long distances at a slow pace but not the fitness to make multiple sprints. Also it's an easy thing for any new manager to say to shift the blame on the previous guy and buy some time. 
7312,Man United,"Unfortunately, so are we. "
7313,Man United,Yup if anyone (and I mean anyone) can't fit his system then they can fuck off 
7314,Man United,"Please pause on the “his team” bit. No offence but we are not doing that shite anymore nor should we. If he wants a certain player profile, let the recruitment guys sort it out and he should focus on coaching. If certain players don’t fit his profile, he should pass it onto the directors and let them sort it out. We don’t need him acting like a superman manager, he should be the head coach and coach That's what I mean by his team. I'm not suggesting he buy specific player names that he wants, but specific profiles. 


And so far, all indications are that he gives the recruitment team the profiles he wants and that's it. For example, Romano who seems to have good links to Amorim has reported 2 things;
1. Amorim has asked for players with more intensity.
2. Amorim has asked for a left back.


I think that's fair, he is telling you the profiles, leaving it to the recruitment team to do the rest, I am happy with that."
7315,Man United,"I can't stand Arsenal I really want a Sporting comeback rn, Vamos!

Edit: well, idk if that is happening now."
7316,Man United,Blokes on the tap up 
7317,Man United,PSG is over. They have just won one game in CL this year; 1-0 win over Girona. Luis Enrique to city in one year 🤣
7318,Man United,Gotta feel bad for them 
7319,Man United,All back to Stockport. They're doing okay. 
7320,Man United,"I was confused by what you meant but when i checked i genuinely shouted. Last i saw they were 3-0 up Yeah same it’s a crazy result especially at home, Peps head is gonna be smoking."
7321,Man United,"Decent apology. Probably wasnt exactly necessary but seems heartfelt It's not even his fault anyway, Sky love doing shit like this. They love bringing people over to be all pally pally with the pundits whether it be celebs or ex players. 

If it was some random bloke you know they'd have had someone there to not interrupt but Sky want shit like this to go viral so they let it happen. Not Ed Sheeran's fault or any of the punditry, it's just an intentional thing by Sky for clicks. I'll respect anyone's apology when they can admit they were a bellend It seems a tendency now to make United coach life a reality show. The man doesn't have time to train properly but yet has to make 30% of his time to the press and so called legends! That's united one of main problems. Probably wasn't heartfelt to be honest and he probably only did it because it felt necessary. 

It's easy enough to not barge into someone telecasting something if you aren't just attention seeking ."
7322,Man United,"The same people saying this is a shit apology would be saying it's disingenuous PR nonsense if it was a cookie-cutter statement. At least this feels like he actually wrote it I can’t stand Ed Sheeran but think this is a good apology. It’s informal and obviously written by him personally. He acknowledges it wasn’t the thing to do. End of. Good apology in my book. Yeah. Use of ""bellend"" confirmed it. But there's an implied criticism towards Amorim. A proper apology would be him simply saying sorry for interrupting a live broadcast and taking responsibility for his own actions."
7323,Man United,"Eh, not that deep in my opinion. Think just bad timing but it happens, can see there was no ill intent Yeah not sure why everyone’s acting the way they are it’s not deep at all"
7324,Man United,Fair enough 
7325,Man United,"Amorim: 'Weren't you in Game of Thrones?'

Ed: 'We don't talk about that' Doubt that he regrets doing it Hey you're that 'actor' fella'"
7326,Man United,"An Overblown nothing event The Overblown is brought to you by Sky Bet But Amorim was furious /s I don’t think Amorim would actually have been offended enough to warrant an apology, but it was a douchey thing to do from Ed Sheeran so fair play to him for apologising."
7327,Man United,Interrupting someone is one of his bad habits I guess 🤷 Might have lead to a late night Nobody realizes what you did there Lovely stuff. just like stealing others music
7328,Man United,"Fair enough, more shame to Sky for not getting on top of the situation and just letting him walk up like that Sky probably loved it, knew it would make news"
7329,Man United,"Say it Ed that you're in love with Ruben.





Ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah

I'm in love with you beardy "
7330,Man United,"You're still a bellend to me, Ed x "
7331,Man United,"Didn’t realise they were interviewing, what with all the camera lights on, the United Manager there and all talking into microphones. Do me a favour!

Jamie Redknapp should’ve been shipped out with Keys and Gray too. Massive bellend They were probably standing around chatting and waiting to go live for some period of time, and then started their interview which is styled as... standing around chatting. Boohoo."
7332,Man United,"This was actually needed because Amorim said he wants to do less media. So now we can just use this as a reason why when Sky requests access to Amorim. ""Maybe should have thought about bringing a celebrity on when Ruben took his time to speak with your pundits"" "
7333,Man United,He's right about one thing - he is a bellend 
7334,Man United,"Sky sports should apologise to Amorim. 
He must be thinking this country’s media is a joke So he'd be correct? Amorim wouldn't be wrong"
7335,Man United,"It was stupid and there’s no way he didn’t realize there was an interview going on but I’d bet sky told him to go over there at that moment. Yeah think it might be that, sky said come over and he didn't realise it was live Chances are he had closer to a dozen than none, so I don't blame him for not realising."
7336,Man United,"Sky should be apologising for still employing Redknapp. Shite player, even worse pundit. "
7337,Man United,"Nah, I don't buy he was unaware "
7338,Man United,"I guess the camera, and the people holding the mics forming a semi arc in front of the camera, wasn't enough of a give. "
7339,Man United,"Ireland is still waiting for an apology for ""Galway Girl"". "
7340,Man United,"Big main character energy to just approach a live broadcast to say hello to one of the presenters. Definite bellend but who cares really. He was pissed probably Sky probably asked him to go over Honest to god, who would want to be in the limelight. I don't listen to any of his music or really care about him whatsoever but for someone who is a megastar he seems pretty genuine and not narcissistic like you're implying. 

It annoyed me at the time because I was trying to listen to Amorim but berating him a day later just seems crazy to me. Give over"
7341,Man United,People are offended over... checks notes... someone accidentally interrupting an interview? 
7342,Man United,Did Sheeran really write this or did he simply plagiarise an apology written by another artist? 
7343,Man United,Link to the interview: https://www.skysports.com/football/video/11095/13260231/ruben-amorim-post-match-interview-in-full-our-system-isnt-a-concern 
7344,Man United,It’s not that deep but then sports fans overblow everything 
7345,Man United,"Bellend move as there was clearly an interview going on. Disrespectful but as he said, life goes on "
7346,Man United,"Stupid twat, what did he think he was doing, have a social chat? "
7347,Man United,He is a gigantic bellend. 
7348,Man United,How did this even warrant an apology... 
7349,Man United,Good on Egg. I abhor his music but he’s a good egg. 
7350,Man United,"""didn't actually realise"" "
7351,Man United,At least you could tell he wrote it himself 
7352,Man United,"Ofc he knew, there are media people around to warn him etc. Bro wanted more attention, but nice of him to apologise "
7353,Man United,"‘If’. Fuck off you little prick, you definitely offended me. To be fair I’m joking but, at the same time, I have to admit while watching it I was irrationally angry lol "
7354,Man United,He’s apologised at least and he’s right he is a bellend 
7355,Man United,Football is becoming a circus 
7356,Man United,"An event that doesn't matter at all. No need to apologise for anything, Sky love bringing random people in. And it atleast feels written personally. 

But don't say you didn't realise he was being interviewed, anyone can tell he was, and Ed Sheeran has had enough interviews himself to know too I reckon Ed’s at least 4 pints in, so it’s an easy mistake to make when you’re half cut. Perhaps he just clocked Jamie, who he wanted to say hi and bye to, didn’t clock Amorim and just thought Kelly and the pundits were covering the game more generally."
7357,Man United,"""But life goes on""

Way to ruin an apology He’s not wrong is he? He did something rude, he apologised but it’s not as if someone died, the reaction to it has been a bit over the top tbh Comments like this are why celebrities have sterile PR companies doing their social media.

It's a perfectly fine apology. Its more just that he cant do anything to undo it. Life will go on He didn't even do anything worth apologizing.. It was an honest error and he apologized without being asked.. Yeah, it does. In poor taste, but the man apologised. Life goes on. [deleted]"
7358,Man United,Still a bellend. 
7359,Man United,Fair play. 
7360,Man United,"That's nice of him to say, we move on. I think it's somewhere between a complete non issue and Sky's fault anyway. "
7361,Man United,"Ed Sheeran seems like a genuine dude all around. He doesn't hang out in the wrong crowds either, seemingly. It's kinda difficult living a normal life while being an A-lister celebrity but he does make a pretty good attempt at it. "
7362,Man United,He’s should apologise to all of us! I pay £40 a months for Sky Sports! I don’t need to hear that clown’s opinion on anything. 
7363,Man United,"He had no need to be on the pitch, he knows how the media works. Next he’ll be doing commentary like that Gallagher twat "
7364,Man United,"Amorim just thought he was one of the disableds...True story my late Mother who was disabled (polio) went to a Utd v Liverpool game in the 80's, Sammy Lee was being substituted on and she said ""Aww that's nice they're letting a down syndrome kid dress up and come on the pitch"".. "
7365,Man United,"I hate these conditional apologies. Just say sorry without any IFs Yes, that should be his next shitty ballad!"
7366,Man United,"Wasn't expecting an apology, wasn't that big a deal, good of him to do so. "
7367,Man United,"This is stupid. Someone let him on set. There’s a team of people whose job is to tell people they’re live and not let people through.

He also did look way to casual to know they’re live haha "
7368,Man United,The real apology should be for WANTING to talk to Jamie 
7369,Man United,He had no business being there. 
7370,Man United,They are literally interviewing Amorim when he interrupts and now says he didn’t know they were interviewing him. Big fat lier. 
7371,Man United,Obvz 
7372,Man United,"I don’t even know what happened, that’s how much I care  "
7373,Man United,"Just me or does it feel completely disingenous? ""Obvz feel a bit of a bellend but life goes on"" lmao I live near a recording studio (5min walk) & he's been in the local pubs so he's known around the area. He doesn't look for attention so probably didn't realise he was causing a scene.

Edit: feels genuine. I think he actively tries to avoid attention tbh."
7374,Man United,It was cringy af. Muggy twat 
7375,Man United,"I don’t blame Ed, I blame Sky sports. "
7376,Man United,Everything before the word but is horse shit 
7377,Man United,Feels attention seeking tbh no need to make this 
7378,Man United,When you apologise properly you address how those people might be affected not how YOU feel about it. It doesn’t matter that you didn’t realise what was going on. You admin you should realise. 
7379,Man United,Ed Sheeran out! 
7380,Man United,[removed] [removed]
7381,Man United,Had to look up bellend. Wow. 
7382,Man United,Muppet

7384,Man United,Tables turned if Ruben attends Sheeran’s next concert at Wembley.  
7385,Man United,Good 
7386,Man United,He knew. It’s all about exposure. lol you’re saying a fella who can fill out a whole stadium for his own concert needs exposure? Cmon mate… 🤦‍♂️ Ed Sheeran doesn't need the exposure of interrupting a post match interview lmao Wtf are you waffling about lmao
7387,Man United,I don’t really see the issue with it. There’s always people gate crashing interviews during post game pitch side interviews and at least he apologised for it. 
7388,Man United,"Wow, what a shit apology. Actually name-checking Amorim in the post making him look like the arsehole.

He was an entitled twat who interrupted a live broadcast. He annoyed plenty more people than Amorim. It’s not that deep mate, calm down How is that your takeaway from that lol?"
7389,Man United,I think you mean “Mr Amorim” 
7390,Man United,"Ipswich is his personal ego trip. Made a tonne of money through his crappy paint by numbers love songs and now uses it as his personal advertising platform. Never understood the hype around him. He’s been an Ipswich fan all his life. You’d probably be slagging him off for supporting a big club like the rest of us do if it were the other way round. You like a musician or you don't

Trying to understand why someone else does not hate the music you hate is a waste of time 

You're not a god's favourite child that everybody else would hype exactly the same things you hype You sir, are as they say, ""well jel"""
7391,Man United,Absolute tossa 
7392,Man United,"What does it really mean when you admit you are a bellend but then day ""but life goes on""? "
7393,Man United,[deleted] You use surname as respectful thing.
7394,Man United,"United just spin pr to deflect from performances, talking about rashford and his chains watching nba during his free time such “derogatory” activity from the media that is made up of Gary Neville. Until you guys reset nothing will change Stop getting giddy because you didn't bottle it for once."
7395,Man United,Nothing to apologise for. 
7396,Man United,Much ado about nothing. 
7397,Man United,"[deleted] Wow. If I knew that before! He gets paid to sing? My god. 

My estimation of Ed Sheeran as a man just fucking plummeted. How is that an immoral thing to do ? Singer performing for money. So immoral. So basically if you are talented and some guy who is rich asks you to showcase your talent for a hefty price or whatever, will you not do it? Who do you work for, out of interest?

I wonder if they have an dubious business practices that you'd like to highlight, in your upcoming resignation letter? What a stupid take Out of everything one can critise or dislike him for, I don't think him taking singing gigs from billionares are that high on the list This is the dumbest comment I've ever read. Get a grip"
7398,Man United,Should do a concert for the untied players every week until their games improve

7401,Man United,"Do Ipswich fans consider the focus on him cringeworthy at all? There is more attention on him than the manager or the team.

Let the team enjoy the moment rather than sticking your fucking melon in almost every shot. "
7402,Man United,"City have potato head, we have ginge. Amazing. "
7403,Man United,An apology where you refer to the person you are apologising to   by using their second name only. 
7404,Man United,"It's not even his fault anyway, Sky love doing shit like this. They love bringing people over to be all pally pally with the pundits whether it be celebs or ex players. 

If it was some random bloke you know they'd have had someone there to not interrupt but Sky want shit like this to go viral so they let it happen. Not Ed Sheeran's fault or any of the punditry, it's just an intentional thing by Sky for clicks. It’s not just Sky, TNT took the ridiculous step of having Noel Gallagher as co-comms for a CL match. I mean come on. Didn't they bring in Stormzy for a post-match interview at Old Trafford at one point? (which was actually quite a funny one)

Edit: [Found it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfLbbzZfYiE) Even Kelly Cates seemed a bit pissed off with it too to be fair, she wasn't really having any of it. If it was just a random bloke you bet he'd have been on his way to Gitmo by now This so much man. Like if he's trundling through they should have an assistant there to ask him to hold up and wait for a bit. He ended up popping up because he went for it and they let him. If one of the club's kit men or whatever was approaching you'd be sure as hell they'd have been stopped beforehand.

Ed was probably just bouncing about on good vibes post-game and didn't think about if it was good or bad form to crash the interview. It's very much on Sky."
7405,Man United,I'll respect anyone's apology when they can admit they were a bellend 
7406,Man United,"It seems a tendency now to make United coach life a reality show. The man doesn't have time to train properly but yet has to make 30% of his time to the press and so called legends! That's united one of main problems. Only problem I have with what you said is ""so called legends"". 

Neville is a legend by any stretch of the imagination. Best RB in the league for at least 5 years, 600 appearances, club captain, youth academy product and winner of more honours than almost any of our players."
7407,Man United,"Probably wasn't heartfelt to be honest and he probably only did it because it felt necessary.

It's crazy that people are so mad about it. God forbid any of us were celebrities. He made a harmless miscalculation and people are calling him all sorts. I can't stand his music, have nothing against the guy His music isn't my cup of tea, but he seems like a really nice guy tbh Is there any particular reason don't like him? His music isn't for me, but he's always seemed very nice, and willing to make fun of himself. Imagine not liking ed sheeran damn"
7409,Man United,Good apology in my book. 
7410,Man United,"Yeah. Use of ""bellend"" confirmed it. "
7411,Man United,"But there's an implied criticism towards Amorim. A proper apology would be him simply saying sorry for interrupting a live broadcast and taking responsibility for his own actions. You're taking this far too seriously.  It's not really implied criticism. That would be ""apologies if Amorim was offended.""

Sheeran is a bellend, as he owns up to, but he at least put the emphasis on his actions, not on Amorim's response to them.

As it is, I'm sure Amorim is just pissed at the British media circus, and this week has likely been a rude awakening for the levels of desperate ""pick me"" energy he'll have to deal with from supposed journalists and TV networks who want to get a scoop on him. “Sorry if I offended you” is very different to “sorry if you’re offended”. Not that deep Give over, he barely did anything. It's such a non-event it's unreal."
7412,Man United,Yeah not sure why everyone’s acting the way they are it’s not deep at all Honestly the comments about it being “cringe” are just embarrassing. Just young male Redditors who don’t like Ed Sheeran who think they’re cool by looking down on him being cringe. Because it did seem to upset Ruben a bit. He’s giving his first interview. They’re grilling him and boom heres ed Sheeran. But disrespectful to the guy. But I do like Ed more after he apologized when he didn’t have to.
7413,Man United,Doubt that he regrets doing it I could've been a beheaded slave in Game of Thrones and I'd still be proud to have done it
7414,Man United,Hey you're that 'actor' fella' 
7415,Man United,"The Overblown is brought to you by Sky Bet And Huel, obviously. And special black Friday deal."
7416,Man United,"But Amorim was furious /s /s is noted OP

Honestly felt as if Reuben cannot give more of a fuck about anything right now. His frustration yesterday was palpable. He'd have tombstoned someone if he could just to see us win and play well. He is so invested in the team, I doubt he cares about anything else."
7417,Man United,"I don’t think Amorim would actually have been offended enough to warrant an apology, but it was a douchey thing to do from Ed Sheeran so fair play to him for apologising. "
7418,Man United,Might have lead to a late night 
7419,Man United,Nobody realizes what you did there Very obscure reference from an unknown artist
7420,Man United,Lovely stuff.

7422,Man United,"What’s with everyone focusing on headline and not listening to the podcast. They actually did a good fair analysis of the match. Carl even said that Rasmus should start next match instead of Rashford. Because it’s easier to be miserable on Reddit. That headline has irked me too too much to want to listen to this episode. Yes, I am judging a podcast by its title."
7423,Man United,"Igniting literally means ‘starting’. Considering he scored after 81 seconds or however long it was, the term ‘ignites’ is pretty fitting "
7424,Man United,"Marcus Rashford was on the scoresheet after just 81 seconds of Ruben Amorim's first game as Manchester United manager, rounding off a very encouraging move after good work from Amad Diallo.

Unfortuntately(not my typo), that was as good as it got with Kieran McKenna's Ipswich fighting back to earn a point; perhaps a lesson for the Portuguese on exactly how competitive the Premier League is. 

There was plenty to digest from that game, from positional play to passion and spectacular saves, and there's likely to be a fair bit more to come over the next few matches starting with a fascinating Bodo Glimt side on Thursday night. "
7425,Man United,"Rashford was anything but igniting. His lack of effort is INSANE if you consider how long he’s been a professional footballer.

Amorim isn’t scared of benching/sending out big name players. Think he’ll be out the door come next summer unless he adapts. I was expecting to see some effort given the arrival of the new manager, but apart from the goal, what he showed was absolutely shambolic. If a new manager can't light a fire up his arse, I'm not sure what will I feel as if Garnacho and Rashy needs to be benched. Give Mount and Zirkzee a go instead. Mount and dialo need to be given a run in the 10 roles Fucking hell, I don't know if I'm crazy or something. I don't really watch United but how can people be saying this after watching that game? Lack of effort? The man was trying his best in a game where nobody really knew which spaces of the pitch they should be stepping on, he simply can't play alone as a link up striker with his back facing the goal, trying to hold of players, that's not his qualities as a player. 

Maybe I'm just too fucking stupid to see what everyone else is saying, I mean I don't really watch United but from that game, lack of effort is not what I would call what happened. I don’t think he’s fit. And hasn’t been for 2 years. He looks brittle, rigid, and just quiet in the pitch. I would wager he’s got some sort of chronic hip/back problem and is playing on injections Unfortunately, Ole has made Rashford thinks that he has made it. He’s a superstar now. If only Ruben has that young Marcus that debut under LvG. Do you know the meaning of igniting? Cause it would seem to me that you do not. Hopefully, Amorim sounds really tough on his philosophy. If you don’t track back or play by his rules he will bench you.

I can see Rashford falling out of favour and Mount being our POTY if he can keep fit. Ignites is not the wrong word tho, he did “start the fire” by scoring he just…. Idk man he just seems like he can’t be bothered, like he started the fire but he has not fire in him? I think I took this metaphor as far as it can go lol. I hate judging players, you never know what’s going on. My dad kept saying Rashy was acting satisfied after he scored one so he must feel like he did his part, he seemed apathetic. I’m not sure that’s it. But yeah I agree 100% with everything you said, he frustrates me so much, I love him, but he makes me so mad. Guy is mediocre, weak mind and lazy. Idk why he still at this club, if we are to aim higher, he need to go ,period."
7426,Man United,Imagine if Rashford actually stays. The meltdown on this subreddit is going to be insane and I’m all for it. 
7427,Man United,"Rashford is meh, apart from the goal. The goal is more than anybody else did apart from Onana."
7428,Man United,Is this Rashford’s PR in action because if anything the igniting was done majorly by Amad for the attacks and Onana saved our blushes. He literally started the match with a goal. Then the rest of the match happened. It’s how they discuss it in the podcast. Maybe just listen to whole episode instead of talking out of your arse? I was about to make the exact same point. The man has some real good PR guys behind him promoting him. I am kinda worried for Amorim. Rashford had a little scuffle behind the scenes with Ole. He stopped running under EtH. I can't remember Rashford's performance during the last few months of Jose tenure.
7429,Man United,"I don't think Rashford is as bad as people make out, however, he's 27 now and showing no signs of getting better. He definitely should be gone next summer - for his sake too, I think he needs a fresh start. The problem isn’t his talent, it’s his workrate and mentality. When things aren’t going good he sulks and doesn’t track back. 

Can’t have players like that in a team."
7430,Man United,"https://preview.redd.it/xhogvgcv283e1.jpeg?width=979&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4c84ac936a85fa27c3bfab7e7115ed5584d6bd0

I really want to see this team in next match fed up with rash and others except maz. "
7431,Man United,"I think the lads are a tad too harsh on new signings while giving players who have been here underperforming for longer get kind of skimmed over because we are just use to them underperforming.  Which would be fine, but then at the end they talk about how Amorim needs to improve the players he's got. "
7432,Man United,Only thing Rashford ignited was more criticism of his efforts. There’s something gone off with him and he hasn’t tried for a full 90 in who knows how long 
7433,Man United,Rashford ignites the hate of fans maybe 
7434,Man United,This dude needs to be shipped off to PSG fast 
7435,Man United,"Id sell him in the summer, he's been stealing a living for to long. "
7436,Man United,The only positive about rashford right now is the possibility of ffp from him during the summer. Feel like we have been waiting for his 8th resurgence already. 
7437,Man United,"This title feels like an ineffective title for a podcast. Anyone who cares enough to listen already knows this so it feels slightly random. How so? The story of the match, in their telling, was that it was an explosive start with a performance that fell flat soon after."
7438,Man United,"Languishing mid table, struggling to score goals - dangerous time to experiment with a new system, feel like this could go horribly wrong

Only have to drop a few places and it's a full blown crisis

Feel like Ruud ball was what we needed till end of season - the players looked rejuvenated under it and we were suddenly scoring again Can’t play Leicester every week"
7439,Man United,"Why do British press cover their washed out players and coaches but ruthless against non English people? Fucking anti immigrant activists Jesus christ, tell me you never listened to Talk of the Devils without telling me

Couldn't get a less anti-immigration bunch if you tried. One has lived Barcelona for years and another lived in Amsterdam and has a Dutch missus.

Try harder mate Did you forget that the most mocked and ridiculed player in football for 2 years was an Englishman named Harry Maguire? The other most scrutinized player is probably Rashford. 

But yeah Wtf"

7444,Man United,"I feel as if Garnacho and Rashy needs to be benched. Give Mount and Zirkzee a go instead. Zirkzee's place is on the bench and he should be shipped for loan next January. Never seen a player so limited like him. At least Antony can run, despite like a headless chicken Garnacho at least runs, and maybe he can be trained. I've lost hope with Rashford, the amount if times he was just walking around pissed me off."

Then I’ll join you on the stupid bench because I agree. I think his lackluster form has made him the new target du jour but it always goes too far in the comments.

I’ll also add that many are misinterpreting the episode title. He ignited the match with an early goal. That’s all it means. >Maybe I'm just too fucking stupid

If anything, you get plenty of British 'expats\` who are rabidly bigoted against various races and ethnicities while living in a foreign country (often quite loudly so).

Garnacho reads the game well, gets himself in good opportunities and works hard, he's just too selfish and a bit slow on decision making when he's not going for goal.

But for all people are moaning about him, Garnacho on poor form / in need of rotation is still our top scorer.

I get why people think Amad is the second coming of Christ but I'm still massively excited for both - Rashy needs to make one of these roles behind the striker his own or he'll be gone soon as much as Ive loved him over the years."

I find it baffling that criticism of Rashford is often met with this response, i.e. that it's people jumping on the bandwagon to pile on him for some recent poor form. 

It's not poor form. He's been way below standard for years now. His attitude, effort, decision-making, passing, and general performances have been shockingly bad for a long time. Every now and then, he has a flash of form, but it's never in the context of a team performance. It's always individual moments, which we all know are fleeting. 

He is paid as though he is one of the best players in the world, but the simple fact is he is nowhere near good enough. He has been shite for Utd for far more time than he has been good."

After that Amad didn't see much of the game because he was marked out and doubled upon so not sure what planet you're on because they targeted the threat until the last 10 mins where he had another spell of an impact when the game opened up and both teams were going for a winner.

Amazing that no one mentions Eddie Howe's name when they talk about vulnerable managers. Apparently mid-table is okay for a financially doped sportswashing project now. How is it Newcastle have dropped off so badly but it just isn’t mentioned? Thought Howe was the next Fergie and Newcastle were the plucky underdogs They sent a photo of a bonesaw to all the journalists. Helps when your owners also own half the media The English media are not allowed to criticise English managers. That's why even in a season where Ole finished above Lampard, and we finished 3rd, there were still questions about Ole's job, the identity of the team, blah blah blah."

7512,Man United,Why do ex players always get posted when they score a goal? The fanbase is sentimental for mediocre players Why do always some people complain when stuff about old players is posted? Do they hate fun or something?
7513,Man United,Don’t forget his vital goal in the 9-0 close-contest against Southampton at OT. 
7514,Man United,"How is it Newcastle have dropped off so badly but it just isn’t mentioned? Thought Howe was the next Fergie and Newcastle were the plucky underdogs They sagged earlier in the season but because they won the last 3 games before the international break including against Chelsea and Arsenal it went quiet. It’ll come up big again now. 

Plus I think it’s just a season with a lot of ups and downs, the only team that’s consistent is Liverpool - everyone else is in crisis every other week. Tbf I think most people outside their fanbase realised the 3rd place season was a bit of a fluke and now teams have realised how to play against them"
7515,Man United,They sent a photo of a bonesaw to all the journalists. 
7516,Man United,Helps when your owners also own half the media 
7517,Man United,"The English media are not allowed to criticise English managers. That's why even in a season where Ole finished above Lampard, and we finished 3rd, there were still questions about Ole's job, the identity of the team, blah blah blah. "
7518,Man United,"... United *Had* to go and do it, eh? Missed the joke there lol."
7519,Man United,He’s just waking up from the confusion of whatever Erik was hoping he’d do. 
7520,Man United,"yeah, me too.. "
7521,Man United,Why do always some people complain when stuff about old players is posted? Do they hate fun or something?

7525,Man United,Missed the joke there lol. 
7526,Man United,"Maz has been such a bargain Think everyone agreed that the only question mark about Maz was his fitness/injury history. Long as he stays healthy he's excellent and quite possibly the signing of the season for every such bargain, we have a deal with devil for antony like players"
7527,Man United,"Garnacho dribbles it until it’s dead pretty much every time. So he progresses a lot through dribbling but then he loses the ball. So he had zero progression through passing but good dribbling progression. Mans needs to learn to look at his teammates instead of the ball all the bloody time. I agree. But to play devils advocate, the two 10s in Amorims system are often encouraged to carry the ball and run at defenders. He just needs to make better decisions when releasing the ball. Imo progression should only count if it actually mattered.. moving forward 5-10 meters to just give it to the opposition and then they move forward 20 is not in any way positive.
Same a pass that just leads to the other player getting butchered with no way of handling it should also not count. But guess that would be harder to do and more subjective He tends to run towards the flanks and doesn't look for teammates. He and Rashy must improve. He had 1 forward pass out of 27. 0 chances created, 0 big chances created.  He’s too much of a one tricky pony. He’d be a much bigger threat if he works on his crossing and general playmaking. Tbf the two times I can think of it seemed like Garnacho got tackled when he was trying to release Rashford on the square ball which is more credit to the defenders keeping pace to be able to take advantage of that split second slowing up to pass  This is how Rashford was at his age, hopefully he learns and adds to his game, which to be fair to him he's shown he's done this season just not more than he's done this bloody thing"
7528,Man United,"With Mazraoui and Diallo i thought the right side looked nice with the ball. Hope they can make that a consistent threat The problem in the last game is Amad just didn't get the ball in the correct areas. He had one touch in the opposition box in normal time and that was the assist. 


 The issue with him is that he's just not a wingback.  Now imagine Maz, Dalot and Amad (AM). That side could be technically wonderful."
7529,Man United,"eriksen and casemiro being so low is a huge reason why we struggled. Ugarte and Mainoo will take their place eventually. Casemiro is in danger, at least Eriksen can play 10. but also think the structure did not allow them to play progressive passes through the middle. I think Erikssen would have had decent numbers if he had options. Only progressive outlet we saw was through the WBs. Very curious how we will evolve and be able to play through middle in this structure."
7530,Man United,"Hutchinson looked so much better on the ball than our front three, combined 😅 That Evans Casemiro and Eriksen triangle he was up against is over 100yrs old. It's no surprise that Hutchinson faded after Shaw + Ugarte came on. He's a good player though. Very talented. Honestly, Hutchinson was a stand out player watching the game yesterday. Stood out more than anyone on Utd side"
7531,Man United,"be like Maz, he is a chill guy with the top right corner stat lol "
7532,Man United,"Mazraoui is elite. Also could handle pressure very well, you cannot press him he always find a way out. "
7533,Man United,Thought it was interesting that Amorim singled out how important Mazraoui is for his system. His press resistance is incredible and he seems to understand any system he plays in. Best bargain buy in the post SAF era for me. 
7534,Man United,"So so good. Be it off the right, left, or at center back he has to be in the team. I never doubted the quality, but I didn’t think he would be this good "
7535,Man United,Midfield was too slow especially in the 1st half 
7536,Man United,"Would love to see a comparison between halves, it’s clear why Bruno got moved further back in the second half so he could get more involved, because no-one else in midfield was doing _anything_. 

And there are still plenty of ‘fans’ here slating him for that game. "
7537,Man United,"You've still got some fans saying that they'd gladly get rid of Shaw. He didn't even start the game and yet his impact was clear to see. He's a top contender for those LCB/LWB spots. He's too good of a footballer when fit to be left out. Hes a world class player. Hes never fit and on bigh wages is prob why. Should transition to LCB full time imo, might help a bit with the injuries if he doesn’t have to bombing up and down the pitch constantly What good is a top contender if he can't play more than 30-35 games across comps all season. > You've still got some fans saying that they'd gladly get rid of Shaw.

Ya, because he's always injured lol. Your best ability is availability. He's a great player when fit, but history has proven you cannot count on him to be fit. Because we can't rely on our world class LB for more than 1/3 of a season it feels like. I'd rather a 7/10 for 50 games a season than a 9/10 for 25 games  The reason we should be looking to replace him is that you can’t depend on a player that’s only fit for about 20 games a season. It’s never had anything to do with his ability. Its the Pogba/Martial debate all over again... no body doubts the talent, its the fact that he's injured about 98% of the time so we never actually get to benefit from that talent. the problem lies in his fitness

dalot might be a mid player but his availability is the best quality, he hardly gets injured

shaw whenever he plays is world class but he hardly plays and when he is decently fit in a season (20/21 season or 22/23 season) he showed his class and those 2 were relatively successful seasons It’s like you are purposely missing the point just to push your own stupid narrative. People are saying to get rid of him because he is never fit, not because he is a bad player. Stop creating imaginary scenarios in your head."
7538,Man United,I'm most disappointed by Eriksen in this graph. He should really be further to the right. 
7539,Man United,"I’d actually love to see Mount where Garnacho was Mount would actually be better. Problem with Garnacho is he is still on that old counter-attack mentality, always anticipating for the long ball."
7540,Man United,"the problem with Garnacho is his decision-making! making bad decisions almost every time Which is the worrying part, because you can't dramatically improve a player's decision making by coaching."
7541,Man United,Top right Nouss 
7542,Man United,I'm hoping Shaw's injury woes can be reduced a bit by playing at LCB rather than LB. He's such a good player for us when fit it's actually kind of mental. 
7543,Man United,Mazraoui has been our best signing in terms of output and value ratio since Bruno. 
7544,Man United,"Garnacho needs to adapt. Bruno, Zirkzee and Mount looks better suited than him in the 10 position. He is in danger under Amorim, he better watch out. I actually think Garnacho should be sold for profit while his stock is still high. There’s a promising player in there no doubt, and if we are still playing three up top, there would still be time for him to grow and develop given the lack of competition. 

But there is now a change of formation and if he can’t spot a pass from the wings, then he doesn’t look like he would do well in one of the two #10 positions."
7545,Man United,"Is this per minute on the pitch or straight up numbers?

If it's the latter and Shaw is 4th with only 30-40 mins then the rest need to step up big time.

Also goes to why we have done so badly not having a left back for 3+ months "
7546,Man United,r/toprightMazraoui 
7547,Man United,All hail Ligt. 
7548,Man United,And this is why the importance of Shaw's return can't be understated. 
7549,Man United,r/toprightMaz 
7550,Man United,The fuck is a 0.75 progression via carry? 
7551,Man United,"Genuinely believe if we could clone him 10 times, a team full of Mazraouis would make top 4 easily, lol. Same with Shaw honestly. It's a shame the guy is never fit."
7552,Man United,Maz remains the best Ten’s signing for real 
7553,Man United,Cashford was so bad he didnt even fit the graph? 
7554,Man United,"Disappointing result but the second half was clearly much better once we got some deadweight off the pitch.

If the players cannot adapt then they must go, and I liked Amorim's substitutions. Hopefully, he can find his footing and figure out which players won't work by the time january rolls around "
7555,Man United,Super Hot take: I can see an experiment where Maz plays as a CCB. 
7556,Man United,"This graph has absolutely useless scales/axis. Looking at it, the scale used is either is so bad that it offends me, or that I am missing something fundamental and I feel utterly dumb. 

What does the numbers bloody mean? How the hell does Maz have 6.66 progression via pass. Is that passes total? Impossible as is one game. 6.66 metres? That's not a lot. Is even worse in carries? It can't be per half either. It probably per something seeing that Shaw is pretty high and he played like a third of the game. "
7557,Man United,Shaw being high despite being subbed on 
7558,Man United,I'm upset it took me so long to find Rashford on the chart 
7559,Man United,"God, it's so fucking hard to ration Shaw while he builds fitness when he pulls those figures while playing hardly any minutes. He's so perfect for Amorim. Hopefully Martinez is back soon so we can keep slowly building for Shaw. 

  
Also it's wild just how good the transfer for Mazraoui has been. "
7560,Man United,Shameful from Casemiro and Eriksen. 
7561,Man United,Maz’ understanding of the game is second to none. He stands out in a team with chronic decision making issues. 
7562,Man United,"We had one lovely move yesterday which broke down when Rashford had a heavy touch. Felt like it happened quite a lot yesterday, like to know how many times we surrendered possession when not under pressure "
7563,Man United,Garnacho had two great dribble chances but couldn't find anyone and got tackled. Marcus is just Marcus at this point. Delap and Omari looked incredible. 
7564,Man United,Where is Rashford? Forwards highest up the pitch playing in line with opponents CBs usually dont have oportunities to progress the ball.
7565,Man United,"Think everyone agreed that the only question mark about Maz was his fitness/injury history. Long as he stays healthy he's excellent and quite possibly the signing of the season Sort of disagree with you. I think loads of people underestimated how good and how intelligent he was as a footballer, especially his defensive abilities. I know people who bemoaned AWB leaving because they thought we would lose a lot of ability to shut down elite PL forwards in 1v1s. I genuinely can't think of one time Nous has been cooked defensively because his positioning is so out of this world it hardly ever gets to those 1v1 situations. Maz being injured would be absolutely fucking awful."
7566,Man United,"for every such bargain, we have a deal with devil for antony like players "
7567,Man United,Mans needs to learn to look at his teammates instead of the ball all the bloody time. Can't set up a shot if you're looking at a teammate
7568,Man United,"I agree. But to play devils advocate, the two 10s in Amorims system are often encouraged to carry the ball and run at defenders. He just needs to make better decisions when releasing the ball. Yeah that’s fair that the manager may well have said get the ball and run at them. But to run it dead pretty much every time? So many opportunities never became a goal scoring chance because he just doesn’t look up."

7570,Man United,He tends to run towards the flanks and doesn't look for teammates. He and Rashy must improve. It’s always been a bit odd to me because Rashford is rather good at passing and feeding. I feel this is something that he needs to be instructed to do. Whether it’s something he ultimately wants here is another matter.
7571,Man United,"He had 1 forward pass out of 27. 0 chances created, 0 big chances created.  "

Rashford was far better 😂😂😂😂. U mfs just lie on this app don’t u"

Its incredibly frustrating to watch him play. There is a good player in there, and we see at times, but damn he can't pass at all I'm looking forward to a Yoro , Maz, and Amad right side once Yoro is fit."

That's not much Eriksen has a defibrillator attached to his heart so he cannot get physical in any match which is why you always see him avoid physical challenges.

So many opportunities never became a goal scoring chance because he just doesn’t look up. I keep saying this, Garna will ONLY consider passing the ball when he feels he is in danger of losing it and looking bad or has no angle to shoot from (albeit he also attempts shots from absolutely ridiculous angles anyhow).

This is not hating on my part and also it's not because I don't believe that Garna is a talented guy, BUT he is definitely a player that either has some really bad habits he needs to shake off (watching the ball instead of scanning for team mates while on the move), or a selfishness that has gotten the better of him. I know there's this cliche about how selfishness is good for forwards, but I disagree. You need your forwards to be good decision makers, not greedy. In any given situation, you hate to be able to evaluate what option has the highest chance of resulting in a goal. If the odds for you being a goalscorer are pretty high (they don't need to be the highest of all possible options, but they should be pretty good), then by all means, go for the shot and be the hero. But if not, pass it and be a hero still. He its always one dribble too many with him."
7599,Man United,It’s always been a bit odd to me because Rashford is rather good at passing and feeding. I feel this is something that he needs to be instructed to do. Whether it’s something he ultimately wants here is another matter.

Didn't think it would cause issue"
7601,Man United,Rashford was far better .... okay. Did I say he wasn't?
7602,Man United,😂😂😂😂. U mfs just lie on this app don’t u What do you mean? Who lied? I interpreted the data from the graph and compared it to what I saw with my own eyes yesterday.

Its incredibly frustrating to watch him play. There is a good player in there, and we see at times, but damn he can't pass at all Yeah, he either just punts it into the first defender, or past the back post, or misplaces a simple pass... Frustrating. None of our fullbacks are capable of crossing. Shaw can string together a nice set of passes and one-twos tho. Agree. I’ve always believed there’s a monster in Dalot but he’s always needed some more specific coaching. I thought ETH was going to do that and I think positionally he improved, but his technical aspects are still the same. Given Rubén’s hands-on approach, I’m hoping he takes another leap."
7604,Man United,"I'm looking forward to a Yoro , Maz, and Amad right side once Yoro is fit. "

I hate this 'where would x play?', may the best man win and that's that. be it Martinez, Rashford or even Bruno. LCB as well, depth and competition is desperately needed here They can be backups of each other"
7613,Man United,I would argue that 30-35 games across all comps is a pretty good payoff. He gets to play the most important games of the season assuming they don’t all come at the same time. He is not getting even that and you will always be inconsistent with players like that. Get rid...
7614,Man United,"If the 25-game 9/10 LB is already in the club, then the key is to find a 7/10 or even 6/10 rotation LB who can let the 9/10 LB rest and give his best for the 25 more critical games. With sufficient rest, he might even be able to make it to 30-35 games a season.

7615,Man United,Actually pretty sure both guys put in a lot ot performances that made people doubt their talents. Shaw unlike pogba or martial has been consistent good when fit. You think you forgot horrid season which led to Jose stating that he has to make every decision for Shaw on the pitch
7616,Man United,You're coming across as seriously irritated. It's no use engaging with you any further 
7617,Man United,For God's sakes even Hojlund has more than him. How’s Rashford your focus here when our midfield pivot are that low? We have actual zombies in the middle of the park but the furthest man up the pitch is the problem.
7618,Man United,"It baffles me that out of all the ex Ajax/EtH players we got, why did we let the two cheapest ones (Gravenberch, Maz) go to Bayern? And in the case of Gravenberch, we missed 2 opportunities to get him Massively agree. If you think about that summer it was so so shambolic form recruitment. If our stupid muddled football structure had confirmed the ten Hag appointment earlier and were honest with ourselves about the player profiles we needed to play the football we claimed to want to play, there was a chance we could have got Maz and Onana in for free. I know both had issues at the end of their Ajax careers and Maz especially seems to have got through his injuries so maybe it's all worked out in the end. ETH had a hard on for FDJ and we ended up getting Mount lol Mazraoui AFAIK had agreed to join Bayern even before we'd confirmed EtH. Gravenberch we definitely missed out on both occasions  Purely speculation but unless they had release clauses they probably wouldn’t have been the cheapest ones if we’d gone for them before the INEOS revamp"
7619,Man United,"Yeah the way it works out is that Maz isn't as good a tackler as AWB, but the need to pull off a great tackle is arguably a consequence of bad positioning. I love the way Maz manages to make football look easy at times by just being in the right spot to intercept. "

7621,Man United,"I keep saying this, Garna will ONLY consider passing the ball when he feels he is in danger of losing it and looking bad or has no angle to shoot from (albeit he also attempts shots from absolutely ridiculous angles anyhow).

This is not hating on my part and also it's not because I don't believe that Garna is a talented guy, BUT he is definitely a player that either has some really bad habits he needs to shake off (watching the ball instead of scanning for team mates while on the move), or a selfishness that has gotten the better of him. I know there's this cliche about how selfishness is good for forwards, but I disagree. You need your forwards to be good decision makers, not greedy. In any given situation, you hate to be able to evaluate what option has the highest chance of resulting in a goal. If the odds for you being a goalscorer are pretty high (they don't need to be the highest of all possible options, but they should be pretty good), then by all means, go for the shot and be the hero. But if not, pass it and be a hero still. "
7622,Man United,"He its always one dribble too many with him. To be fair, he’s young and this is certainly something that can be coached into him as he develops. It always matters what’s being incentivized. Looking at Sporting play, and Gyokeres’ numbers, it was clear what was being incentivized. He’d have Hojlund’s numbers if Sporting’s number 10s obsessively progressed with a view to shoot on goal the way virtually all of our wingers continue to play."
7623,Man United,I'm not saying they're the exact same calm down mate 😂 like all young wingers he'd hold on to the ball too long trying to take on his man or release at the right time. Didn't think it would cause issue 
7624,Man United,.... okay. Did I say he wasn't? 
7625,Man United,What do you mean?

7627,Man United,"This is a good one. Players obviously not comfortable yet. Which is normal. They’re not confident they can do it, like Amorim said, they were overthinking. 

It’ll come with time"
7628,Man United,Mirror anyone? [https://streamff.co/v/fe4ec5b5](https://streamff.co/v/fe4ec5b5)
7629,Man United,"Imagine what Amorim will accomplish with time and better suited players. 

That sporting fan that posted the analysis was correct, our two central midfielders need to be enforcers with great stamina and intensity. We definitely need to target CM in the summer too. Imo it’s the biggest priority alongside LWB unless Shaw and Malacia can both stay fit for the rest of the season (very doubtful). 

As it stands we only have Ugarte and Mainoo as potential long term options there. Maybe Bruno can be a makeshift 8 in certain games or situations but Idk if he can really adapt and become a full time starter there. Casemiro and Eriksen both clearly lack the intensity to suit the system so they can’t be counted as anything more than some extra bodies. We also have no clue if anyone from the academy like Collyer can step up or not. Bet he'd have made good use of McSauce I think we should 100% be after Ederson from Atalanta he would be perfect Yeah. We can look at how Camavinga did for Madrid yesterday, for their first goal. On top of stamina and intensity, I would also like to add something, that has been missing in our midfield for a long time, composure."
7630,Man United,"Good analysis from Carragher.

Will be interesting to see how Mainoo adapts to this role and whether Mount could get game time alongside Ugarte, given his stamina (when not injured) and pressing ability. Would be interesting to see Ugarte and Mainoo with Bruno and Mount in front of them. mount and ugarte could actually be a quality midfield for what Amorim wants to do. SO much work rate and Mount has shown time and time again that he is always going to do what hes told instruction wise (why so many managers like him) When Amorim' was telling the world how much he ""loves that kid"" he said he had 2 positions for Mount. Many thought it was either 10 but i think they're one and it's the 10s and the 8 Amorim has said he has two roles for Mount. I think Mount will mostly be the 10, but I can see him being next to Ugarte. Seems like he wants one ball winner and one box to box midfielder. I noticed Eriksen actually got a few opportunities to shoot, and I think Mainoo and Mount have that in their locker (the classic midfielder goal from the edge of the penalty box)."
7631,Man United,"This is good quality analysis because Carra clearly shows how minor issues with the tactical competence can make a big difference - as seen by Casemiro's position v Hutchinson in the build-up to the equaliser. Also good to see examples of the system working well because in the clip shown, we had them boxed in to the RB corner and forced a throw-in (or usually a pointless long hoof). 



It's so important to get Licha/Shaw back in the LCB role over Evans and Ugarte/Mainoo (weird he was an unused sub?) in for Casemiro. Mainoo is making his way back from injury so I understand if Amorim doesn’t want to rush him back in too soon. 

I also expected Ugarte to start but he flew back in from international duty in South America so I can understand if Amorim felt he was a bit jet lagged. 

Personally I don’t mind Amorim being more patient bringing back our key starters like those two because in the long term we don’t want to risk more injuries or fatigue like we suffered last season."
7632,Man United,Mirror mirror .. 
7633,Man United,"We will probably never see this starting XI again based on that analysis..... Unless we get another injury crisis I wouldn’t expect to see Casemiro, Eriksen, and Evans all starting together again in anything aside from perhaps a cup game against weaker opponents than Ipswich. The lack of mobility and intensity they have is a huge liability for Amorim’s system as this clip showed. 

This was Amorim’s first game while having players come back late from internationals along with some coming back from long term injuries so I can understand why he decided to try it out with that starting XI against Ipswich first."
7634,Man United,The good thing is I can actually see some tactics. Yes we got it wrong a few times but there was a plan. He gave us what he promised - an idea. And I’m happy with that.
7635,Man United,Not available in my country. Is there a different link? 
7636,Man United,"Now that the first game is done, players will know what is expected of them in those scenarios. Other situations will arise, but that'll allow for more corrections to be made. Such is the process. "
7637,Man United,"at some point sky will have to understand Man Utd and PL football in general is the most globalized thing in sport, so cut the regional lock ffs It’s coz they sell tv rights to local broadcasters and they have their own pundit shows in those countries. VPN is cheaper than their service and you get access to much more. It’s just Sky. They are a greedy bunch. It’s all about money"
7638,Man United,I hate it when Caragher does insightful interesting analysis. Really challenges my internal narrative about him. ngl he's probably my favourite pundit
7639,Man United,"Valid analysis from Carragher. Surprised Sky allowed him to show a positive clip and weren't pushing the negative. Carragher seems more excited about Amorim than most United fans at the moment lol, he seems genuinely curious to see how his system works in the Premier League."
7640,Man United,"""You learn more from defeats than you do from victories.""
-Sir Alex Ferguson We drew the game mate"
7641,Man United,"As per Carras vid, some minor adjustments can bring immediate impact.  

I think we need to play players that played 3-4-3 before. Hojlund, Mount and Ugarte to play as much as possible.  

Hojlund can make the runs that he did in his Atalanta days, Mount can instruct his AM partner and Ugarte can instruct his midfield partner and the defensive line. "
7642,Man United,"Some good points and it is obvious that some of the players were not comfortable with the system and pressing. I'm now more curious to see Thursday's line up and performance. Really looking forward to it. 

  
General consensus seems to be Ugarte needs to play and Rasmus over Rashford up top. I'm looking forward to Licha coming back in alongside De Ligt and Maz.

Some players are going to have to get used to less playing time. Others are on their way out anyway, so there can be no complaints. "
7643,Man United,Why does sky do this? Why do they make their stuff available in UK only? 
7644,Man United,"Rashford I don't think will work in this system. He has gotten pretty lax. Yes he got a goal off a poor touch, but he just does not seem hungry. I understand hes the main striker in this formation, but ffs if a Ipswich player has the ball and youre within 2 meters of him, RUSH HIM, GET IN HIS FACE, DONT GIVE THAT PLAYER TIME TO THINK OF A PASS, YOU MIGHT WIN THE BALL, THAT PLAYER MIGHT MAKE A MISTAKE

Ive seen it plenty of times, our attackers just casually jogging when an opposing player has control of the ball right next to them, and they dont even try to put pressure or press or do something to atleast defend"
7645,Man United,One of the (very) few analyses I've seen him give I agree with 
7646,Man United,"Great video 
Was just about to post it
Its clear amorim has a vision and system and he will implement at all costs
Once we get some injury returns we will play much better
2 CM’s in there last year if prem football with no legs ruins the whole press "
7647,Man United,Was there more than that? 
7648,Man United,"This is a level of football where it isn't enough to be good. You have to make the other team lose, you have to impose your game upon them, its an active thing. This is where I think the intensity and work rate comes into it. Casemiro and Evans not quite fulfilling their roles correctly in that early clip are an example of failing to IMPOSE upon Ipswich. They are learning the new system and realistically I think it will be Ugarte and Martinez in those positions very soon who are very aggressive, intense players who will not lack for imposing. "
7649,Man United,This was always the risk bringing in a manager mid season who has his own way of playing. Honestly im surprised Ruben agreed to come right now considering the season Sporting are having and how difficult it is to implement a new system well into the season with a new team. He's 100% the right hire and what this club needs right for the future but its gonna take a huge squad overhaul and time to get this right. 
7650,Man United,Wish we could get the high view from the goalkeeper end for the whole game! 
7651,Man United,"I feel like United is lucky as it has an identity - fast attacking football, wingers, mercurial geniuses, etc....

Bringing in a guy obsessed with one particular system mid season in this league is about as risky as it gets - we are barely above the relegation fight 

I was happy with Ruud ball to be honest, and I'd bring back Ole ball in a heart beat "
7652,Man United,"Languishing mid table, struggling to score goals - dangerous time to experiment with a new system, feel like this could go horribly wrong

Only have to drop a few places and it's a full blown crisis

Feel like Ruud ball was what we needed till end of season - the players looked rejuvenated under it and we were suddenly scoring again I think the point is that Ruud ball would end up like Ole ball. Eventually the goals dry up and the lack of underlying system or structure means the whole thing tumbles like a pack of cards."
7653,Man United,He got the formation wrong. It’s one DM and 2 in front / either side that covers the space wide that he’s talking ha bout. The flat two doesn’t cover it but that’s not how we played  Its not a flat 2. One acts like a 6 and the other like an 8. There was a couple of times when Case was deeper than Eriksen
7654,Man United,"Which is normal. They’re not confident they can do it, like Amorim said, they were overthinking. 

It’ll come with time Hopefully Do we have time - we're barely above the relegation fight in a the world's most competitive league"

I think Ole ball was ding OK until we signed Ronaldo, tried to play more expansively, and neglected the middle of the park - that Greenwood, Rashford, Martial front three was pure United and a joy to watch 

And Ole was a limited manager - I don't see why the traditional United style couldn't be successful in the right hands and that's our identity 

I think Amorim is a good manager - but trying to enforce a radical new style in the middle of a season where we are hovering above the relegation battle is extremely risky - a decent chunk of our players are not going to be suited to this way of play and it could really tun sour very quickly (what if we fall a few places in the league and its February all of a sudden?)

I think Ruud ball would have given us a positive Ole impact until the end of the season at least"
7675,Man United,"Its not a flat 2. One acts like a 6 and the other like an 8. There was a couple of times when Case was deeper than Eriksen Case was deeper because he was the DM. Eriksen and Bruno just in front of him. Bruno wasn’t a 10 but Jamie has his formation lined up that way in the graph. The manager even said he wanted Bruno on the ball more and spraying his long passes (but not too much) 

Maybe he just wanted to make the point about space between the lines but that wasn’t a factor in the game. I think he cheated his point a bit "
7676,Man United,Hopefully I trust him. I’m the negative one in this sub and I can already tell we have a proper manager.
7677,Man United,Do we have time - we're barely above the relegation fight in a the world's most competitive league What’s the alternative to giving him time? For the love of God You’re acting as if Ten Hag was guaranteed to get a better result with his game plan after 2 years..

7679,Man United,Somehow streamff never works for me. Have you tried another browser? Doesn’t work in FF for me but does work in Safari. I have the same problem.
7680,Man United,Bless you 
7681,Man United,"That United has been criminally negligent in recruiting proper CMs is one of the more baffling things of the past 10 years. More than 10 years, even under Fergie we fans were screaming for midfield signings every summer since Hargreaves' injury. rIt's more that the CMs signed have either been mediocre or not fit the system, or were too old when they signed. There have been so many wasted CM signings- Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin, Mata, Fellaini, Pogba, Mount, Amrabat, Eriksen (fantastic but too immobile), Casemiro  (1 great season but too old), Donny, Fred.  The only 2 who worked for more than a season were Herrera and Matic"
7682,Man United,"I still think Mount can work as a CM in this formation. Maybe in certain situations but I think Amorim will primarily use him as one of the 10s. Mount’s best ever spell under Chelsea also came as one of the wide attackers in Tuchel’s 343 so I think that role overlaps more with the 10 role in Amorim’s system. 

Most importantly we need to first see if Mount can stay fit for the rest of the season otherwise he can’t really be counted on anywhere. For the several games a year he’s fit. Maybe. He’s missed 51 matches with injury in 3 and a bit years. I’m not sure adding a really high intensity role helps him. Maybe though I don't rate mount at all in the slightest whatsoever, but he'd be potentially *brilliant* beside Ugarte in that 2 man cm. He's been injured and shit but he's still a proper intelligent hard working player, very good at carrying out manager instructions so yeah I can actually really see it."
7683,Man United,"Definitely need to replace casemiro and eriksen and get someone for that lwb position. Maybe a striker but guess we'll see how hojlund adapts as rashford isn't going to go cut it. Eriksen’s contract expires in the summer so I expect him to be gone. I think Casemiro has one more year on his contract after this season so I imagine he most likely stays because it would be hard to find a buyer on his huge wages. 

Financially it would feel foolish to spend big funds to sign yet another striker after a significant amount was spent to bring in Hojlund and Zirkzee in consecutive summers. Hopefully they can start stepping up in the next few months. If they still mostly struggle like they’ve done so far this season, then we might have to get a striker but financially I imagine we would have to find a buyer for either Rashford or even Hojlund first to afford it."
7684,Man United,"This might be wishful thinking, but our academy has some really really phenomenal midfielders right now, and I have a good feeling one of them can make the jump to the first and save us 50-100m. 

Kone, Fitzgerald and Fletcher are all so good at football it's crazy. Next season just might be a bit too early. That would require any one of those from the academy to step up and immediately make an impact as a starter like Mainoo did last season. Realistically these situations rarely turn out this well. 

Can’t say I follow our academy teams at all but if they can progress really well and impress Amorim, maybe they can get some cameo appearances in cup games or coming off the bench for a few minutes in league games if we are already comfortably winning towards the end of this season. That would already be a very good outcome for their development, and even then I would still believe we’d need to sign a starter in midfield for the summer. 

As it currently stands I am worried that our midfield becomes too reliant on Mainoo, and his development takes a step back as he gets tired or even worse pick up more injuries. He’s already had a long term injury in each season since he got fast tracked into the first team in last year’s summer preseason tour. I strongly believe Mainoo’s development will be more beneficial with a capable midfielder that can rotate with him. 

At the same time we only truly have one physical midfield destroyer that can capably protect the defense in Ugarte. Casemiro used to be good at that but he clearly doesn’t have the legs for it anymore.  

We really need a well rounded midfielder in the summer that both has the physical attributes to cope with the Premier League’s intensity and the tactical intelligence and technique to contribute in Amorim’s system."
7685,Man United,Shaw is perfect as an LCB in this formation tbh. Might be better for his injuries too 
7686,Man United,"Yeah, I think we need a CM that is good with running but can be a good playmaker. "
7687,Man United,"Personally I think this would be our best midfield. Has a good balance of technical ability and energy I agree - also allows the likes of Rashford/Garnacho to be dangerous supersubs v tired legs second half Not just technical ability and energy, it’s got the key criteria in all these modern systems of play: high footballing IQ. 

And high footballing IQ is what allows an aging Evans and Eriksen to look decent and some players much younger to just look so un-coachably pathetic. The main issue is the lack of long balls from the two central midfielders. But definitely I think it's a good mix. Mount and Bruno as the 10s is exciting, to me."
7688,Man United,"As long as Amad is playing right wing I think that's our best option tbh. Mason is a monster out of possession. And he knows the specific tactic and formation too. We desperately need someone that is good at pressing. The was a time last season where you could actually see his leadership in that regard, pointing to players where they need to be. If mount can stay fit, then him and Ugarte is a massive upgrade on the Casemiro and Eriksen midfield that played against Ipswich. It’s high footballing IQ, work rate, determination, stamina. Aka all the core components of what made Amorim’s entire Sporting team look mint. 

Once Martinez and Yoro are back, I can easily see Amad and Bruno in the dual 10s feeding Hojlund chance after chance after chance. I can see a fit Shaw at LWB and Mazraoui at RWB rounding things off. 

That’s more like the tenets of an Amorim team. Sadly I get how so much of the above is just a fantasy given the unreliable availability of some of them."
7689,Man United,Yes plz !!! We  forget mount won the CL in the same position 👌🏽👌🏽 
7690,Man United,"Ugarte brings energy, but that's about it - dunno if you can build a team around a guy who is so easy to press and with such poor passing "
7691,Man United,"Wait, how would the team look like then? 

Hojlund striker, 

garna/rashford LW, Amad RW, 

Mount LM, Bruno RM, 

Mainoo and ugarte as DMs, 

Marzoui/ Dalot RB, Deligt/ Licha/ Yoro CB, Licha/ shaw LB? Keep Amad at RWB, Mount and Bruno as the RW/LW, and drop Garnacho/Rashford completely Amorim’s system doesn’t have DMs. He has 2 CMs flanked by two wingbacks in what appears a 3-4-3 on paper but in reality is a bit more fluid to understand space and create pressing zones, overloads, and overlaps. 
It’s the insistence of the system to democratize most things and share the load that allows for a non-DM to play what appears to be a holding or defensive mid role. It’s why Ugarte or Mainoo or Eriksen or Bruno or Mount could all technically play in those two midfield positions without it looking like you’ve shoved an Eriksen into a traditional DM role. Casemiro can of course play one of those CM roles too even though he’s for the most of his career played a traditional DM role."
7692,Man United,"Yep, Mount slots in where Eriksen played. Where Eriksen lacked is running to create passing lanes or to receive the ball. For some reason so many of our players never run to receive a pass. It's infuriating. "
7693,Man United,"Amomrim clearly mentioned he never risks players for 1 match, compromising long term availability.. I hope he sticks to this, as the pressure for results being our manager can be too much. That’s great to hear because our last two full time managers in both Ten Hag and even Ole had a bad habit of being over reliant on several key starters and rushing them back too soon from major injuries, or making them play through injuries. 

I do hope the board and the fans can be patient with Amorim especially for the rest of this season as he continues to coach up the side while also balancing the need to rotate them. Isn’t he a stickler for recovery and that?"
7694,Man United,Yeah. He also stated that he played the ones that he'd managed to do some training with and that the 1 day of training wasn't enough to start for Ugarte and others that had been on international duty.

7700,Man United,"He's easily the best pundit, aside from being irritating as fuck when he's on commentary for Pool games, the guy speaks more sense than the rest of them. "
7701,Man United,This is one of the reasons I much prefer him to Neville. You just know Gary would have done a whole segment on Rashford's body language or some shit. 
7702,Man United,His analysis of that Ten Hag donut midfield was very convincing. Even I used to think maybe the donut midfield is some 999 IQ play that will soon show results but Carragher showed how insanely dumb it was. 
7703,Man United,It felt like a loss mate. No it didn't
7704,Man United,"I think Ole ball was ding OK until we signed Ronaldo, tried to play more expansively, and neglected the middle of the park - that Greenwood, Rashford, Martial front three was pure United and a joy to watch 

And Ole was a limited manager - I don't see why the traditional United style couldn't be successful in the right hands and that's our identity 

I think Amorim is a good manager - but trying to enforce a radical new style in the middle of a season where we are hovering above the relegation battle is extremely risky - a decent chunk of our players are not going to be suited to this way of play and it could really tun sour very quickly (what if we fall a few places in the league and its February all of a sudden?)

I think Ruud ball would have given us a positive Ole impact until the end of the season at least > where we are hovering above the relegation battle

We're also just as close to second place, but I suppose you like it to sound more dramatic to enforce your 'should have stuck with Ruud' argument. I disagree. “The traditional United style” is just attachment to a bygone era. Teams have to move on. We can’t stick to the system that made Ronaldo, Giggs, Rooney, Scholes because

- Ferguson is retired. He was maybe the greatest manager of all time. It’s possible he was the only manager capable of playing such attacking football without ending up in disaster. Who knows. 

- We don’t have the same litany of world class players anymore. The players under the Ferguson era were uniquely brilliant - the Class of 92 is freakish in the talent on offer. We don’t have that level of Academy graduates on that scale. So without the players, we need a system that can be coached. 

- Other teams have changed. Aside from them no longer fearing United, which used to give us a psychological edge in every fixture that has now gone, other teams have better-coached players, smarter managers, and more money than at any time in Ferguson’s era (in absolute and relative terms). We cannot rely on a straightforward caveman philosophy of “bang it down the line and cross it in - attack attack attack!” Against sophisticated opponents."
7705,Man United,"Case was deeper because he was the DM. Eriksen and Bruno just in front of him. Bruno wasn’t a 10 but Jamie has his formation lined up that way in the graph. The manager even said he wanted Bruno on the ball more and spraying his long passes (but not too much) 

Maybe he just wanted to make the point about space between the lines but that wasn’t a factor in the game. I think he cheated his point a bit  "
7706,Man United,I trust him. I’m the negative one in this sub and I can already tell we have a proper manager. I mean I'm sure Ruben is world class but I just don't trust our players
7707,Man United,"What’s the alternative to giving him time? I think the time to do this was July - not in the middle of a hectic season where we are midtable 

It would be totally understandable for it to take months for his system to click - but what happens now if we are dragged into the bunch of teams trying to avoid the relegation battle"
7708,Man United,For the love of God 
7709,Man United,"You’re acting as if Ten Hag was guaranteed to get a better result with his game plan after 2 years.. Ruud ball seemed ideal to me until summer and a proper pre season and window

Pulling this off mid season is a tough ask"
7710,Man United,Have you tried another browser? Doesn’t work in FF for me but does work in Safari. 
7711,Man United,I have the same problem. Same - anybody with alternate link?
7712,Man United,"More than 10 years, even under Fergie we fans were screaming for midfield signings every summer since Hargreaves' injury. In fairness there’s complaining while you have a Carrick and Scholes, and then there’s the criminal negligence of you have an Eriksen and a Casemiro and you think you’re fine because you also have the ‘we’ve got Valverde and Camavinga at home’ of Ugarte and Mount."
7713,Man United,"rIt's more that the CMs signed have either been mediocre or not fit the system, or were too old when they signed. There have been so many wasted CM signings- Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin, Mata, Fellaini, Pogba, Mount, Amrabat, Eriksen (fantastic but too immobile), Casemiro  (1 great season but too old), Donny, Fred.  The only 2 who worked for more than a season were Herrera and Matic "
7714,Man United,"Maybe in certain situations but I think Amorim will primarily use him as one of the 10s. Mount’s best ever spell under Chelsea also came as one of the wide attackers in Tuchel’s 343 so I think that role overlaps more with the 10 role in Amorim’s system. 

Most importantly we need to first see if Mount can stay fit for the rest of the season otherwise he can’t really be counted on anywhere. Bruno and Mount would be fantastic pairing with ugarte and maino in behind"
7715,Man United,For the several games a year he’s fit. Maybe. He’s missed 51 matches with injury in 3 and a bit years. I’m not sure adding a really high intensity role helps him. Maybe though 
7716,Man United,"I don't rate mount at all in the slightest whatsoever, but he'd be potentially *brilliant* beside Ugarte in that 2 man cm. He's been injured and shit but he's still a proper intelligent hard working player, very good at carrying out manager instructions so yeah I can actually really see it. A lot of mixed messages there guy..."
7717,Man United,"Eriksen’s contract expires in the summer so I expect him to be gone. I think Casemiro has one more year on his contract after this season so I imagine he most likely stays because it would be hard to find a buyer on his huge wages. 

Financially it would feel foolish to spend big funds to sign yet another striker after a significant amount was spent to bring in Hojlund and Zirkzee in consecutive summers. Hopefully they can start stepping up in the next few months. If they still mostly struggle like they’ve done so far this season, then we might have to get a striker but financially I imagine we would have to find a buyer for either Rashford or even Hojlund first to afford it. Hojlund shouldn’t be judged until the coaching fixes the simple fact that he’s being asked to put up elite numbers with little to no service. He’s a far better finisher than most of this squad. 
Let’s not forget that Amorim has made a former Coventry player (who nobody wanted) look legitimately world class. We have simply not seen Hojlund’s ceiling yet. He looks better than Harry Kane did when he was his age.

The problem we have is in CM, where I believe we need at least 2 more solid and dependable players with physicality, work rate and high footballing IQ. 

Systems like Amorim’s don’t need Pirlos and Zidanes. They need Fletchers and Herreras and recruited shrewdly shouldn’t cost a lot of money. Just look at what Leicester did in getting Kante or Brighton in getting Caicedo. I don't think it's foolish but it's going to be a low priority. Zirkzee isn't even a proper striker, I've got no idea what his best position is going to be. We don't score anywhere near enough goals so if there's a striker they identify then I'm sure it will be an option. 

Obviously there's other positions that will take priority though and perhaps once the new system is up and running then maybe certain players will surprise us and adapt well. What would be foolish is having players unable to score goals in the most important position on the field. A good goal scorer covers up the bad days. How many times has Salah or Haaland grab points for them when they probably shouldn't get them? If we can get Gyokeres we have to get him in the summer. we need to take the L on JZ probably.  He’s got some time to prove me wrong but he’s not young. And he’s not good so far.   If his wages aren’t insane we should dump him if he doesn’t prove something more this season."
7718,Man United,"That would require any one of those from the academy to step up and immediately make an impact as a starter like Mainoo did last season. Realistically these situations rarely turn out this well. 

Can’t say I follow our academy teams at all but if they can progress really well and impress Amorim, maybe they can get some cameo appearances in cup games or coming off the bench for a few minutes in league games if we are already comfortably winning towards the end of this season. That would already be a very good outcome for their development, and even then I would still believe we’d need to sign a starter in midfield for the summer. 

As it currently stands I am worried that our midfield becomes too reliant on Mainoo, and his development takes a step back as he gets tired or even worse pick up more injuries. He’s already had a long term injury in each season since he got fast tracked into the first team in last year’s summer preseason tour. I strongly believe Mainoo’s development will be more beneficial with a capable midfielder that can rotate with him. 

At the same time we only truly have one physical midfield destroyer that can capably protect the defense in Ugarte. Casemiro used to be good at that but he clearly doesn’t have the legs for it anymore.  

We really need a well rounded midfielder in the summer that both has the physical attributes to cope with the Premier League’s intensity and the tactical intelligence and technique to contribute in Amorim’s system. I 100% agree with you here, they're unfortunately just 1 year too young."
7719,Man United,I agree - also allows the likes of Rashford/Garnacho to be dangerous supersubs v tired legs second half Rashford a very expensive super sub but I don’t disagree
7720,Man United,"Not just technical ability and energy, it’s got the key criteria in all these modern systems of play: high footballing IQ. 

And high footballing IQ is what allows an aging Evans and Eriksen to look decent and some players much younger to just look so un-coachably pathetic. "
7721,Man United,"The main issue is the lack of long balls from the two central midfielders. But definitely I think it's a good mix. Mount and Bruno as the 10s is exciting, to me. "
7722,Man United,"We desperately need someone that is good at pressing. The was a time last season where you could actually see his leadership in that regard, pointing to players where they need to be. "
7723,Man United,"If mount can stay fit, then him and Ugarte is a massive upgrade on the Casemiro and Eriksen midfield that played against Ipswich. It’s high footballing IQ, work rate, determination, stamina. Aka all the core components of what made Amorim’s entire Sporting team look mint. 

Once Martinez and Yoro are back, I can easily see Amad and Bruno in the dual 10s feeding Hojlund chance after chance after chance. I can see a fit Shaw at LWB and Mazraoui at RWB rounding things off. 

That’s more like the tenets of an Amorim team. Sadly I get how so much of the above is just a fantasy given the unreliable availability of some of them. Amad would play in the RWB spot. There's nobody else who fits that position in Amorim's system. He likes using a left footed right winger as the RWB, to hold width and provide runs forward. The RWB also stays high in buildup. Amad would be perfect in this role."
7724,Man United,"Keep Amad at RWB, Mount and Bruno as the RW/LW, and drop Garnacho/Rashford completely Oh! I can't remember the last time we played without either of garnacho and rashford. For all their short comings, i feel like they have been the main threat for us going forward for the last couple of seasons. And wouldn't this put an awful lot on Amad? He has to be defensively astute while also being the main threat going forward. I'm no football expert and am not dismissing the idea, but i do have doubts on whether our players can pull it off"
7725,Man United,"Amorim’s system doesn’t have DMs. He has 2 CMs flanked by two wingbacks in what appears a 3-4-3 on paper but in reality is a bit more fluid to understand space and create pressing zones, overloads, and overlaps. 
It’s the insistence of the system to democratize most things and share the load that allows for a non-DM to play what appears to be a holding or defensive mid role. It’s why Ugarte or Mainoo or Eriksen or Bruno or Mount could all technically play in those two midfield positions without it looking like you’ve shoved an Eriksen into a traditional DM role. Casemiro can of course play one of those CM roles too even though he’s for the most of his career played a traditional DM role. "
7726,Man United,"I think this is a fair assessment. 
What baffles me is how come our fitness levels are so bad, since so much of the training under EtH focused on running. I don’t believe for a second it’s fitness, it’s intensity. The issue with the team is not effort its intensity. The team have spent the past couple of years aimlessly running around for long stretches and seemingly coached ‘not to panic’.

Too often yesterday De Ligt was taking ages on the ball, Rashford walking around etc. it’s not because they don’t have the capability to play with intensity or move the ball quickly, they’ve just forgotten how to.

The best example is the last 45 seconds of the game. Amorim is screaming at them to get the ball forward and we knock it around and don’t get it in their half before the full time whistle blows. I don’t think we will see a repeat of that.

The excellent news is he now has tape of the team playing which he can use with them this week. Even better by this time next week he will have two more tapes. 

The evolution is coming. The quality is there imo, they’ve just got to learn to play progressive, dominant football again rather than transition football Our fitness levels seem to have been an issue since lvg. I remember ole commenting on it when he took over. Laziness seems to have been rife for years. It’s not only just about running training but also intensity, tactical awareness, decision-making and the confidence of the players. All of which are severely lacking. So Amorim has a mountain to climb. lack of intensity has nothing to with fitness levels. it's just that Eriksen and casemiro were playing in the role of the pressing midfielders and they aren't just mobile enough to that. Not only that their positioing to receive the ball from our CBs weren't that good as you can see threy struggle to make progressive passes in the first half. that improved when uguarte came on. 

Since this is completely new system (not a 433 or a 442) most of our players would not have played in back 3 system, hence the issue of intensity. I think its only in Jan (at the earliest) we can realistically start looking and saying where the issues are in terms of players. The one thing is that the EPL is miles ahead of the Primeira Liga, and so Amorim cannot expect his tactics to just work, he must also make adjustments for this league. 

the last thing is that i will make a prediction, both Rashford and Garnacho will have no place in this team, if we keep this formation, and will be sold. Remember the players moaned about how much running they had to do under EtH, which came out in the media after he got sacked. 

Maybe there is an issue with a lot of our squad who don't actually want to work hard. Not really fitness but intensity especially during the press. Most of our players stop after the first action when sustained pressure would've meant we regain the ball Because we have a very slow team so they are having to expend more energy when defending. Other players fast jogs are almost full sprints for some of our players. ETH was a disasterclass in fitness management. With games coming thick and fast, and us losing the matches, he insisted on more running in training, rather than focusing on rest and recovery. 

To be very honest, under such stringent schedules that our players have, the only real option for physical condition baseline improvement is during preseason. During the season, you can only focus on rest and recovery in between matches. It's not fitness it's laziness. Maybe the answer is simply that we just don’t have a team of elite athletes. Bang average players playing for an elite club"
7727,Man United,"I actually don't mind that we haven't seen a win straight away. Too many times under new management the first couple games are a fairytale and we get carried away. At least now we can look forward to a new system, and watch this team grow into the system from the foundation phase and see if it works. > Too many times under new management the first couple games are a fairytale and we get carried away

Never forget the outright shock when we beat Swansea 4-1 in Moyes' first league game. That was so funny."
7728,Man United,"
Even though there were certainly some deep seated issues on display I still wouldn't extrapolate any long term conclusions on anything from this game.

It was a complete hodge-podge lineup owing to injuries and returnees and issues were compounded by the fact that it was a totally new system with a new manager that many of the players only had one or two training sessions with. And also, when you look at the second half in isolation, United were pretty good in a footballing sense. They retained more possession and had passages of quick one-touch football that were easy on the eye.

But you're right; the entire squad of players will need to get up to speed with Amorim's system, and that will take some time. Thankfully we're done with international breaks for a while. Honestly we need to focus on getting less injury-prone players. During most of Ten Hag's tenure we had critical players out - and after a certain point we can't keep using it as an excuse. If we ALWAYS have important players out, we need to change strategy

  
Also we need to learn how to play even WITHOUT critical players, something Ten Hag clearly couldn't do. Great managers learn how to make do with the current players they have, while Ten Hag would just keep complaining about it and wouldn't adapt"
7729,Man United,"Nice to see someone highlighting the center backs. Especially in the 2nd half they weren't nearly aggressive enough even during spells of consolidated possession. 

Inzhagis' Inter as an example will have at least 1 center back provide options off the ball by running into half spaces, the opponent box or occupy the midfield.

That central center back spot is going to be heavily contested. I can see Maguire or Martinez being 1 of 2 to settle in that role Yeah I know we see maguire occasionally get caught out but on the ball he is actually very good. Especially for England. I think a Maguire De Ligt and Martinez back three can work and then get Yoro in when he’s ready Also the likes of Scalvini in Atalanta. He just takes the ball from CB, moves on with it, or makes plays with the midfielders, etc. If United has the money, and if he is fit, I would be on him - or someone his style. 

But probably Amorim plays it safe and snatches one of our Sporting CBs :D There was so many times I was thinking - the CBs are just not quick enough. They were always a couple of yards off getting to the ball first etc."
7730,Man United,"Thanks for the writeup. Most of us fans agree and understand most of your points. Yesterday's selection was based mostly on the available players who had already trained in the new formation.

1. Usually, Licha is the one who progresses the ball and makes line-breaking passes. He is just so good at it and press-resistant.
2. No one would think Eriksen and Case would have a future here. Eriksen can play when I think we are leading and want to control games. Yesterday they were outrun and pressed to the point that we cannot have possession in the midfield. Most of the time we progress through the wings.
3. I'd argue that Mount could be a better fit as a 10 if he could stay fit. His pressing is also more disciplined. Calm on the ball is not one of Bruno's strengths. Bruno's pressing usually leaves a hole in the midfield. The two of them can rotate for the 10 position.
4. Yes. Rashford's proved times and times that he's not an out-and-out striker. He doesn't seem to have the energy to play wingback, which makes the only sensible position for him as a pacey 10. Rashford is done. There's very little evidence of him ever displaying the kind of intensity Amorim wants from his team. If he wasn't going to do it against Ipswich, in the new coach's first game, straight after an international break where he didn't play a game, then there isn't a chance of him doing it consistently throughout the season.

If Amorim indulges him the way Ten Hag did, he's gone in 2 years. Rashford's just fucking done mate. New manager, opportunity in his ""best position"", expecting him to show what he can do and instead he trudged around shoulders down jogging about not even trying. If he hadn't been there to tap in after Amad's amazing work it would have been among his worst performances in a long time. To me it looked like Mount was the only one who ran like ""he was supposed to"" after he came one. You could see him set up on-two's, running into space, etc. and everyone else ignored him."
7731,Man United,"I appreciate the insights from Sporting fans especially around tactics, but that starting XI yesterday was borderline makeshift due to international break and fitness levels. 

Martinez, Shaw, Yoro, Mainoo and Ugarte I assume will be starters in Amorim’s preferred XI if fit and ready. 

I also assume Dalot would be shifted to his preferred RWB side, with Diallo possibly moving to one of the 10s. 

That’s not even mentioning Mount, who Amorim has apparently taken a shining to. 

All in all yesterday was fine as an opening game. He’s got two nice games at OT coming up where we can hopefully show a bit more and give us another 180 mins to get to grips with the tactic and pick up two wins to give us some confidence. >I also assume Dalot would be shifted to his preferred RWB side, with Diallo possibly moving to one of the 10s.

I feel he will have to stick to the left because let's be honest Mazz has that position in an iron grip unless he's unfit. And arguably he's much more effective and efficient in that position.

If Dalot wants his place he will have to fight for it, just like it should be.

I really really want Garnacho to do the same, I don't want him going down the Rashford lane.

The laid back & they've got no choice attitude is what's setting the rot."
7732,Man United,"I am going to amaze myself by agreeing with Jamie Redknap. It is almost pointless analysing this performance as lots of the players will not start when Amorim has everyone available and had everyone for more training sessions. 

A big issue was midfield and I doubt we will see an Erickson/Casemiro midfield duo again. 

CB was also an issue but Martinez and Yoro will massively improve that area

Rashford isn't a 9 but Hojlund is a lot better option in that position

Mazroui will be better at WB than CB and Shaw/Malacia on the left will be better than Dalot

Also hopefully some of these players will learn and grow into the system. Garnacho is still young enough to be moulded into a WB or a 10 that will suit the style of play. If anyone can get him to play more for the team than himself it is Amorim. 

A big issue, as Amorim said after the game, is that when you are learning a new system you have to think a lot rather than play on instinct and that slows things down. After a bit more training and coaching these things will come more naturally and things will speed up a bit

Some are saying the players are too lazy or don't run enough but I think that is only true of a couple of players. Of course all it takes is a couple of players to stop the system working but if they can either be shaken up to get their shit together or dropped then I think that will improve things.

I think all in all considering the new formation and lack of training sessions it could have been worse. I agree. Another Sporting fan made a post about how the first 5 games are kinda like try outs or auditions. He's looking at who will fit his system or not. This proces will take some patience.

Also like you said, this line up was mostly based upon who was fit to play. I felt we were able to get more control in the game with Ugarte and Shaw in the second half.

At least he's seen now that an Eriksen Casemiro midfield won't work. Next game we'll a Mainoo Ugarte midfield. And he also knows that playing Rashford as a striker is not a viable option.

I do wonder if our playing out from the back is so lethargic due to the cb's not being progressive or adventurous enough with their passing or that the midfielders weren't making themselves available enough. Because that could improve with Mainoo on the pitch and Amad playing as one of the 10's. They're both very comfortable receiving the ball on the half turn or with their back towards the goal. > but Hojlund is a lot better option in that position


Hojlund's movement is a problem. He plays like he doesn't want to score. 


Rashford yesterday, who isn't a striker, gambles for Amad's cross and scores. 


Garnacho in a similar position on the other side and Hojlund is back at the penalty spot when he should be charging in. If he had done he'd have had a tap in from a good cross and we'd have won the game. 


Despite spending over 100 million on two strikers we still don't even have one that's actually a goal scorer "
7733,Man United,"Your points are good. Anyone who was expecting us to thrash Ipswich yesterday was deluded. We had less than a week to prepare and it’s the third manager these players have had this season. It’s going to take time for anything significant to change. I have no doubt he will quickly figure out who he can trust and who needs to be replaced. The style of play was clear, just poorly applied yesterday. "
7734,Man United,"Bro is a sporting fan writing hojlund and his force of habit mixed it with hjulmand Not gonna lie, I'm madly in love with Hjulmand, that might be it."
7735,Man United,"Thanks! Sounds like you know what you are talking, tactics wise.

But the point on intensity is true for any formation. Our players have been lazy and pedestrian for so long that it’s ingrained into the club’s culture. No manager can succeed here without changing this culture Yes, but some formations allow for more ""laziness"". 3-4-3 is very dynamic, as your LWB/RWB have to run up and down, help CBs, help midfielders, cross inside the pitch, etc, while your midfielders have to contend the game, but right after be able to take the ball up the pitch and appear on the area to score if needed. IMO, it's.a system made to have the ball majority of time - that's why you have to pressure at max to make opposition lose the ball, and play high in the pitch. You need to suffocate the other team.  It's a system that not only needs super intensity, but also a lot of teammate-helping-teammate."
7736,Man United,This is actually what I see most of our fans are saying too 
7737,Man United,"imo we lack players with technical ability and physical fitness its either or, or none at all. also hope we exercise the buy back for alvaro fernadez…. Lack of technical ability is a HUGE issue. ETH didn't like criticising players in public but he hinted many times and even said directly few times that we are not good enough with the ball.


If the manager of one of the most recent best position based teams can't get these players to improve in possession then it's clear the squad needs massive improvement. Sadly we yet again backed limited players over the manager, I hope we don't make that mistake again. Yeah very few of our players are capable of retaining possession for a sustained period. We even struggled against Ipswich to keep the ball. I think people also underestimate the importance of football IQ which is one the worst traits of this squad. The decision making from so many players is just poor which compounds the lack of technical ability. Rashford and Garnacho are prime suspects here. Even Bruno tends to get frustrated and force low percentage passes."
7738,Man United,"Thanks for the assessment.

In terms of Point 3, I believe Mason Mount is perfect for that role but he's had a lot of injury challenges. I hope he starts the next game.

Luke Shaw would be absolutely immense in the LWB role IF he could stay fit. We also have Malacia to try there. I'd like to see him start because Dalot is not the right fit. Dalot should in no way be starting for this team..be it at LB or RB or LWB or RWB.. his weight of passing is just awful"
7739,Man United,it's funny how people talk about how garnacho might go to real madrid . The harsh truth is he ain't anywhere near real madrid level talent . The fact that he consistently gets into our team as a starter shows how shit this united squad is . Just having Ronaldo as your idol and copying his celebration doesn't make you Ronaldo 
7740,Man United,"Personally I thought Diallo was the best player on the pitch. His control, composure, work rate and decision making were levels above everyone else on the utd team. Second best was onana. "
7741,Man United,"We started on the back foot with that XI. A lot of players are coming back from injury or international break. I hope Amorim was forced to play the 11 and that wasn't his preferred 11. 

Martinez and/or Yoro need to replace Evans. Ugarte and Mainoo/Mount as a midfield. And Amad should play behind Hojlund to be more involved in attack. He retains the ball better and is more penetrative. 

We cannot build our style with the players that started on Sunday. Rashford, Casemiro, Eriksen, Evans should be used off the bench. Dalot is lucky we lack fit fullbacks. "
7742,Man United,"It's truly amazing how poor a state the squad is in after all the money spent. I also agree with all your assessments. I'm not a big football brain myself, but if I can see it, how can so many in and around the club not? Or if they can, how can they fail to address it so often? "
7743,Man United,"It is a long way to go. The guy has barely started at the club. He's had 2 training sessions whilst a lot of players were out on Internationals. 

This season for me is a write off. I am not expecting any top 4 finishes. I just hope to see his style of play eventually manifest itself with the players. 

At the same time, I hope we see improved effort levels and dedication from the players. Too many are happy to go missing during matches. 

The good side is I know Amorim along with INEOS will be taking notes of which players are not being professional and disciplined in following the manager's instructions, and this will likely spell the end of their careers at the club. 

I am sure the club will back Amorim more this time as it is their pick and their guy. Player's want to throw tantrums and not be bothered to show dedication? Sold in the summer window and Amorim brings the player's he wants in. 

Very long way to go but me and I am guessing all the United fan base will be fully behind the manager. > This season for me is a write off


Exactly this. Ten Hag has already done the damage.


Hopefully Amorim now gets a good period without over the top pressure to bed in his system and we can actually look at bringing in/selling players as necessary in the summer with a clear picture. 


Big positive is that even with so little time he still went with the way he wants the team to play when it would've been easy to use a 4-3-3 and play the lack of training excuse card"
7744,Man United,"Better don’t tell this sub that Bruno is the best because they seem to think he is a problem. They won’t realize as you’ve pointed out, he is levels above others. 

The work rate issue is back just like when ETH took over. The players thought ETH was a slave driver cus he wanted them to run and thought Amorim is going to take it easy on them. Won’t be surprised when these players turn on him even quicker than ETH when things don’t work out. I didn’t see anything yesterday that made me think Bruno is levels above the rest. And I don’t think a Sporting fan is necessarily unbiased in that assessment. 

Bruno didn’t look comfortable in that role. Look at the front 3 Amorim utilized at Sporting and, for the most part, those are players who are good receiving and playing out of pressure. 

Long term it should be Amad playing there once we have more wingback options. I feel if mount can stay fit him and amad might just push bruno from the 11.. his inability to keep the ball and always playing glory ball is an issue"
7745,Man United,"People keep saying it's the players.


Hasn't Ten Hag brought in like 16 of these guys and spent 620 million?


We have had an open heart surgery - just by a bad surgeon. Martinez, De ligt, Mazaroui, Hojlund, Yoro, Onana will all start for Amorim once fit. Mount is proving to be an injury concern, Zirkzee hasn't hit the ground running. Eriksen and Evans were brought in for free. Antony is the one useless purchase and along with Casemiro, was bought for too much under the Glazers. 

The purchases in general are not bad. But the starting 11 was thrown together because of a lack of fitness from injury/international break. Ive debated in my comment history so many times in this sub who claimed we 'won the transfer window' this season 

and that the the football operations people were geniuses who already bought Amorim players just plug n play"
7746,Man United,"A big part of this is not just running, but knowing when and how to run. Rangnick spoke about it as well.

I think it is too early to be making pronouncements about who is lazy and who is not.

Lack of athleticism will surely get some of these players out of the team but that will come in time and with more evidence they cannot do it. "
7747,Man United,"If intensity is what Amorim is after, he's certainly got the wrong set of players (as they currently are). His main task would be a behavioural/mental one, because I can't see INEOS shifting 75% of the squad every 3 years for every new manager.

These are the players, this is the task. I'd love to see Amorim bench perennial starters who don't buy in. We've had enough of the big names. It's time for big performers. "
7748,Man United,Exactly the same argument when ETH came in and we all know how that went. 
7749,Man United,"Honest question from a United supporter- are we gong to get these posts for every single thing that now on? It's clearly popular with United fans - at least for now. Just look at the engagemnet here. Yeah, it's getting old very fast."
7750,Man United,"So de ligt doesn't have the ability to progress the ball or make line-breaking passes? He's worse than Sporting's main and all back-up CBs? 


I understand that you know Amorim's style better than most of us here, but you're grossly underestimating someone who was Bayern's and Juve's best CB "
7751,Man United,"Thankyou for this post. I made the same point that players will need to adapt or will be replaced in another post and got downvoted, specially someone calling me to rent a brain. I just dont see many of the current midfield and attacking players staying come next season. "
7752,Man United,"1. As others have mentioned MdL is the only one who will start at CB going forward. Martinez is fantastic at playing through the lines, Luke Shaw could possibly be an option there too, particularly after this season.

2. I think it was because they were the only CMs not away or coming off an injury, Ugarte would be a mainstay in this team, probably supported by either Mainoo or Bruno next to him.

3. I know I'm going against the grain and most would disagree, but I think Bruno would suit the 8 role, at least for the rest of the season, his passing and intensity would suit the team well because he never stops chasing the ball and is capable of switching the play better than anyone in the squad bar Eriksen. That means the two 10 spots should be Diallo, plus Mount, Garnacho or even Zirkzee.

4. Rashford is finished, Hoijlund and Zirkzee will be good rotation for that spot up front provided they can stay healthy and both offer different things.

I have faith in WB Antony, he works hard and actually has a decent cross in him, hopefully Amorim can get him out of his head and contributing to the team. Bruno is too light weight for the 8 role.. he lacks discipline.. he doesn't know when to push forward or drop back and his ball carrying isn't great.. MDL might not work in this system.. he dawdles on the ball too much, his ball playing is suspect, won't be shocked to see maguire move him out of the team"
7753,Man United,"It was one game after two proper training sessions, people need to relax. "
7754,Man United,"From your assessment, our entire team of yesterday performed below par, I think Bruno, Maz, Ahmad and Onana are the only players guaranteed of starting, the rest need to work harder. "
7755,Man United,"I don't believe that as things stand, anyone that started the 4 midfield slots yesterday is capable of playing in the positions they played in yesterday.

We need players comfortable receiving the ball and playing between the lines. Happy to play short intricate passing. That isn't any of the guys we had on yesterday. And until we have that, we will never be able to dominate the ball in the right areas. Our possession is so sterile. Bruno's brilliant at hero ball and genius chance creation, but outside that he doesn't offer anything. And that isn't a system. "
7756,Man United,Great analysis. Ruben will have to be brutal with ensuring that we have the right players in the squad. It’s likely that some players like Rashford will have to go 
7757,Man United,The players are overpaid and lazy as hell. 
7758,Man United,I’m just hoping that the board back him when it comes to getting rid of players. This club has been infected by overpaid players who don’t fight for the shirt ever since Sir Alex retired. I don’t care if they’re home grown or not. If you don’t want to fight for every blade of grass when you’re on the pitch then you don’t deserve to be at this club. It could take some time but I like what I’ve seen from Amorim so far. He has charisma but he also has that steel in his eyes. He has that intensity. He has the desire to win and he’s not intimidated by the scale of the job. Back him and give him time. The club needs to be burned down and rebuilt. Enough of trying to shortcut things. 
7759,Man United,I doubt OP is a Sporting fan .. maybe a United Fan masquerading as a sporting to make his post look objective … there is so much details in your post to pass for a Sporting Lisbon fan … 
7760,Man United,"What really worried me about the Amorim appointment is just how many players we need to buy with totally different skill sets to the current lot to make his system work. I'm all for giving him time but it just feels like we've signed ourselves up for an enormous, time consuming and expensive rebuild, which could be worth it if we see it through, but I have serious doubts whether we can [deleted] I don't think this is nearly as big an issue as people are making it.

That eleven yesterday had six players in it who shouldn't be starters in Amorim's system:

Evans

Dalot

Casemiro

Eriksen

Rashford

Garnacho

But most of them only started due to injuries or lack of training. Options to come into the team include:

Martinez

Maguire

Yoro

Ugarte

Mainoo

Shaw

Mount 

Malacia 

Those players can definitely change our intensity levels and our ability to retain the ball. But the question of centre forward is harder to answer, because all our options there seem less than ideal.

We have a squad that Amorim can work with, we have academy players who have potential. But we still have a lot of dead wood in the squad, as ever. Building to title contenders will take time and money, but that was always going to be the case. The needs and problems were there before manager change. 

Casemiro and Eriksen were replace list and that will happen soon. I believe Garnacho game time will be reduced. He dont have enough ball security to play as 10 or wingback. He has to evolve his game. 
Rasford, different manager, same problems, off ball intensity and work rate, aggressiviness. 

Otherhand. For my eye, even this short period höjlund and zirkzee were better in game and participation to system than anytime this season before. And both of them are piss poor form. 

There are plenty of room improve and some players may fit better Amorim system than they did Ten Hag’s. 

Thursday’s Bodo game will be interesting to see. How Amorim will manage lineup. 
I would love to see Ugarte Mainoo In midfield"
7761,Man United,"The never ending cycle of Manchester United. 

New manager comes in. Players are not good or fit enough for his system, we need alot of new players and patience. Two years go by, manager has gotten half the players he needs, results are lacking, we fire manager.

New manager comes in. Ten Hag got 15 permanent signings (before we get into loans)"
7762,Man United,"That's why I just question the appointment- if the manager has a tight budget because we spent huge sums on players who fit into a 4-2-3-1, is it reasonable to expect success from him with his system? I'm willing to be convinced but yesterday brought a lot of the misgivings I already had back to the surface, "
7763,Man United,"People sleep on maguire too much and think he deserves a chance to play under his system, yes he had that meme period but he came out of that pressure and started performing again, he might be slow but he can drive forward with the ball and break through the midfield, he can pass long balls, he’s dominant in the air and physical with his tackles, he just lacks pace and isn’t confident under pressure which seems to be improving after his meme stint "
7764,Man United,Ok Jose 
7765,Man United,"Half this post could be said about Ten Hag's time at United, coming from an Ajax supporter who saw what he's capable of. 


Something about the structure at United makes all the players intensely lazy and i don't know if anything can fix it at this point. Hope Amorim manages to unfuck things, but he's gonna have to Sisyphus his way up this mountain "
7766,Man United,"I'm sorry my friend, we have no spots left for sporting fans, there's someone here already. Talk again in January /s I don't recommend any of Sporting players :D"
7767,Man United,"It's the players now. There is nowhere to hide. Amorim's system works, he's proven he can do it and also take a washed side back to former glories with dominant, attractive football. If he fails here it's not the set up, it's not the Glazers, it's not anything but the players. Until he gets his own players in who can play the way he wants he should be given 100% leeway. If he loses 6 in a row his job should be secure. This chopping and changing isn't working and i 100% believe he's the man to do it but needs to be given at least 2/3 seasons.

I have two cousins who were brought up in a broken home. One is a successful building contractor with his own business, the other is a heroin addict. No matter how much help they got off family or the authorities the only thing she has in her is to be an excuse making tearaway who blames everyone else and takes zero responsibility. NOBODY can change these people, they have to change themselves and if they don't that's not the fault of those trying to help.

Sir Alex had this with Ravel Morrison. Unless Ravel decided to change his mentality and outlook, nothing would change him into the player he could have been.

United have this currently with the likes of Rashford and several others. If someone is lazy and doesn't want to run, and can't be convinced, then it's not on the manager. If they're just not good enough to implement the plan then that's also not on the manager.

Players are to blame now. "
7768,Man United,The best we can do is hoof the ball and expect it will not come back. 
7769,Man United,Decision making is largely terrible and that didn’t change yesterday. It’s like they don’t understand how to play football. 
7770,Man United,"Great insight, pretty much what I feel about the team "
7771,Man United,"Another thing is - if Ruben is so good as all of us believe he is, then players will have to go. Who is going to buy these players who can't work for the best coach? "
7772,Man United,"Similar sentiment, lots of times during the match where the CB has the space to do line breaking pass but end up passing the ball back to Onana. Need a central ball carrier, Mainoo should be able to do it in my opinion. "
7773,Man United,Well I am still not on the Amorim train as I have already burnt my fingers with Solskjaer.. But this is a good assessment and the fitness levels of some of the players are really worse. I am watching to see how we perform under Amorim or is it going to another divorce in 2-3 years 🤷‍♂️ 
7774,Man United,"I want to see Maz as a RM tbh, he's my favourite player atm. But dialo was great there too so we have multiple options. "
7775,Man United,"This is pretty similar to what rangnick said. They aren't physical enough, which in his words meant they don't play with intensity. "
7776,Man United,"100% no sentiment here. We should get rid of player like rash and garnacho who 100% not fit the system. 

For 2 number 10 I think mount, Bruno, diallo is good choice.
For st position don't see zirkee can fit since striker need to running into channel. 

For 2 midfield if we need intensity, eriksen and case should not be here. 

For cb I think we need someone with more agression. We have 3 young cb and 3 old cb. All of those old one need to go unfortunately. "
7777,Man United,Thank you so much for this post 
7778,Man United,"Very well said, it's the first step on a long road. It's going to be fascinating to see it happen and I've learned patience over the last decade or so so relax and enjoy it I say. "
7779,Man United,"This just confirms what we have known for years, several of these players are lazy or simply not able to fit a dynamic hungry system like Amorim’s or even the ETH one.

Rashford is the first one to come to mind. Garnacho, being the best we had isn’t ready for starting. He has always work best as an impact sub. Eriksen is just too slow nowadays. Zirkzee is a completely null.

Even when Ugarte and the rest if the subs came in we were as toothless as always. "
7780,Man United,"Casemiro and Eriksen are cooked. They've had their moments but if we're to build for the future, they just don't cut it anymore. ZERO energy in the midfield when they play and we got dominated as a result. A stark contrast when we moved Bruno to pair up with Ugarte. "
7781,Man United,"All the comments and criticisms have merit , however they should still be able to win a match against a team that's going to be relegated. "
7782,Man United,"Let’s see in 2 years. Manager might be  great but it’s the same old story. Time. Patience. More squad building. And hoping the new guy gets it right. The worry is again we will buying specific players for this manager. How inline is this with the long term vision of the club? The answer is we don’t know.  

The real test of Amorim is in 18 months. When the first set of player form loss, critical injuries and fixture list pile up all are bound to happen at the same time. He needs credit in the bank to survive and thrive through that period when the media will tear into him and his players.   "
7783,Man United,"Anybody else Amorim should get Bruno to operate less all over the pitch but, whatever position he is played in, he plays in that zone, is more findable, we can play with more of a pattern? "
7784,Man United,"Said it before, Rashford should have been sold after his 30 goal purple patch. PsG would have paid a lot for him Hindsight yo. This sub will see a season long violent outburst if that were to happen"
7785,Man United,"The comment about Hojlund is key, he needs the team behind him to function and feed him. He has the intensity and the finishing... He needs a team that can feed him facing goal rather than back to goal.  "
7786,Man United,"Just rewatched the game. I counted 8 Marcus Rashford sprints/runs into the channel that I felt could have been played to him. This team's inability to FIND the central strikers is mind-boggling. Doesn't matter if it's Rashy, Hojlund, CR7, Martial. Nobody even considers playing in the striker. That will change quickly, Sporting was obsessed with finding Gyokeres and he kept making creative runs, not just straight through the middle, but also in half-spaces"
7787,Man United,"Thank you for the assessment. I agree whole heartily.

Hopefully the injuries and tired players subside. Martinez is out for 2-3 weeks unfortunately. "
7788,Man United,"I think Mainoo (kind of unfortunately) fits the number 10 role in this system best. He’s super calm on the ball, receives with class touches in pockets of space and can turn, lay off and then move into a position to receive back. He’s not a defense-minded player that presses relentlessly though. I say kind of unfortunate because that’s where a lot of our forwards are going to want to play, so lots of competition. Amad did well at RWB, so I could see Mainoo/Bruno as the 10s with Amad staying out wide even if that might not be his absolute best position. 

There are going to be lots of changes in the team though as players come back from international break and injuries. The LWB/LCB slot especially with Shaw/Martinez/Malacia all coming back soonish. "
7789,Man United,"I can't believe we won the FA Cup with Garnacho and Rashford on the same team. Those 2 guys just don't seem to work, we look miles better with either one and Diallo on the opposite side... and Rasmus upfront. "
7790,Man United,"i think its a case of we just didn't have enough players back in training before this game.

several of what would be starters only had 1 day training or even no training after coming back from international games. Ugarte had an afternoon on friday...

also several players just come back from injuries so again to this game was Amorim just trying to make the most of what he could with the players available.

i do agree that Mazroui though showcased again that he has been an incredible buy. i also think De Ligt once a good back 3 is established will also work great.

Amad i felt did an ok job for somebody in a very new position but i do think i would have prefered him next to Bruno behind the striker but he has showcased hes got the intensity to play in this style of football. 

Eriksen and Casemiro i feel can be fine with 1 of them next to say Ugarte or Mainoo but both together it was clear they didnt have the legs to cover enough ground as a pair.

  
i saw an idea and knew this game was just way too early to see anything really crazy from him. "
7791,Man United,"Oh, an honest opinion. Well then, I guess I should care. "
7792,Man United,"That's a good post. United were so ordinary weren't they. Very disappointing. He has lots of work to do, Amorim. Many of the players are not up to the required standard for him. "
7793,Man United,"I think we'll need to bring Antony back into the fold for the RWB spot for this reason. The guy for all his faults brings intensity and there is a player in there somewhere. That would allow Amad to take the second 10 position. 

As i see it the players with the ability to play intensive - e.g pressing and work hard off the ball are as follows:

Yoro

Martinez

Shaw

Maz

Antony

Amad

Bruno

Ugarte

Mainoo

De ligt

Hoijlund "
7794,Man United,"Why do we need so many opinions and analysis of a manager’s after 2 training sessions and 1 game?

I’m gonna sound like a cunt but these “x fan coming in peace with my thoughts on y” seem nothing more than vying for imaginary internet points and validation.

There are thousands of videos and hundreds of posts, we don’t need more of these. Ruben himself seems to be already fed up off how much unnecessary media talk he’s having to give. I mean.. what else are we gonna talk about on an Internet forum dedicated to man utd stuff You expect us here, in a United forum, to talk about what? Weather?

OP brought a lot of good points from the game yesterday..."
7795,Man United,"Was with you until you said Bruno is far our best player - dude stinks out the place with his attitude and moaning - his positional play and awareness is zero - just runs around like a heedless individual - long balls constantly he will be phased under Amorim - Amorim constantly brings him up when he says he has the inability to keep the ball and goes long Spot on, diallo and mainoo are the ones who are levels above the rest"
7796,Man United,"Apart from the bruno evaluation this makes sense. I think Bruno is going to struggle in a disciplined side considering he has essentially been allowed to do whatever the hell he wants for the last 5 years with nearly 0 consequences. 

It's hard to see him surviving another year at United if he doesn't play to Amorim's preference. we should be serious about replacing him if that's the case (although I don't see it in Mount, the player who was essentially bought to replace him in the first place) Not really. He plays like that for us because he's the only player capable of consistently creating chances. He plays a more reserved style for Portugal and he's their best player most games"
7797,Man United,"He’s had 2-3 training sessions with the team mate, how about you take your player hatred back to sporting. 

You may understand how he played at sporting and even though he intends to use the same overall system, it’s not going to be like for like. 

He needs training time & games to figure out the strengths and weaknesses of his players and to get his message across. 

Your assessment is literally just trashing our players. Bore off back to your own sub or twitter with that shit. We support our team here "
7798,Man United,"Can we stop with all these ""I'm Ajax/Sporting/whatever fan so my opinion matters"" posts 🤡 "
7799,Man United,"Our 10 on the left is Mount. We just have to get him fit and able to stay fit. He did pretty much the exact same thing for Tuchel. He can press, he can maintain possession, make runs to either create space or find it for a shot at goal. I feel like the other one is Mainoo, and Bruno becomes deeper. 

But yeah, I agree with this assessment. I think Amorim is.the end of the road for some United players. Really feels like Rashford isn't the right guy. Difficult situation. Amorim and Dan are going to have to have that conversation soon. Eriksen and Evans done for sure. Casemiro is an odd one, but it might be a bad fit. 

Overall, it definitely seems to not be a fairytale turnaround but the start of a long journey. But I like that the issues seem so obvious. The path forward is clear. "
7800,Man United,Thank you for your honest and insightful comments. I tend to agree. The intensity issue is worrying. About time they linked fitness to pay/bonuses to coerce them into better performances 
7801,Man United,Seems like we need a whole new batch of players again. 
7802,Man United,Basically everyone is shit haha 
7803,Man United,Thanks for the analysis but we all know that already. Problem is that to solve it we need to replace half the squad. It's gonna take a while 
7804,Man United,"Its funny how the entire club is not good enough for Amorim. When I said he is a bad choice for us got downvoted and now you lot say the same thing. If we'd have another 600m to spend on new players, I'd understand Calm down Even Pep wouldn't get a tune out of these players. At least half our squad are midtable quality at best."
7805,Man United,"Don’t worry, it was the same shit with Ten Hag. People love to put blame on the managers but it is players who are not fit and technical skill for anything. "
7806,Man United,"I don’t believe for a second it’s fitness, it’s intensity. The issue with the team is not effort its intensity. The team have spent the past couple of years aimlessly running around for long stretches and seemingly coached ‘not to panic’.

Too often yesterday De Ligt was taking ages on the ball, Rashford walking around etc. it’s not because they don’t have the capability to play with intensity or move the ball quickly, they’ve just forgotten how to.

The best example is the last 45 seconds of the game. Amorim is screaming at them to get the ball forward and we knock it around and don’t get it in their half before the full time whistle blows. I don’t think we will see a repeat of that.

The excellent news is he now has tape of the team playing which he can use with them this week. Even better by this time next week he will have two more tapes. 

The evolution is coming. The quality is there imo, they’ve just got to learn to play progressive, dominant football again rather than transition football I think this is a very good distinction between fitness and intensity.  It will take time to reach the levels of intensity that Sporting, for example, had when they played city a few weeks ago, but I think we will start seeing improvements from game to game. Agreed. I also think it's quite interesting some of the things he's said publicly in this regard.

First of all he's came out and specifically praised Mason Mount. I think this is his way of signalling that his intensity is what RA ideally wants. Whatever else we think of Mount as a signing, the intensity of his play has never been in question. I think other managers have done the same thing by praising him so publicly - setting his workrate as the gold standard.

Secondly he's made public comments about running back and working for the team. If Mount's intensity is the goal, then the comments about tracking back are the baseline expectation. I think RA is basically setting the parameters of his expectations, and doing so publicly. What I really hope he'll do now in reaction to the Ipswich game is to assess who deserves to play next based on this criteria, regardless of their name/reputation and set the culture of the team this way. I think the right word is urgency. To ""activate"" your intensity/to run, you need to feel the urgency to press, urgency to attack, etc. They don't feel the urgency to. Hojlund did the exact same as Rashford after coming on, so clearly they have been instructed to do so for the time being. Maybe it’s a lack of fitness or maybe Amorim doesn’t trust they’ll get the press correct straight away. They are just lazy and overpaid.. While I agree and I hope he will succeed, there were tons of post game interviews with EtH were he said something along the lines of „we lacked intensity“.
No coahc till now could male these f*ckers work long term. Lets hope Amorim will. Beyond intensity it’s also integrity. Doing the hard work independently while no one else is watching. Our first goal caused more than half our players to just doze off and half ass their duties. I could see by minute 20-25 Rashy, Case, and Eriksen all pretty much check out and Ale, Evans, and Dalot around 35-40 minutes. I wouldn’t have been surprised to see subs at half but that would have been too jarring. I’d expect whoever starts on Thursday to get ready to put in one of the hardest shifts of their career because Ruben is already figuring out who isn’t going to cut it and after winter I wouldn’t be surprised to see some of these guys frozen out of the starting 11."
7807,Man United,"Our fitness levels seem to have been an issue since lvg. I remember ole commenting on it when he took over. Laziness seems to have been rife for years. We have had a long culture of recruiting players who come for the pay check and not because of their hunger. We miss out on CL and can't attract talent so we pay giant wages to convince players to come anyway. And these players are paid like they're the best in the league in their position. And they know we can't offload them since no one else is paying those wages so why should you give 130% when you can get away with much less? Rui Faria also had that effect during the Mourinho days. Him leaving had a devastating effect on Mou and the team. Our best year was under Ole, where we had our lowest possession average and just played on the counter. 

Building a team around Rashford and Bruno, we are doomed to fail"
7808,Man United,"It’s not only just about running training but also intensity, tactical awareness, decision-making and the confidence of the players. All of which are severely lacking. So Amorim has a mountain to climb. "
7809,Man United,"lack of intensity has nothing to with fitness levels. it's just that Eriksen and casemiro were playing in the role of the pressing midfielders and they aren't just mobile enough to that. Not only that their positioing to receive the ball from our CBs weren't that good as you can see threy struggle to make progressive passes in the first half. that improved when uguarte came on. 

Since this is completely new system (not a 433 or a 442) most of our players would not have played in back 3 system, hence the issue of intensity. I think its only in Jan (at the earliest) we can realistically start looking and saying where the issues are in terms of players. The one thing is that the EPL is miles ahead of the Primeira Liga, and so Amorim cannot expect his tactics to just work, he must also make adjustments for this league. 

the last thing is that i will make a prediction, both Rashford and Garnacho will have no place in this team, if we keep this formation, and will be sold. Eriksen played in a back 3 system for Poch and Conte at Inter. He's just too old now for what RA needs from that position"
7810,Man United,"Remember the players moaned about how much running they had to do under EtH, which came out in the media after he got sacked. 

Maybe there is an issue with a lot of our squad who don't actually want to work hard. They moaned because if they didn’t win, he had them back in training the next day to do running drills, and if he didn’t have a shit system they might have just won more games. >Maybe there is an issue with a lot of our squad who don't actually want to work hard.

That's a load of bullshit."
7811,Man United,Not really fitness but intensity especially during the press. Most of our players stop after the first action when sustained pressure would've meant we regain the ball 
7812,Man United,Because we have a very slow team so they are having to expend more energy when defending. Other players fast jogs are almost full sprints for some of our players. 
7813,Man United,"ETH was a disasterclass in fitness management. With games coming thick and fast, and us losing the matches, he insisted on more running in training, rather than focusing on rest and recovery. 

To be very honest, under such stringent schedules that our players have, the only real option for physical condition baseline improvement is during preseason. During the season, you can only focus on rest and recovery in between matches. Yeah I think we're the wheels really came off is that his system meant the players were running too much and then his training doubled down with even more running. And you could see the consequences. The players so often looked destroyed. It’s a balancing act- you have to maintain fitness while ensuring the team isn’t leggy come matchday.

As you’ve pointed out, our players probably had too intense a schedule, which affected performances of a weekend. 

They absolutely need to be fit enough to work harder, but by the same measure we have to be in a position to do that when it counts- running your arse off on a Thursday morning is lovely, but if it means you’re gassed by 3:23pm on a Saturday it’s all for nothing. Players were getting injured by the minute. His system made it even worse with those crazy gaps the players had to run tirelessly to cover So why aren't they super fit now? I'm not buying this. ETH bended far too much to them and it cost him his job."
7814,Man United,It's not fitness it's laziness. 
7815,Man United,Maybe the answer is simply that we just don’t have a team of elite athletes. Bang average players playing for an elite club 
7816,Man United,"Makes me wonder if it's actually a fitness issue or an attitude issue. 

After all, these are seasoned pros playing the best part of 100 games a year for club & country. They are definitely fit. "
7817,Man United,We have players that just don't want to try as hard as they can every single game and training session. A load of offer paid wasters really. Move them on ama for goods fake please stop playing Sanford and sell him. If he was from Algeria we would have sold him 5 years ago. 
7818,Man United,Ten Hag - not single-handledly - stripped the side of physicality. Maybe. 
7819,Man United,"> Too many times under new management the first couple games are a fairytale and we get carried away

Never forget the outright shock when we beat Swansea 4-1 in Moyes' first league game. That was so funny. Or 5-1 against Cardiff in Ole’s first game. Oh how sweetvthe feeling was after years of Jose hot mess. I’d hardly say it was a shock. We had just come back off a title winning win under Fergie. It was an aging squad, but he was hardly managing a lower-half of the table club to a league title."
7820,Man United,"And also, when you look at the second half in isolation, United were pretty good in a footballing sense. They retained more possession and had passages of quick one-touch football that were easy on the eye.

But you're right; the entire squad of players will need to get up to speed with Amorim's system, and that will take some time. Thankfully we're done with international breaks for a while. This was my take as well. I actually saw promising signs albeit things were sloppy. You can see the players trying to understand the system which encouraging for their first time playing this system, emphasis on system not formation.

You can clearly see a strong desire from the team to keep possession of the ball, because the system is a possession based one. There was few occasions where the counter was on but the cycled the ball instead, which is a big departure from what we did prior to

People always seem ready with pitchforks about everything. The improvements were massive in that respect. I don't think he was happy we lost the ball as often as we did but under ETH it felt a bit like hot potato."
7821,Man United,"Honestly we need to focus on getting less injury-prone players. During most of Ten Hag's tenure we had critical players out - and after a certain point we can't keep using it as an excuse. If we ALWAYS have important players out, we need to change strategy

  
Also we need to learn how to play even WITHOUT critical players, something Ten Hag clearly couldn't do. Great managers learn how to make do with the current players they have, while Ten Hag would just keep complaining about it and wouldn't adapt "
7822,Man United,"Yeah I know we see maguire occasionally get caught out but on the ball he is actually very good. Especially for England. I think a Maguire De Ligt and Martinez back three can work and then get Yoro in when he’s ready I don't really feel like he's that good on the ball in certain conditions though. He seems good on the ball with time and space ahead of him, he can move forward and protect the ball, even pick out a pass. The problem I see with him on the ball is under any sort of pressure, especially in wider positions. He has been the direct cause of some dreadful goals over the years making both Onana and ddg look like a pair of mugs when he hail Mary's a ball backwards into space. He can't break the initial press and keep the ball going forward, he turns like a truck and then there is already someone pressing the goalie. I've also never seen him use a quick one two to just avoid that press. As for the midfield I know people won’t like it but Bruno would be good in that centre mid role next to Ugarte. Works hard, not afraid of a tackle, can play some good passes forward and get into space for the CBs Hazza used to be known for carrying the ball out of defence and making line breaking passes when he was at Leicester"
7823,Man United,"Also the likes of Scalvini in Atalanta. He just takes the ball from CB, moves on with it, or makes plays with the midfielders, etc. If United has the money, and if he is fit, I would be on him - or someone his style. 

But probably Amorim plays it safe and snatches one of our Sporting CBs :D "
7824,Man United,There was so many times I was thinking - the CBs are just not quick enough. They were always a couple of yards off getting to the ball first etc. 
7825,Man United,"Rashford is done. There's very little evidence of him ever displaying the kind of intensity Amorim wants from his team. If he wasn't going to do it against Ipswich, in the new coach's first game, straight after an international break where he didn't play a game, then there isn't a chance of him doing it consistently throughout the season.

If Amorim indulges him the way Ten Hag did, he's gone in 2 years. I have thought this for a while as well. On any other top team, if a player got so few results in an attacking position, they wouldn't be playing very often. But some guys get their spot, and it feels like there's nothing they could do to lose it, and this breeds the complacency we see from Rashford and others."
7826,Man United,"I really hope he can win serie A. Out of all players he really deserves it. Maybe next season. This season hopefully mctominay wins it Amongst all of EtH’s fuck ups at the club, the manner in which he exited DdG was not good. 

DdG had to be replaced but he deserved a much, much better send off than a last min contract rescinding and a cold call."

They’re both insane Yes, no need to put one down, both are good keepers."

7832,Man United,Looks like he's back to his old tricks 
7833,Man United,would be funny if he wins them the league 
7834,Man United,"Is he considered a success there so far?


I know it took him a while to find/pick a club but as a 90s football Italia fan when I saw he joined the club of Batistuta and Rui Costa etc I was so happy for him. Proper historic club and such wonderful kit.  Not a fan of Fiorentina but every few weeks we see some crazy ass saves from him, so I guess he’s doing pretty well Yes he's been great. He's averaging +0.25 post shot expected goals saved per 90 which is really good. For reference the last 6 seasons with us he was always hovering at 0 which is basically performing completely averagely. 

Onana is averaging +0.35 in comparison, so he's having an even better season. But de Gea is close in shot stopping this season. Last year Onana was only averaging +0.06"
7835,Man United,"Great job by de gea but also horrendous finishing. Everybody knows De gea won't leave the line but at least make him move along the line lmao. De Gea usually gets the credit he deserves for his reflexes, but his most underrated attribute in my opinion is his shot anticipation and positioning. I've lost count of the number of times that I've heard commentators say ""that's a poor finish, was shot straight at him"", but De Gea made it look that way because he had an insane knack for anticipating where exactly an attacker would be most likely to shoot in a given situation. He would then position himself so that the shot would be within arms' (or legs') reach most of the time.


In a sense, it is similar to when an elite forward keeps outperforming their xG year after year. At some point, it ceases to be an accident."
7836,Man United,Dave can Save!

7846,Man United,Great keeper treated like crap by the bald fraud Pep wasn’t that mean to him 
7847,Man United,"i dunno why we keep sharing these videos. He's gone guys Probably a former's red watch, i guess. A lot of United fans like to see how longstanding servants of the club do after they leave here. Whilst DDG wasn’t a youth player for us, he was only 20 when he joined so obviously he spent the vast majority of his professional career here. 

If it’s against the sub rules, then it should be taken down, but I personally like seeing how McT, Angel Gomes, Fernandez etc do - especially as I don’t follow the leagues they play in. There’s a whole flair for it, Former Reds, McTominay and Keane get posted under it. Have you been in this sub a day? We do that all the time here So some people can act all high and mighty when Onana has a bad run of form. Exactly"
7848,Man United,"How did we downgrade from big dave whoever agreed to it should never work in football again Onana is comfortably the better keeper in 2024. Deluded United fans living in the past, nothing new."

Oh no, the highest paid goalkeeper in the world was so hard done by. I see this often but I never agree, he was paid a metric fuck tonne and had for the last maybe 3 seasons, dropped stinkers. Like I love DDG, it makes me happy he's doing well, but if you want a modern play out of the from back keeper, he ain't the guy for it and he will cause a lot of mistakes. I don't see it as EtH's issue, if DDG had maybe said I don't mind playing backup, helping younger players, whatever, but taken a lesser role on a smaller contract, he could have stayed, but he was angling for more (which is his right, he was getting on a bit) but he was angling for more, in a situation where he didn't have leeway and the manager wanted another keeper who fitted the style better

I'd have loved him to get a proper send off, but the revisionism that EtH fucked him over is wild and imo very wrong"

He arguably is a club legend but that doesn't change anything, it is business and both sides have a big part to play in how it all turned out, would you have liked them to honour their initial unsigned contract for the sake of acknowledging his long tenure at the club after they realised their mistake in wages and extensions?

I couldn't stand the arse licking of Dave during that saga and I cannot now, it didn't all go to plan like many things don't but the way people then, and now, make it sound like poor Dave was hard done by is just tiresome.

He also did PR for the club with sponsors regularly. 

It's not as simple as people think. Hence why our managers look like they've aged a decade after just a few games. I've always thought this for all the post game interviews, like game ends at 5pm and I bet the poor bastards are doing interviews 90 minutes later PSG's manager said he would gladly take a big pay cut if it meant he wouldn't have to do any interviews at all, just coach the team. I imagine a lot of managers would feel the same way. SAF also regularly copped fines for various reasons for not attending interviews."
7921,Man United,"Good. Banning some journalists would also be great Get Luckhurst and Custis perma banned is a good thing to start with *SAF turns* 

""Make sure he's not at the next one."" I'd ban sky first. All this utd pundits along with Cara can fuck off. They bring more bad press than good. And Jamie Jackson Club Statement coming? Banning the entire media towards United would be great honestly."
7922,Man United,"Allowing Ed Sheeran rock up and crash the interview was incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional from Sky. 

Would like to know how Ed would feel if someone crashed one of his interviews. You can clearly see how pissed off Ruben was when this happened too.. he put his head down thinking what the fuck is going on here, Sheeran just come for a chinwag with redknapp during this interview just seen the clip, so awkward and uncalled for Like wtf? It was like, I'm Ed Sheeran fuck you. The disrespect. Need Ruben to show up to his next concert on stage, high five the bandmates and take the mic away from Ed for a speech. I’d suggest that Ruben pops on stage the next time ginger pubes is in Manchester playing the songs he’s ripped off other artists. But that means exposing Ruben to Ed Sheerans songs Absolutely pathetic from Sky, he's trying to talk tactics while the rest (barring Keane) are too busy giggling about Ed Sheeran."
7923,Man United,Speaking to Gary Neville was the final straw xD There really was no need for that. Club should've stopped that already. Bad job from the comms person It would be for most people
7924,Man United,"Not surprised tbh. Media rival,  fans ex players, former ex players. Too much limelight on the manager. 

Fuck this. Help the manager Focus solely on his job not the circus surrounding this massi the club. Fcking Ed Sheeran even want to ride the wave too.. mf."
7925,Man United,"He should be given time with his team not with the media.... It's called ""media duties"", part of the job but totally agreed that it should be kept to a bare minimum."
7926,Man United,"Fairplay to him. Considering how bloody Sky just allow Ed Sheeran to just crash the interview.

You can clearly see he is fuming internally. Proper disrespectful. Nobody affiliated with the opposition should be anywhere near an interview. You can always tell from Sky's coverage that they're desperate to get that short clip they can spam all over their social media channels. They're a joke nowadays.

It was incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional. Quite Rightly tbf"
7927,Man United,Good on him 
7928,Man United,My man’s just asked the press to kindly fuck off Said what we are all thinking.
7929,Man United,"Really happy about this. I don't want to make excuses for ETH, but I believe it's this impossible amount of pressure that made him fail so spectacularly. His abandonment of his tactics and refusing to lessen the intensity of training were clear signs of that.

Shouldn't really compare to Tottenham because obviously the standards are not the same, but look at the way Ange has been treated. He's had a similar record to ETH this year, but he's sticking to his guns, gets praised when it works, but nobody's talking about his sacking when it doesn't. He's allowed to work.

Obviously it's Manchester United and if you're the ""right man"" you need to be able to handle all the pressure that comes with it and like Pep once said ""results buy you time"" but I'm really hoping we can rally behind the man and let him do his thing instead of having to worry about the now and sacrificing long term goals. There's a lot more work to do than there was at City in 2016. I think ETH's time at United will be an interesting case study once some time has passed, but I do think that you're right - the pressure got to him in the end, his decisions around team selection (he'd drop well performing players claiming rotation on the cusp of an international break) and statements to the press (refusing to acknowledge poor performances) started to be less and less logical and that makes people think if you aren't seeing the same thing as me and it seems so obvious then how can you come up with a solution? 



Ange is an interesting comparison to ETH, to be honest there's been a fair amount of complaining over Spurs' performances this season and people questioning if he should go, it's just such a competitive league that anyone can beat anyone and any team is 1-2 results away from a ""crisis"". 



If you look back at some of the earlier results this season we were playing well, improved stats on last year, but weren't getting results - the Palace and Brighton games in my opinion are perfect examples of that - and once the results weren't there the confidence dipped and it started to fall apart. Confidence is a magical thing, can make mighty men mice, and vice versa."
7930,Man United,Good. 
7931,Man United,"Good, all that shit can’t help a manager "
7932,Man United,"Loved this, control everything everywhere, show them who's the boss. Put the feet down on the shit stirrers. "
7933,Man United,Good. He can't shout Portuguese obscenities at the referee if he's lost his voice. 
7934,Man United,"The MUTV interviews after or before a match are kind of the most pointless ones. The broadcasters would take multiple interviews on the same thing, why bother the manager with one more of the same? "
7935,Man United,I hope it is possible because I would not be surprised if he quickly loses his smile if he keeps answering stupid questions week in and week out. 
7936,Man United,"As much as I like to hear him speak about the squad, I think that's a good idea. Way too much limelight on us. "
7937,Man United,This is honestly the best change he can make. Negative media is unironically the downfall of UTD 
7938,Man United,Good. Getting a bit tired of the commercial focus of this club and obsession with getting constant engagement. Guy will just end up saying the same stuff 10 times over. Let's be a football club for once. 
7939,Man United,Good love it the commercial shit needs to calm down 
7940,Man United,![gif](giphy|iee0AS1H9Le7u) 
7941,Man United,Music to my ears 
7942,Man United,Good. Less talk. More work. 
7943,Man United,"I said this last week, seeing all the video of him covering absolutely every aspect of his day to day, seemingly capturing and displaying every second of his every move, and constantly seeking comment from him… it’s pervasive… obnoxious… "
7944,Man United,"poor guy was trying to as nice as possible and already got tired of this english media bs He thought they were nice as well, but they just put on a friendly mask to get the most out of him, like that ex Valencia coach. When things go bad inevitably after Man City & Arsenal away, they will shit on him for weeks"
7945,Man United,How dare he sound like a competent head coach 
7946,Man United,"We cry about how the media always talk about us but the club also wants to be talked about. Exactly.
I fully agree that it's often a waste of time, but it should be noted that a) it's a part of the broadcasting deals and it's paid for, b) it's part of the clubs branding strategy.

Of course the first week with a new coach will come with extra attention, but there will be a lot of coverage always.

I, however wouldn't mind if press duties were split between Amorim, an ass.manager, Wilcox and Ashworth."
7947,Man United,Love this. 
7948,Man United,Excellent 
7949,Man United,"Tbh this is so long overdue. Considering the messages are all manacured anyway might as well send someone from the club out to just give injury updates. 

Like is there literal contractual obligations from the club to have press conferences etc ? 

Like they are generally a total waste of everyone’s time not sure why we bother apart from broadcasters wanting it "
7950,Man United,"Get it done, if they are desperate for access, give them youth players, give them fringe players, give them the occasional starters, give them directors etc etc etc

Let this man cook "
7951,Man United,"Love this. I actually wouldn't mind not seeing Amorim do any interviews for the next few months.

Send out some assistant coaches to give generic answers.

In some weeks, leak out that Amorim will do a presser only to send out the Goalkeeping coach instead.

Starve this pricks of journalists and the English media in general from Amorim access.

We all know they have got drafts upon drafts ready to bash him the moment we lose a match:

**""A step too big for Amorim""**

**""Did INEOS make a mistake sacking ETH""**

**""Portugese league is a different animal to the premier league""**

**""Amorim out of his depth?""**

**""EXCLUSIVE: United stars unconvinced with Amorim's training methods""** "
7952,Man United,"Interviews before and after the game. 15 minutes tops.

Most organisations in the world don't allow for meetings more than 30 minutes in a week as it becomes a distraction and here media wants more time than that every 3 days. Most organisations? Never seen that"
7953,Man United,Didn’t Pochettino get out of interviews for years because he couldn’t speak English? Should have tried that. 
7954,Man United,"Honestly, I feel these are the sort of situations director of footballs or someone in the upper management really need to step in. You got a new head coach, specifically not a manager. You also are responsible for success of the football side, wouldn't you butt your way in to press conferences so you can free up your new head coaches' time? Just run your mouth on why you chose Amorim will be enough to sate most of the presses' appetite. 

Gone are the days of the all powerful manager like Fergie who control everything. But managers like him and Mourinho was master of deflecting attention from his players when needed. If Amorim is not the ""manager"", then who is? "
7955,Man United,"Welcome to the PL unfortunately, I'm not sure how well this strategy will go down.


You've got a media who are desperate to see him fail and turn the guy into meme and it feels like this is just ammunition for them to start shit stirring. "
7956,Man United,"Yeah, this is on United.

Do they want ‘engagement’ and ‘likes’ or do they want to leave the coach to coach the team. "
7957,Man United,His comments did remind me that it’s a lot. Not sure if it’s just something we should just accept as part and parcel of the show that is the Premier League? Can we even limit the amount of media commitments or are they contractual that all managers have to do? And/or do the managers of the big clubs have more media commitments? 
7958,Man United,"Clubs have put a pretty fine point on the fact that the ""manager"" of yesteryear and the ""head coach"" of today are two very distinct concepts. I think it's pretty fair for him to say ""if you're telling me to focus on coaching the team, how about I do exactly that"" "
7959,Man United,LOL. I was downvoted for stating that we were giving way too much exposure of the manager (sorry head coach) and our tactics to the media. 
7960,Man United,not rimming but every statement from this man has such clarity of thought and action 
7961,Man United,You could see it in his eyes behind his beautiful smile. The EMBARGOED interview and his interview with Neville was so draining 
7962,Man United,🤣🤣 
7963,Man United,"I'd love for us to go total blackout other than team news with the media but it ain't happening when your the utd manager unfortunately 


Sky need us to because who else they gonna make click bait bullshit articles about & get equivalent engagement lmao "
7964,Man United,Not gonna blame the manager this time thou whatever happens. Club needs to sort it shit together. We have done this circus a thousand times. Club needs to prioritise what it wants. Enough of this media circus. Ban some of these ass clowns. 
7965,Man United,I'd do pre and post and that's it. Media can fuck off. Parasite vulture cancers. 
7966,Man United,Amorin is more of a head coach than of a manager that we commonly associate with in the Premier league. He is more concerned and concentrated with what happens on the training ground. 
7967,Man United,Good. 
7968,Man United,I would send my assistant. 
7969,Man United,Just get someone else out to do the interviews. It's all bollucks anyway 
7970,Man United,You could tell he was sick of saying the same shit. And then that little ginger cut him off on sky 
7971,Man United,Makes sense. Even the players posting good training session is such a shit thing to do. 
7972,Man United,Bravo. 
7973,Man United,"No wonder managers start looking haggard, the amount of interviews they have to do after ever game is ridiculous, you must be shattered by the end of the day "
7974,Man United,"He won’t be able to shy away I suppose. All the broadcasters would want an interview of their own—the British broadcaster, the world broadcaster, the pl, match of the day, mutv… I do not know how many more before he gets to the press. 

Welcome to the best league in the world, Ruben! "
7975,Man United,Just hire back round please 
7976,Man United,Good. I think this is one of the issues most mangers have had. Let me cook. Stop asking them what they are cooking and when will it be ready. 
7977,Man United,and this is why every manager will fail at Man Utd in the modern era. 
7978,Man United,"In football manager, I always assign the media stuff to the assistant manager. And I’ve won multiple leagues and champions leagues with United. Just saying…. "
7979,Man United,"Damn straight, if INEOS want him to be head coach and not a 'manager,' then saddling him with the pressure of the media engagement is a slap in the face - Ashworth should be handling it as DoF. "
7980,Man United,Amorim is already looking tired after one game 
7981,Man United,"Yes it’s a lot to have to cope with for just £6.7m a year, he needs to ask for a rise! "
7982,Man United,"Cannot blame him, constant media scrutiny and circus-like environment can be overwhelming, let him focus on winning games. "
7983,Man United,More wins less talk!  TBH I’d prefer if he talked less and let the results speak for him. 
7984,Man United,"Though the media attention and duties are part of being a manager at this size of club I do sympathise.

Every cough and sneeze is studied and reported on with 15 different angles and opinions. "
7985,Man United,Manutd is a Football club and a PR company rolled into 1 unfortunately 
7986,Man United,Wonder if we will ever see clubs appointing a 'manager' on the surface that has to do all the PR bullshit whilst the real manager gets chance to actually do their job. That would be some nice pie in the face for all these broadcasters and sponsors with their onerous requirements. 
7987,Man United,"If he's having issues with the media just after the first game, Unfortunately, I don't think he'll last very long here. "
7988,Man United,"Do they not have press conferences in Portugal? I feel like he hasn't done a ridiculous amount outside that. There was the Neville interview and the one for the club? In Portugal you just have press conferences before and after the match. And that’s it . Sometimes they do a special interview whit the champion Manager of that year but Amorim for example never did that expect a podcast in Sporting youtube channel. The man doesn’t even reads the papers, he 100% focus in his job and players. there's one pre-match press conference (the day before a match), and one after the match. Sometimes there's quick interviews right on the pitch when the match ends, but apart from that, not really Of course they do lol. You underestimate how many interviews he has to do. There's been the United museum tour, the club interview, Neville interview, an interview with a Portuguese woman in English, a pre game interview by the club, press conference, post match interview and that's not including the probably many other interviews he does before/after games with different media like Sky, BT, whatever."
7989,Man United,"I've always thought this for all the post game interviews, like game ends at 5pm and I bet the poor bastards are doing interviews 90 minutes later They are. And there’s no chance for a debrief with the players. 

I’d be surprised if Amorim is allowed to reduce/skip any. Glazers rinse that media exposure and United get clicks."
7990,Man United,"PSG's manager said he would gladly take a big pay cut if it meant he wouldn't have to do any interviews at all, just coach the team. I imagine a lot of managers would feel the same way. Need to hire a second coach just to waffle to the press or ask your ass man to do all the interviews like in FM.

(if only it is that easy) This is why I always have the assistant coach do media stuff in Football Manager. :)"
7991,Man United,SAF also regularly copped fines for various reasons for not attending interviews. 
7992,Man United,Get Luckhurst and Custis perma banned is a good thing to start with Gary Cotterill too while we're at it If it were up to me I'd just have the TotD lads take the press conference every week Dude Luckhurst has some of the worst takes. I’ve only ever heard him on podcast and he’s unbearable. The United stand too
7993,Man United,"*SAF turns* 

""Make sure he's not at the next one."" "
7994,Man United,I'd ban sky first. All this utd pundits along with Cara can fuck off. They bring more bad press than good. 
7995,Man United,And Jamie Jackson 
7996,Man United,Club Statement coming? 
7997,Man United,Banning the entire media towards United would be great honestly. 
7998,Man United,"You can clearly see how pissed off Ruben was when this happened too.. he put his head down thinking what the fuck is going on here, Sheeran just come for a chinwag with redknapp during this interview "
7999,Man United,"just seen the clip, so awkward and uncalled for "
8000,Man United,"Like wtf? It was like, I'm Ed Sheeran fuck you. The disrespect. "
8001,Man United,"Need Ruben to show up to his next concert on stage, high five the bandmates and take the mic away from Ed for a speech. "
8002,Man United,I’d suggest that Ruben pops on stage the next time ginger pubes is in Manchester playing the songs he’s ripped off other artists. But that means exposing Ruben to Ed Sheerans songs May be playing The long and winding road to shut Ed down ;)
8003,Man United,"Absolutely pathetic from Sky, he's trying to talk tactics while the rest (barring Keane) are too busy giggling about Ed Sheeran. "
8004,Man United,"There really was no need for that. Club should've stopped that already. Bad job from the comms person If you give Gary interviews, he talks kindly about the club and the people in charge. It’s easy PR. 

I don’t like it, but it’s part of the game. I think it's okay for the start, like he said. He said he did everything for that week, now he wants to focus on his coaching. I think thats fair and a good balance."
8005,Man United,It would be for most people 
8006,Man United,Fcking Ed Sheeran even want to ride the wave too.. mf. 
8007,Man United,"It's called ""media duties"", part of the job but totally agreed that it should be kept to a bare minimum. "
8008,Man United,Proper disrespectful. Nobody affiliated with the opposition should be anywhere near an interview. It looked like he was hanging about near where the interview was taking place so he was ushered over. Anything for clicks and engagement. Bizarre.
8009,Man United,"You can always tell from Sky's coverage that they're desperate to get that short clip they can spam all over their social media channels. They're a joke nowadays.

It was incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional. "

8020,Newcastle,He does this all the time because it is engagement bait for ad revenue on Twitter 
8021,Newcastle,"Isn’t Mouth of the Tyne that Burnsie gimp? He must be pushing 30 and still going on like a weapon 😂 sad but not surprising He's probably already created his next 5 burners to defend himself against that West Ham account. They need to section him, he blocks anyone that questions or disagrees with him and then he has hour long chats with his burner accounts. Such a weird guy Burnsie shags aliens."
8022,Newcastle,"The West Ham fans were good yesterday, loud and pretty friendly, they’re not a bad bunch. Out of all the London clubs West Ham and Fulham have the soundest supporters."
8023,Newcastle,That twitter account should be an instant mute for all concerned. 
8024,Newcastle,"Burnsie doesn't count as ""Human"" "
8025,Newcastle,"Well lads, I've learned a lot about the guy running that account, thanks for that! 

On a sidenote, can we agree at 2-0 down with 10 to go, Osula just gets to come on and have a go? Agree. He couldn't exactly make anything worse, so why not? He's had 4 months of training with Eddie. He should be ready for 10 minutes at the end of a match. Though at that point we made our last sub and Bruno needed to come off due to having a knock. > Well lads, I've learned a lot about the guy running that account, thanks for that!

8026,Newcastle,"MOTT is a absolute numpty but note the timing if the tweets - his was sent at half time (note ""48 mins"") and it was true, first half we battered them. Second half we absolutely fell off a cliff. "
8027,Newcastle,"The West Ham fan comment here is spot on really. I dunno I think West Ham and Newcastle have a weird synergy as clubs that just can't break a ceiling. Supporters are very similar too. Both as loyal and hysterical as each other.  Maybe I think that cos one of my best friends supports them and it's us surrounded by Man Utd Arsenal etc.

& Mouth of the Tyne is just a tit. Glad I don't use Twitter. "
8028,Newcastle,"It’s Burnsie, no doubt 1 of his other accounts will be in the responses saying he’s being harsh. "
8029,Newcastle,West Ham Place is also one of the soundest Football Twitter accounts out there too 
8030,Newcastle,"I see no lies tbh, they were really poor until the second goal. The wording is unnecessarily provocative, but he's right we really should've been out of sight before they got the second. I actually quite like West Ham, but I don't think its out of order to point out they were poor.

Kelly had a generational hooner and for some reason the lads (and the crowd) seemed to give up after the second. "
8031,Newcastle,"""That counts for nothing"" absolutely right mate. If they gave style points to decide matches i reckon we'd all be rightly pissed off. "
8032,Newcastle,"We didn't outclass them though, we were absolutely shite, can't claim that trash last night and the Brighton game are the same. "

8037,Newcastle,"Agree. He couldn't exactly make anything worse, so why not? He's had 4 months of training with Eddie. He should be ready for 10 minutes at the end of a match. Aye the lads hungry, him running at tired defences would surely help in that stage of a match too."

Edit: American here. I don’t think Leeds is in London. They do both start with an L but pretty sure Leeds is on west yorkshire which I don’t know if that’s a suburb of London or not but just gonna assume I’m wrong It's almost 200 miles. Nah, Yorkshire is in the North of England, London is South East. It's a good 4 or 5 hour drive from one to the other. Leeds is one of the biggest cities in England, so definitely not a suburb either."
8041,Newcastle,"Aye the lads hungry, him running at tired defences would surely help in that stage of a match too. "
8042,Newcastle,It's almost 200 miles. Which in Britain is actually a long way. Trust us.

Leeds is one of the biggest cities in England, so definitely not a suburb either. And even if it was a suburb of London, are we really calling Leeds supporters sound. Thanks for the knowledge, In retrospect I should've googled."
8044,Newcastle,Which in Britain is actually a long way. Trust us.

8048,Newcastle,Yep ! I knew it myself 
8049,Newcastle,When my two favourite things collide It's always sunny in Newcastle
8050,Newcastle,It happens. West Ham were due for a win against us. We just played poorly. And Pawson and VAR apparently don't feel that headlocking Wilson is a pen. Amazing that...🙄 
8051,Newcastle,As soon as I saw the level or arrogance from our fanbase regarding this game (go look at the pre match thread) I had a bad feeling and we totally shit the bed 
8052,Newcastle,"To echo some other thoughts on here...  plus my own...

One of the worst results of the Eddie Howe era for me. The cup final capitulation against a terrible Utd side, Milan at home, Forest at home on Boxing Day and... last night.
Sure, we should have had a penalty, there was an offside goal and a couple of chances that should have gone in (Looking at the Isak one) but that was a Mags side that has to win games like that. Would have put them in 6th and carried on some great form.

International break comes at the wrong time for some sides. 😶
Still, it's early days and a few players will/are coming back from injury (Even so, that was a STACKED bench of talent and didn't produce the comeback I think most fans expected.) and anybody seems to beat anybody this season so who knows what top six will look like at end of season.

8054,Newcastle,Horror show yesterday. 
8055,Newcastle,"No-one will believe me but I did have a bad feeling going into this one, same way I had a good feeling going into Forest. Hasn't lessened the anguish though.

Says a lot that Fulham and West Ham have both beaten us this season, teams we've typically had the better of under Howe. "

8060,Newcastle,Well fuck A win vs Palace away takes us back to +1
8061,Newcastle,When I said I wanted us to stop losing so many away games I did not mean to lose home ones instead.... 
8062,Newcastle,"A set of results that screams midtable, so 10th is about what we deserve. "
8063,Newcastle,A win vs Palace away takes us back to +1 Winning at Selhurst isn't something we do.
8064,Newcastle,"Winning at Selhurst isn't something we do. Tbf by the lack of greens. Winning away isn’t something we do either. Winning at the Molineux isn’t something we usually do, so I hope we can have a repeat of that. Especially since losing to West Ham isn’t something we usually do either."
8065,Newcastle,Tbf by the lack of greens. Winning away isn’t something we do either. 
8066,Newcastle,"Winning at the Molineux isn’t something we usually do, so I hope we can have a repeat of that. Especially since losing to West Ham isn’t something we usually do either. "
8067,Newcastle,"Howe needs to seriously start to consider another formation or look to set up differently when he knows it’ll be a low block - Mr Paqueta and Max Kilman barely had to get out of second gear yesterday against us, just not good enough at all "
8068,Newcastle,"We were fucking crap. 

Howe got it wrong and the players underperformed.

Here endeth my in-depth analysis. "
8069,Newcastle,"It was the same performance as regularly happens since teams worked us out. They sit in, let us have the ball and exploit us on the break, exactly what we are great at against the better teams. 

Howe is getting naive with games like that, the squad isn’t utilised right, Tonali should start games we know we’ll dominate the ball, not longstaff, he is a work horse in games we have to graft to be in. 

And the squad building hasn’t been good, this falls on ownership and Howe, we need a RW and a genuine number 10 playmaker so that in games like last night we can play 4231 and have someone picking up those pockets of space. 

The most annoying thing is Howe clearly realised this in part given how much we pushed for Maddison, but then when we didn’t get him he just abandoned that line of thought. 

Ultimately now we are exactly what we are, a mid table team who is capable of competing against any in the league but not nearly good enough or consistent enough to push the top 3, city, Liverpool Arsenal are a cut above, we fall into the next bracket with Villa, spurs, man united, but we are bottom of that list given our lack of spending power. 

The squad needs a major overhaul, and key positions need to be addressed as soon as possible. 

No more sentimentality around players who have been at the club lengths of time, the likes of lascelles etc have to be moved on. 

I also think this is howes last season, he’s lost supporters in the board room. Unless he wins something then I think come summer it’s new manager, new direction transfer wise, utilising Mitchell’s moneyball approach and scoring Europe for the best deals. Howe was the perfect match for us getting out of relegation. IMO too good as ppl start dreaming of him carrying us in europe and securing top 3-4 every season. I dont think it will happen with Howe. Sure, we need new players in several areas but sooner or later we need a new mindset from a coaching perspective aswell. Will be gutted when he leaves, either by his own or sacked :( I’d hate to be your laundry maid. You must have so many wet nights. 

Last night wasn’t our night. We were overconfident, lost Willock (our only player who can link up in final third) and shat ourselves when they scored. 

It’s not a crisis. Howe doesn’t need to go (although I get your point that others may and good faith between club and fans will start diminishing) and the only reason we are poor transfer wise is because we ain’t sold anyone, because our legacy players are from Mike Ashley’s cardboard sock tray under the air curtain of every Sp*rts direct store."
8070,Newcastle,"Gordan and Isak had absolute stinkers last night but seem to have flown under the radar criticism wise. 

Only players really to come out of that with much credit are Hall, Bruno and to a lesser extent Joelinton. 

Longstaff was over criticised, he wasn’t great but I could name at least 5 worse. I disagree, I thought Isak was doing his best in a team that could not feed him enough chances yet again.

He's overtrying and overdribbling because there is never any good support or balls to his feet. He had one difficult chance missed and the rest, he was offside because the ball came in late. Our wingers and midfielders are absolute pants in supplying the ball.

Not to say he's undroppable but everytime I watch him make great runs - nobody is capable of picking him up.. Yeah I thought Gordon was really poor I disagree: I thought Bruno was poor too. 

Hall did OK, though he did get completely skinned by Bowen a couple of times (including before the corner that they scored from) and his crossing was poor.

Tino and Joelinton both did *OK* but again didn’t create much. Switching to 442 to accommodate both Isak and Wilson upfront did not work. I hope we never play this formation again. Isak has been shocking all season. He constantly loses the ball in promising positions. Always trying to take people on and getting tackled leading to dangerous counters. His finishing ability also seems to have deserted him. I'd bench him for Wilson as soon as he's fit again. Longstaff wasn’t over-criticised IMO, you’re a complete man down in midfield with him - can’t attack nor defend and he just loses the ball killing attack and helping their attacks - sincerely a player that shouldn’t even be near our bench let alone starting 11"
8071,Newcastle,"Reckon the exact same will happen on Saturday. Playing an out of form team whose manager is under pressure, they’ll get an early goal sit back and we’ll have absolutely no idea how to break them down. I’d take glasner if the worst comes"
8072,Newcastle,"The team looked flat and dejected after the second goal went in which was concerning. There was still a lot of time left, where was the passion and fight. "
8073,Newcastle,"We didn’t play like a team who would have went 2 points off 2nd and 1 point off 3rd last night. It was an absolute embarrassment of a performance all around really, highlighted a lot of our naivety, and no one seemed to want to grab the game by the scruff of the neck and drive us forward. Lots of missed passes, and errors. Not the good start to the winter period of games coming thick and fast. 

Have to hope that’s the kick up the arse to go get something off palace. But losing these games is what costs you Europe at the end of the season. Got to be aiming for the conference place this season given how tight everything is in the league. 

Hopefully this games meant the owners will be looking at some new players to come in to replace the gaps we have in the squad/first team (Joelinton on RW, CB, and in an ideal world another CDM and number 10). "
8074,Newcastle,"I'm increasingly worried about our upcoming transfer windows, the squad needs a big overhaul and I'm not sure who's there to fund it. Most of our defence is the wrong side of thirty and beyond the ""crown jewels"" we've not really go salable assets. Yeah Howe has his faults but the lack of APTs to increase revenues to help us reach ""number 1"" is concerning. If you can't change the squad all you can change is the manager. I think we need to sell Isak for the funds, and longstaff just to free us from that trap. No point having isak atm as we can't create chances. Need a rw and dm and cb. Osula, Wilson are good enough for now and Gordon as a back up for us front. We need the cash held in isak."
8075,Newcastle,"Honestly the fact are set plays are arguably the worst for years, is enough to criticise eddie for a) keeping tindell responsibility on them, b) allowing it to continue. "
8076,Newcastle,"Feels like we've seen this type of performance one too many times this season already.

It's on the management team to sort it out. Pointless beating Arsenal, Forest, and Chelsea if we put in non-performances against the likes of West Ham, Everton, Fulham etc. 

Would any of us be surprised if we put in a typical 'Newcastle away to a London team' performance this weekend against Palace i.e. conceed early, barely get out of 2nd gear and come away with zero points? 

Something fundamentally wrong with the set up and mentality of the squad that they only seem to perform in big games at St James. "
8077,Newcastle,"My head has returned from mars so now can comment.
Definitely close to if not outright our worst performance under Howe that second half. Ole’s from west ham fans at home- embarrassing. Only positive is December period games come quick so we will have to rectify this performance asap 
Longstaff still getting pelters but joelinton, Bruno, Gordon were up there with our worst performers. Big group of games for Howe who should not be getting the sack unlike some mad people are saying but need more consistently positive results "
8078,Newcastle,Did Bruno get injured? 
8079,Newcastle,"For better or worse, Eddie Howe is a one-trick pony. Now, that doesn't mean he can't be a good one-trick pony but this season and most of last season has shown that he has the inability to change the team or have a plan B when things get tough.

His substitutions were bizarre yesterday, absolutely killed any chance of us ever getting back into the game. His beloved 4-3-3 was dismantled by himself as he decided to go full 'fuck it' mode and put on an extra striker, sacrificed central midfielders and etc for a 4-4-2 which made us absolutely useless as West Ham controlled the pace of the game effortlessly.

I'm starting to believe he has only 2 real formations, 4-3-3 and sometimes 4-5-1. And his only actual adjustments are either switching sides of Gordon and whatever other winger or switching Joelinton around. Anything else is a crapshoot and quite frankly ineffective.

When our role players like Murphy, Almiron and etc overperform, we are unstoppable. But in last season and this season, when our role players sputter, we start to see how poor our team is in terms of consistently producing results. 

Gordon is so temperamental, great when he's on it but sulking uninterested mess when things doesn't go his way. Bruno - incapable of rousing our mess of a squad will go full Hollywood and misplace passes galore. These two are some of our supposedly best players but they don't have the ability to carry this team alone. Isak, bless his soul - is continuously our most talented player but when we can't provide him clinical chances, he's going to have a tough tough time.

Cold hard facts is we have 13 goals in 12 games played (4th lowest in the league) because we can't create enough chances on the ball and this will continue. 

WE HAD 2 SHOTS ON TARGET ALL GAME YESTERDAY and none in the 2nd half when we had to score.

We can't blame injuries, fixture overload anymore - sure Howe could figure it out, but it's already gameweek 12. "
8080,Newcastle,"It was the same sort of performance we’ve been putting in for around a year now, that, sadly is now our level under Eddie Howe. What I found most frustrating is the way we responded to go behind. I would say we played well the first 10 minutes then the first goal was poor defending and a real sucker punch. But then for 10 minutes afterwards we were awful, kept giving the ball away and no composure. The last 20 minutes of the first half we played well again and created opportunities but the team collectively shat the bed after the second goal. All composure and decision making gone. Man City at their best go through the same patterns of play even if they go behind and it usually means they come back to win. When we go behind we just panic. No leadership."
8081,Newcastle,"Same as always, our finishing was poor and some of our passing was was questionable. "
8082,Newcastle,"Rewatched the second half this morning… It was worse than I remember it. 

In games like this, we need Tonali picking the ball up from the GK/defence, especially with Isak making those runs in the first half. 

3-4-3 with Lewis Miley and Bruno as 10s. 

Our wingers were redundant and ineffective in this game so get rid of them and push Hall and Livramento higher for width. Miley isn't a 10, he's a better version of Longstaff."
8083,Newcastle,Still gutted 😞 
8084,Newcastle,"We are just too predictable in attack, we don't work the ball into the box well we just cross it or cut inside from range. It would be really nice if we had someone who could break lines in the middle. Apparently Vakhtang Salia who we signed but won't be joining till the summer works decent as an attacking midfielder as well as a striker and shadow striker, I wonder if that is the longer term plan. "
8085,Newcastle,"Mark Douglas has finally talked some sense, we spent a lot of money on Bruno Tonali Gordon and Barnes, yet after a year they still can't play together.

For me, Tonali, which is more of a upgrade to Joelinton, should not have been bought unless we planned selling him at that time, I think Howe feels so bedded with Joelinton and doesn't dare dropping him, also I think he is worried about dropping him could cause issue in the changing room.

Another issue is Barnes, I still can't believe how on earth did we spent 40m for him and buy no one on the RW. We already had a lot of players who could play on the left at that time. "
8086,Newcastle,"We have conceded first goal in 7/12 EPl games this season. Our tactics isnt that convincing when we are chasing game, 2 wins 4 loss and 1 draw from 7 games when we went behind, 

Start scoring the first goal and we will get better result thats my view or atleast dont concede one in first half. "
8087,Newcastle,"We’re a mid table team playing mid table football, nothing else to it. 

It’ll be even more of a struggle when the big dogs leave in Jan/July. "
8088,Newcastle,"Positives: 
- Wilson is back and will give competition to Isak
- Lewis Hall is fantastic 

Negatives:
- Not clinical enough when we do create chances
- We don’t seem to have a second option when a team figures us out and set up a low block
- Lloyd Kelly wasn’t up to scratch in this game 

I don’t want to be too doom and gloom and on another day we could’ve won that by 2 or 3. But we lacked energy, especially in the second half and have no plan B. Feel like Isak is left too isolated up top and isn’t getting the service. Wasn't Wilson limping at the end - love the guy but wouldn't be surprised if we don't see him make the bench again for a few weeks We at no point could have won that another day. 2 shots on goal."
8089,Newcastle,The pain doesn't stop here. We've got our annual 0-0 draw (or loss depending on if Mateta turns up) at Selhurst to look forward to on Saturday... Mateta is gonna eat us alive
8090,Newcastle,One thing that really annoyed me last night even before a ball was kicked was Lewis Miley being kept off the bench by players which either aren't good enough and/or the club have actively tried to get rid of will do so again in January. I'd argue he's a better player than at least one of the midfielders who started the game too. His exclusion meant we only had one midfielder to bring on even though we subbed all three off. It's appalling from the management and is only going to harm Miley's long term development if he's given zero minutes. He's been back from injury for a long while now so that's not an excuse. 
8091,Newcastle,"Cant decide if the plan was shit, the execution of said plan was shit, or if its a combination of both. 

Currently leaning towards it being both, ive not seen us look so slow amd confused in a long time

2nd half clearly something went massively wrong, the very cynical, miserable twat in me thought the players downed tools but i am ready accept the tactical changes just confused everyone, me included "
8092,Newcastle,"I think the word stale comes to mind

Until Jan we're going to be spinning wheels I'm afraid "
8093,Newcastle,"Feels worse the day after, just so bad all round.

It feels a bit like Palace away where we stuck with the set up from the previous game against a different type of opponent and it’s just backfired. Very bad habit appearing from Eddie

Saying that with so many poor individual performances he could have coached a perfect game and we’d have lost Good job we’ve not got Palace away nex- oh."
8094,Newcastle,"Too many people blaming howe, but players just didn't perform. First goal could have been avoided, poor marking. Second goal, we let Wan-bissaka completely run free into the box while our midfield looked on. That's just poor play by players, not the fault of Howe. Main problem is our finishing. Gordon missed a point blank chance, Isak had good chances too for a player of his quality.

Last season, we scored 3 or more in 9 homes games. This season, we have not been as clinical. Only 13 goals scored in total. Last season we created the most big chances in the prem. This season we are 16th in Big chances created. Hard not to blame Howe when we’re struggling to control the midfield or create chances and he won’t play Tonali. Howe would be given a pass if this was a one off. But these exact same problems have existed throughout Howe's tenure with zero indication he has any idea how to fix them. How do you explain lots of players being off form at the same time?"
8095,Newcastle,"That wasn't as bad as people are saying, we started really strongly in both halves & conceded against the run of play twice from situations they wouldn't score in 9 times out of 10. 

West Ham defended deep with a back 5 which we struggled to breakdown & when we did get in position we squandered our chances (our xg was 1.5 to their 0.9). The more concerning part for me was after West Ham's 2nd goal when we ""went for it"" the changes didn't work & in fact made us worse. Everyone calling for Tonali to start, but I don't think he did much once he came on, although the whole team wasn't great for that last 20 minutes. 

Hopefully having Wilson back will push Isak on a level how it has done in the past. Overall though it still feels like a few key players aren't hitting the levels they are capable of (Bruno, Isak, Gordon), & you do wonder if thats a hangover from the summer - they were promised a vision, but our last two windows aren't reflecting that. "
8096,Newcastle,"New manager please, we have been bad since the turn of the year, and we get by with lucky wins or draws. This just isn't good enough. Do u not realize that there are no good managers that are available? If we sack howe it’s gonna be potter. Do u want that?"
8097,Newcastle,"People are far too reactive. We where heading for champions league after Forrest now one shit game and it’s back to the pitch forks 🤣 we will be fine. It was bad though, actually worst home atmosphere I’ve seen since the Ashley days. The players where sluggish as where we the fans. Bad night, but on another day our chances go in and we maul them. My only issue really is our complete inability to break a low block.  "
8098,Newcastle,"Italian media: AC Milan are reportedly looking at launching a £70m bid for Newcastle’s midfield maestro, Liongistaffi, who is has been keeping Tonali out the first team. Italy national team are also conducting ancestry analysis on the player to represent them at the 2026 World Cup. "
8099,Newcastle,"Howe was the perfect match for us getting out of relegation. IMO too good as ppl start dreaming of him carrying us in europe and securing top 3-4 every season. I dont think it will happen with Howe. Sure, we need new players in several areas but sooner or later we need a new mindset from a coaching perspective aswell. Will be gutted when he leaves, either by his own or sacked :( Absolutely, nothing against howe at all he’s been fantastic since he came in, not just with his management but with the way he’s carried himself and dealt with all the other stuff round the club and owners as well. 

In the end the worst thing we did was succeed too quickly, that season of 4th just catapulted expectations, from the fans but mainly from the media and outside influences. Victim of his own success now Howe, so it looks like a failure when we actually settle into where we more realistically stand in the league There’s no good alternative. Potter will be a nightmare"
8100,Newcastle,"I’d hate to be your laundry maid. You must have so many wet nights.

You're putting the pressure on him of having one chance a game in these games. Isak hasn't been great but there's valid reasons for that. Isak hasn’t set the world alight this season and I think we’ve all been hoping for him to pluck something out the air and do something special, but the balls into him have been shocking, he will score regularly if you give him the quality, look at the arsenal goal. I think a lot of these players are too comfortable in the knowledge that they are going to start.

Mind saying that Howe’s reluctance to take Isak is insane. We will drop any pretence of a logical shape to make sure he stays on the pitch - like last night. 

We could be 3-0 and Isak will play the full 90 regardless. It’s so clearly going to lead him to be fatigued and/or injured I agree with you here, Isak -having built a reputation as an incredible dribbler, is actually ranked as one of the worst statistically in the league this season, having attempted 20 dribbles and only completing 5.
He is also one of the worst players aerially in the league if you look at his aerial duel completion stats too.

I understand football isn’t all about stats, but he has been very poor this season, our whole forward line stinks, and I’m not sure why."
8106,Newcastle,"Longstaff wasn’t over-criticised IMO, you’re a complete man down in midfield with him - can’t attack nor defend and he just loses the ball killing attack and helping their attacks - sincerely a player that shouldn’t even be near our bench let alone starting 11 Finally. Going forward - He runs into spots where opposition players already are, that doesn't create space. It's almost an attempt to avoid the ball. Going back - he runs the most to get back but again then avoids the ball. What's the fucking point He has a decent role to play when we’re expected to see a minority of the ball but against a low block he doesn’t bring enough"
8107,Newcastle,I’d take glasner if the worst comes 
8108,Newcastle,If you can't change the squad all you can change is the manager. 
8109,Newcastle,"I think we need to sell Isak for the funds, and longstaff just to free us from that trap. No point having isak atm as we can't create chances. Need a rw and dm and cb. Osula, Wilson are good enough for now and Gordon as a back up for us front. We need the cash held in isak. Agree. As good as Isak is and has been for us it is time to capitalize and let him go to adress other areas."
8110,Newcastle,"What I found most frustrating is the way we responded to go behind. I would say we played well the first 10 minutes then the first goal was poor defending and a real sucker punch.

The lack of leadership is a worry, when Eddie came in we had the “leadership group” of people like Trippier, Wilson, Burn, Ritchie, Dummett etc, and it’s incredibly noticeable when none of them are on the pitch like last night. 

We really need some of our players to step up, or start buying players who have leadership qualities."
8111,Newcastle,"Miley isn't a 10, he's a better version of Longstaff. Apparently in the England U21s he was played straight up as an attacking midfielder and did well, note he is young too, like if he has it physically and technically he would need training on the mental side of the game and positioning but the key thing is to ask the question ""if he was trained enough would he be good"" and I think the answer is yes for most places in midfield."
8112,Newcastle,"Wasn't Wilson limping at the end - love the guy but wouldn't be surprised if we don't see him make the bench again for a few weeks Haha I didn’t see but wouldn’t surprise me at all if he’s out again. Please don't say that, he actually looked good when he came on"
8113,Newcastle,"We at no point could have won that another day. 2 shots on goal. That doesn’t tell the full story, especially the first half we were the better side"

I’m not trying to be obtuse but he will have 1 OK game in 5 where he’ll run around a lot and other players will cover for him and well hear everyone try and say “I told ya so” as if he’s an important cog to our success
8129,Newcastle,Agree. As good as Isak is and has been for us it is time to capitalize and let him go to adress other areas. 
8130,Newcastle,"The lack of leadership is a worry, when Eddie came in we had the “leadership group” of people like Trippier, Wilson, Burn, Ritchie, Dummett etc, and it’s incredibly noticeable when none of them are on the pitch like last night. 

We really need some of our players to step up, or start buying players who have leadership qualities. "
8131,Newcastle,"Apparently in the England U21s he was played straight up as an attacking midfielder and did well, note he is young too, like if he has it physically and technically he would need training on the mental side of the game and positioning but the key thing is to ask the question ""if he was trained enough would he be good"" and I think the answer is yes for most places in midfield. Fingers crossed he develops them. My only real issue with Miley is that he has no real pace."
8132,Newcastle,Haha I didn’t see but wouldn’t surprise me at all if he’s out again. 
8133,Newcastle,"Please don't say that, he actually looked good when he came on "
8134,Newcastle,"That doesn’t tell the full story, especially the first half we were the better side You have to convert dominance to goals we never looked like doing that."
8135,Newcastle,We won the game after the palace game last year so here’s hoping 
8136,Newcastle,"Look, I loved the 90s too but we have to accept those days aren't coming back I agree that the roll of the dice to 442 didn’t work last night. We then defaulted to crosses etc., that were easily taken care of by WH defence. Would have been better to maintained our starting formation and try to unpick them. Ultimately it was one of those nights. Had we scored first I suspect we would have beaten them comprehensively."
8137,Newcastle,"He had several chances last night and missed them all, whether by being offside, or lashing at the opportunity. He had two chances. Every single cross was overhit or was never attempted. You had Isak coming back into the defence at times trying to pick the ball up and create something. Our problems aren't on Isak they're systemic and have been for a long, long time."
8138,Newcastle,That’s what happens when we go an extended length without first team purchases 
8139,Newcastle,"Does he though? I’m not trying to be obtuse but he will have 1 OK game in 5 where he’ll run around a lot and other players will cover for him and well hear everyone try and say “I told ya so” as if he’s an important cog to our success https://youtu.be/fjv8n_en77U?si=usHJGO1-AtaCzSXP Did we look better when he came off though? Cause if we were a man down in midfield when he was on (your words) then subbing Tonali on must have made us better in the second half, right?"
8140,Newcastle,Fingers crossed he develops them. My only real issue with Miley is that he has no real pace. 
8141,Newcastle,You have to convert dominance to goals we never looked like doing that.

8145,Newcastle,"Did we look better when he came off though? Cause if we were a man down in midfield when he was on (your words) then subbing Tonali on must have made us better in the second half, right? We looked much better against Forest and Wolves when he came on

He should’ve started, plain and simple - by the time Howe made his subs he’d completely thrown away any set up and had committed to just pumping shite crosses and long passes to Isak"
8146,Newcastle,Embarrassing isn’t it mate 
8147,Newcastle,"We looked much better against Forest and Wolves when he came on

He should’ve started, plain and simple - by the time Howe made his subs he’d completely thrown away any set up and had committed to just pumping shite crosses and long passes to Isak Ok but did we look better when Sean came off last night? First half we were good, second half we were shite. 

Point being made was that Longstaffs was over criticised last night, and your proving that point. Willock had an absolute stinker yet Longstaff gets more hate. 

On the point of Tonali I think it's a bigger issue of not getting the best out of him or Bruno when they're on the pitch together, which is a problem Howe needs to work out asap."

So probably.

But real talk, we lost the game and midfield because we decided to play 4-4-2 with no actual plan to compensate the midfield gap. Bro this gaslighting from some fans is brazy

Willock was shite as were others but they can have great games where they’re the focal reason of our win - Longstaff categorically does not have that and never has, he *constantly* drops stinkers and gets praise for a 3/10 performance and this has been the case since midway through last season, possibly longer The second half howe decided on a formation that just doesn't exist. Confused the fuck out of the players who had no idea where they were meant to be. Longstaff is stealing a living in the premiership."

Genuinely feel like I'm the one being gaslit here....

We looked solid first half, creating chances and pinning the back. Then Kelly has a mare and gifts them a goal. We get back into it but still can't break through and finish our chances, mainly due to poor attacking play and finishing from Isak, Gordon and Willock. Even Joelinton gave the ball away and conceded cheap fouls plenty. We come out in the second half and Gordon misses a sitter, Kelly does some more questionable defending and they score again. Howe takes Longstaff off chucks on some attacking players to try and salvage a result but we completely lose our shape and our press and play some of the worst football I've seen us play under Howe. 

Then I come on here and see fans laying into Longstaff saying he's the reason we lost and if we drop him all our problems will be fixed?? Howay man you gotta see the point I'm making here.

Do I think Longstaff is a great player? Nah, he's alright but not brilliant. Do I think Tonali is better? Of course I do! Do I think we've played better with Tonali or Longstaff? Well stats are showing were a much better side with Longstaff in it and Bruno and Tonali don't seem to work well together right now."
8151,Newcastle,The second half howe decided on a formation that just doesn't exist. Confused the fuck out of the players who had no idea where they were meant to be. Longstaff is stealing a living in the premiership. 
8152,Newcastle,Yes exactly - Longstaff was not the reason we lost yet for some reasons fans use any loss as a reason to have a dig 🤷🏻‍♂️ Was not the reason we lost last night.

You’re arguing with people who don’t understand how football works. Why waste your time mate"
8154,Newcastle,Was not the reason we lost last night. Thought Kelly was more to blame than Longataff. Lost Soucek in the box for the first and stood there with his arms behind his back than attempt to close Wan-Bissaka down for the second.
8155,Newcastle,You’re arguing with people who don’t understand how football works. Why waste your time mate 
8156,Newcastle,Thought Kelly was more to blame than Longataff. Lost Soucek in the box for the first and stood there with his arms behind his back than attempt to close Wan-Bissaka down for the second. 
8157,Newcastle,"Genuinely thought we would get back into it but the subs just never clicked. 


I’m also baffled at how we are so wasteful in the final 3rd. Our decision making and final ball just doesn’t allow us to be clinical. Lack of an attacking midfielder and a creative RW kill us in games where we have the ball, pressing and running doesn’t win games. Of course it helps, but not so much with the ball…its so frustrating That's got to be a coaching issue possibly we need a new forwards coach get Sir les in. Apart from tonali we don’t have depth to make game changing sub"
8158,Newcastle,"We were good in the first half, I was sure we would come back into it. Second half was worst performance under EH, what annoys me most is the subs seems to imbalance whatever we did have and we just never looked like doing anything. Eddie's idea was for Murphy to start putting crosses into the box, WH seen that after one cross and that was that.

When everything points to us having a comfortable win, it's time to worry. We has Isak and Wilson up front to be fair, so it did make sense to have someone lumping balls in.  I mean, Wilson was absolutely taken out with a stonewall penalty, and a 2-1 game with 10 minutes left would have changed the match considerably.  I don't think we need to overreact too much on this one.  But I think we all have learned a lesson not to shit on Dan Burn.  We need him at the back, and he never would have let that first goal happen.  

I think the real issue with this match was that we got sucker punched twice, and couldn't muster a response. Pretty sure Tonali at RW would be an upgrade 🤣"
8159,Newcastle,"Cup final will always be the worst. This is up there with Forest on boxing day though. Agreed. Cup final was horrible. Not just failing to win the silverware that kills me, but to not even turn up, and give such an average Man Utd side such an easy trophy win. I'm still not over it. Yeah very true. Actually having thought about it, Milan at home last season was also a terrible result. We literally just needed a point to guarantee Europa and could have made Champions knockouts with a win. We were so tame on the day urgh"
8160,Newcastle,"It was just one of those games.  If we put one of the chances away in the first half or even Gordon's chance in the second half there would have just been one winner.  Our passing was poor again though, but no need to overreact. This is the take I agree with most. Football is a game of moments and they didn't go our way.

If Isak is onside for that early goal we probably go on to smash them. They come forward for their first attack and end up scoring from the corner giving them some belief and something for them to hold on to.

Then we absolutely batter them at the start of the second half only for them to score with their first attack where AWB scores a chance he probably doesn't score 9/10 times which really killed our momentum.

It was a shit result but we played well for large spells of the game. We have had much more concerning games/performances. 

That said we cannot play 442, the players looked absolutely lost when we switched to it and we lost all control over the game. We have the same wins as we have loses, when should we be concern, are only saving grace is the league is so competitive we're only a few points out of Europe currently. Their second goal completely knocked the stuffing out of them. I think nobody in black and white believed we'd be able to get back into it. Curiously, the game felt very similar to Brighton which also came off the back of an international break."
8161,Newcastle,"Awful awful second half performance, but there was lots to be pleased about in the first half other than the horrible defending for their first goal, I thought. 

I think one of the problems is that we're so one dimensional when we attack (not in transition): overlap on the wing, back inside to Hall/Tino then a cross to the back post that no-one really attacks. We need an 8/10, or for Bruno to play in that role, cos we just look so toothless when we have sustained possession against a low block. We also need an aggressive CB and a decent RW, Gordon looks honking on the right and Murphy/Almiron aint it. Is it just NUFC though? Seems lots of teams struggle against the low block. Man City have been awful at it. Even Arsenal, who seem to have the most talent to unlock the low block, went through a recent string where they struggled mightily. It's always a tough question to answer (against good defenders)."
8162,Newcastle,"I think there were some games last season where we were really bad throughout the whole game, especially some of the away games. First half was actually alright this time. I also went to THAT Cambridge game so nah, this was bad, but far from the worst. That run of Luton (A), Forest (H) were games I expected 6 points from, but we got 0. So even results wise I don’t agree. I think the Luton A and Forest H games can be given a bit of leeway because we had about 10 players missing through injury or suspension for those, last night we were only missing Botman, Kraft and Burn from our entire squad, and only 1 of those 3 would be starting if all fit"
8163,Newcastle,"Not sure about worst result. 

Worst half performance perhaps. 

But a missed opportunity that doesn’t bode well for our season. Among the worst halves of the Howe era. It happens. And once again, Tonali and Bruno cannot be on the pitch at the same time. Stop doing that, Eddie!"
8164,Newcastle,"Sorry guys this was all my fault, I transferred in and captained Isak "
8165,Newcastle,"Losing to Liverpool 2-1 despite leading one nil and Liverpool down to ten men Aye that’s a horrific one given the circumstances, but Liverpool are still Liverpool, wasn’t expecting to win that match before it That's the first game that made me question Howe's ability to motivate the team. We just don't have a winners mindset on the team.

Regardless of the opposition, Newcastle shouldn't be throwing away a lead against 10 men."
8166,Newcastle,"He needs to learn how to use Tonali or it’s going to end up costing him his job. There’s no excuse for leaving your £60 million midfielder on the bench when you’re failing to win the midfield battle week after week. We are wasting one of the best midfielders in the world to play longstaff, it's fucjing depressing I still find it crazy we brought Tonali instead of a 6. I've been waiting to be proven wrong by the club. One defense in Howe's favour is his midfield set up requires aggressive centre backs which he doesn't have at the moment."
8167,Newcastle,"We’re very rough around the edges when tripper isn’t on the pitch imo I know what you mean, one of the big things tripps has over Tino is his dead ball/cross and calmness on the ball. Tonight we were just crossing it onto Kilmans head. Especially the second half. 

However I still think Tino is a better overall fullback and with his age. Could/should be a great player for years to come. 

Tonight was just one of those days, I hate the reactionary takes of people sometimes(but that’s football I guess). Things ofc need to be looked at and addressed (defending set pieces, finishing) but I have complete faith Eddie will do that.

Just because we lost to a very poor West Ham side (btw the majority of their fans on X still don’t know how they won that game) doesn’t mean our season is done. We lost to Luton and Forest back to back last year and finished 7th. My god some people."
8168,Newcastle,We weren’t awful first half we played decent take a few chances the Isak one and Gordon and it’s a different game. Only poor thing was wasn’t great in the second half and the passing wasn’t great no impact from any of the subs either was also disappointing. Win some you lose some onto the next game 👊 
8169,Newcastle,"It was an unfortunate game, but definitely not our worst performance I’d say, we were just unlucky. Both goals we conceded were against the run of play and galvanised West Ham. If Gordon scores or that penalty shout goes our way then it’s game on. It just wasn’t our day, but that’s football. "
8170,Newcastle,we need botman back BAD 
8171,Newcastle,"The Boys looked a bit lost and confused tonight.  5 starters away on Int’l duty left little time to work on game plan.  Tired legs were also had, as Mr Automatic ( Isak ) struggled to put balls on frame.  Disappointing, but can understand why.  This shows why PSR rules can hurt s Club like ours.  Little to no depth. 

If it continues against CP then we have a bigger problem. >left little time to work on game plan

That's just a poor excuse. It's no different to any other premiership team and  it's not like the international break came out of the blue."
8172,Newcastle,"To the bed wetting alarmists, wipe away your pre match pre cum and welcome to actual football. 

Didn’t come off for us, one of those nights. Howe can only do so much. West Ham took their slim chances in the brief moments we switched off, but we were by far the better team. 

It’s just football. It happens. No need for alarm or Howe out. Would we be better with more attacking options? Well erm… yes. But one game a crisis does not make. 

Bad result, but not a bad loss. By far the better team? I've got to disagree there. We weren't absolutely horrendous in the first half but terrible most of the second... in no universe were we 'by far' the better team, imo. We've had a lot of ""those nights"" this season, havent we, we're 10th for a reason, maybe it's best to see the overall picture rather than one single game."
8173,Newcastle,"I dont get why gordon is always starting, he has been poor all season, maybe a couple of games coming of the bench will give him some motivation "
8174,Newcastle,"meh west ham werent gonna be relegation levels of shit forever, we had chances, not that bothered about it… I dunno when the fanbase started expecting to win every game when the club literally doesn’t sign players in the transfer window

getting blown away by 4s and 5s would be when I would start thinking about worst results "
8175,Newcastle,"The worst result was that defeat at Man Utd away last season. They were shite and we let them beat us because we couldn’t take our chances. Cost us European football. That was disappointing, but Man Utd away, even when they’re poor by their own standards, is still a very tough game. We’ve only won once there in the prem era."
8176,Newcastle,WTF is this post? Is this the worst post of the Howe era? Jesus this place has turned to shit. 
8177,Newcastle,"Howe just chucked random shit onto the pitch and hoped for the best. Joelinton played about 5 different positions. Actually brought Murphy on. West Ham had a plan for us but we didn’t for them. And I think that’s a theme for all last season and this one. Nothing ever changes in our own approach, and teams are expecting everything we throw at them. That’s kinda my biggest complaint. 

Howe looked like he didn’t have a clue on how to change the game in our favour. 

Threw Wilson on and then went “shit. Gotta get a crossed in to the right hand side” It seems Howe focuses on 3/4 big games a season and for the rest he just uses plan z which is what we saw yesterday"
8178,Newcastle,The worst performance is his squad building ability 
8179,Newcastle,"'Almost fully fit squad' - do you mean apart from Botman, Burn, Krafth and Lacelles, all of which would get into the team before Kelly? So 1 position, you mean? Seems fair to say ""almost fully fit squad"" when we're talking about a single position that would change."
8180,Newcastle,"Let’s be honest, they look like shite. They were visibly tired and there were few shots on net. They were just playing in slow motion with poor passing - and they looked like they gave up well before time ran out... they can’t blame it on injuries. Just poor play and coaching. Howe needs to own it. Usually, when they play a game like this, the next game is much better. Though, that has been play bad away and come back and show up at SJP. Now they need to go show up at Selhurst Park. Gonna hear about the Guehi saga all week and game as well. Gonna be so annoying."
8181,Newcastle,It certainly was not the greatest 
8182,Newcastle,"We still have injury problems at CB. Burn was serving his suspension. 
We don't know who to start at RW now.  Gordon Joelinton or Murphy. 
I think apart from Barnes everyone is underperforming in finishing so far.  "
8183,Newcastle,"Honestly last night felt like they really didn't give a crap or have half the effort of recent matches. I can't think of anyone besides maybe Hall and Livramento who had a 'decent' game. The midfield was awful, the front 3 were pretty useless. 

Feel like that early goal just full knocked the wind out of them, knowing they have to try and break down this low block, which they can't seem to due, yet again, after going behind so early. It was a really bad goal to concede. "
8184,Newcastle,Fully fit squad? You seen our defence?  
8185,Newcastle,Yawn 
8186,Newcastle,"If Howe is staying we need to temper our expectations and realise the best we can hope for is top 8.

Nothing wrong with that if we need to build income over the next couple of years while selling players. If the ownership is trying to win things now he needs to be gone at the end of the season if he doesn’t turn it round.

We’ve had far worse results, Forest at Home, Luton etc. "
8187,Newcastle,Yes. 
8188,Newcastle,I feel.most of our games rely on us scoring first and then being able to counter when the other team pushes. If the other team sit back and defend well we always get countered on. 
8189,Newcastle,"Bruno doesn’t impact matches as much as he should. There, I said it "
8190,Newcastle,"A lot of commentators here cite the cup defeat, but that was a given. There was no way NUFC were going to win that. My expectations were rock bottom once Pope was suspended. But recent losses to Cambridge and Forest still echo in my old brain. "
8191,Newcastle,"West Ham played well, they kept the ball enough so when we got it, we never stretched them, "
8192,Newcastle,"Though Howe got the second half wrong. We finished the first well and were pushing for an equaliser. Barnes didn’t do much, and change of shape allowed West Ham to control the midfield. 

West Ham have some quality players. Bowen and Paqueta would easily get into our first team and they were both outstanding. 

Bruno, Gordon and Isak were all poor, as was Willock. In a competitive league that makes the difference. 

We’re good, but we don’t get to beat teams unless we’re on our game, and we weren’t last night. "
8193,Newcastle,"A few things. Newcastle Always pawn by Brighton. Very very bad record against Brighton.
Howe always lose to Bournemouth. His old club.  I wonder WHY.
Always lose to man utd in epl even though this is is the worst man utd in years.
Everyone else is beating man utd "
8194,Newcastle,"We don’t turn up against teams we should be comfortably beating. It seems a mentality thing.

Draw vs Man city, wins against Arsenal, in form Forest, Chelsea, and Spurs. 

But can’t beat Fulham, Brighton, Everton, West Ham. "
8195,Newcastle,"Carabao Cup final hurt the most. To play so poorly and lose to a Man Utd team who we then beat 2-0 and it could’ve been 5 or 6 a month later hurt the most.

Cambridge was the most embarrassing. They were and still are a bottom half L1 team

But this one summed up what’s wrong with us the most. It’s up there with Everton away and Forest at home from last year but we had lots of injuries then. "
8196,Newcastle,I felt that Osula should've come on for Isak in the second half. He's a handful for defenders and might free up Wilson 
8197,Newcastle,"One of the most unhinged takes I have ever heard on NUFC in recent memory. How is it unhinged? Can you name a worse result, given context of us being in excellent form and hardly any injuries last night?"
8198,Newcastle,"After the offside goal it was all downhill, we looked like we were on 0.5 speed, lost every battle for the ball. The press was none existent, had players like Wan Bissaka running 30 yards untracked. Genuinely looked like they couldn't be arsed. "
8199,Newcastle,Howe is running out of excuses quite honestly 
8200,Newcastle,"This is so reactionary. Another day we win this 3-1 or 4-1. The chances we missed first half (Gordon’s in particular), the stone wall penalty in the second half as well. At the end of the day we might not like to admit it but West Ham are probably our equal in terms of overall quality and probably a year ahead of us in terms of a project. We have better individual players but they probably have more depth and a stronger squad. That being said, Paquetta was probably the best player on the pitch last night and we didn’t seem to have too much bite in midfield once joelinton went off. I really think though if we played that game 10 times we’d win 6 or 7, draw two and lose one or two. It just happened that last night was that one or two. The defending for the second goal was poor but most of the time AWB smashes that wide or at the keeper. It’s not that bad! "
8201,Newcastle,"My god, calm down. Our fans are so dramatic.
The sooner people realise the squad we have is a top 10 and not a top 4 the more enjoyment you'll get out of watching us.

Isak - was not a great performer before coming to us.
Bruno - no one was watching him, not athletic enough.
Gordan - Everton reject. (harsh I know) 
Tonali - Arguably the best prospect we've bought, but not a game winner or a goal scorer.

The rest of our squad are either depth or have been here since before the takeover. Howe is a brilliant coach and is making most of the squad over perform. We do not belong in the top 6 yet.

Teams with better squads imo. 
Man city,
Liverpool
Arsenal
Tottenham
Chelsea
Brighton
Villa

As the season plays through we'll settle below these and Forest will start dropping more points. What is questionable is Manchester United, they will Spend  big this January and may close the gap. A top 10 squad should still perform. This was worse than anything I saw under Bruce, wtf was the second half? The team had no formation, it was even a team, just 10 individuals running around trying to find a spot for themselves."
8202,Newcastle,"It feels like we don’t have shooting practice at the minute. We work so hard get in front of goal and then make an absolute mess of it, or worse pass it back to our own half. At one point at about 70 minutes we didn’t have a shot on target! 

I think our formation needs looking at. We don’t have the players to play that system. I much prefer a 4-2-3-1 system, which is far more versatile. "
8203,Newcastle,"Not worst result, but for me it was the worst performance and reversal of form. It’s getting incredibly weary watching supposedly world class players turning in lacklustre, leggy performances every week. I think Howe is doing his best with an ageing, jaded squad and desperately needs fresh faces, but you at least expect some fight, some scrappiness, and last night it was absent. At least with Bruceball the expectations were low and you could get a season ticket! "
8204,Newcastle,"It's just looked so flat. Appreciate we've had internationals away, but what have the rest worked on there. Didn't really feel like a game plan and my days we crumbled once we conceded, particularly the second. Felt like disinterest from some. "
8205,Newcastle,"Lack of an attacking midfielder and a creative RW kill us in games where we have the ball, pressing and running doesn’t win games. Of course it helps, but not so much with the ball…its so frustrating "
8206,Newcastle,That's got to be a coaching issue possibly we need a new forwards coach get Sir les in. 
8207,Newcastle,"Apart from tonali we don’t have depth to make game changing sub I to some degree I would disagree, in a bunch of games we have been able to win because of Tonali, Barnes, maybe Willock or hall/tripps off the bench. 

But it’s a very small pool of decent players we have to call upon, and Barnes works best coming on later rather than at half time and todays subs felt off in general. But we do have a couple game changers on the bench who can be the difference against the likes of wolves or Bournemouth but lesso compared to the sky six"
8208,Newcastle,"We has Isak and Wilson up front to be fair, so it did make sense to have someone lumping balls in.  I mean, Wilson was absolutely taken out with a stonewall penalty, and a 2-1 game with 10 minutes left would have changed the match considerably.  I don't think we need to overreact too much on this one.  But I think we all have learned a lesson not to shit on Dan Burn.  We need him at the back, and he never would have let that first goal happen.  

I think the real issue with this match was that we got sucker punched twice, and couldn't muster a response. Sorry but it really wasn't a pen. Both players came together with strength."
8209,Newcastle,Pretty sure Tonali at RW would be an upgrade 🤣 
8210,Newcastle,"Agreed. Cup final was horrible. Not just failing to win the silverware that kills me, but to not even turn up, and give such an average Man Utd side such an easy trophy win. I'm still not over it. Still not over 98 and 99, so won't be getting over the latest one any time soon. Felt more like watching a fever dream than a game of football."
8211,Newcastle,"Yeah very true. Actually having thought about it, Milan at home last season was also a terrible result. We literally just needed a point to guarantee Europa and could have made Champions knockouts with a win. "
8212,Newcastle,We were so tame on the day urgh 
8213,Newcastle,"This is the take I agree with most. Football is a game of moments and they didn't go our way.

If Isak is onside for that early goal we probably go on to smash them. They come forward for their first attack and end up scoring from the corner giving them some belief and something for them to hold on to.

Then we absolutely batter them at the start of the second half only for them to score with their first attack where AWB scores a chance he probably doesn't score 9/10 times which really killed our momentum.

It was a shit result but we played well for large spells of the game. We have had much more concerning games/performances. 

That said we cannot play 442, the players looked absolutely lost when we switched to it and we lost all control over the game. Aye for sure we’ve had worse games/peformances, even this season it’s not the worst performance. 

But in terms of losing at home to a side that will most likely finish bottom 10, when we have almost full squad and in great form I think the context makes this a worse result Correct. It was poor after 0-2 but I think everyone was just stunned after that second goal went in, took the wind right out of everyone's sails. And then they got a bit desperate, throwing the ball forward, which played right into West Ham's hands. Until that point they had pressed well, Gordon and Isak missed fantastic chances, on another day could have easily scored 2 in that first half.

What was utterly inexcusable was the defending for the first goal. If there was ever any doubt, Lloyd Kelly is not up to the job. How is Soucek left completely unchallenged, one of the most prolific set piece scorers in the league? That more or less cost them the game. They desperately need Botman back fit, and another new centre half alongside him."
8214,Newcastle,"We have the same wins as we have loses, when should we be concern, are only saving grace is the league is so competitive we're only a few points out of Europe currently. "
8215,Newcastle,"Their second goal completely knocked the stuffing out of them. I think nobody in black and white believed we'd be able to get back into it. Curiously, the game felt very similar to Brighton which also came off the back of an international break. "
8216,Newcastle,"Is it just NUFC though? Seems lots of teams struggle against the low block. Man City have been awful at it. Even Arsenal, who seem to have the most talent to unlock the low block, went through a recent string where they struggled mightily. It's always a tough question to answer (against good defenders). "
8217,Newcastle,"I think the Luton A and Forest H games can be given a bit of leeway because we had about 10 players missing through injury or suspension for those, last night we were only missing Botman, Kraft and Burn from our entire squad, and only 1 of those 3 would be starting if all fit "
8218,Newcastle,"Among the worst halves of the Howe era. It happens. And once again, Tonali and Bruno cannot be on the pitch at the same time. Stop doing that, Eddie! I dont think that half was a fair indication of Tonali and Bruno together. Howe destroyed the team shape for most of the time they were in the pitch."
8219,Newcastle,"Aye that’s a horrific one given the circumstances, but Liverpool are still Liverpool, wasn’t expecting to win that match before it "
8220,Newcastle,"That's the first game that made me question Howe's ability to motivate the team. We just don't have a winners mindset on the team.

Regardless of the opposition, Newcastle shouldn't be throwing away a lead against 10 men. "
8221,Newcastle,"We are wasting one of the best midfielders in the world to play longstaff, it's fucjing depressing It’s maddening, Tonali would start for most teams in the league, Longstaff would be lucky to start for any."
8222,Newcastle,"I still find it crazy we brought Tonali instead of a 6. I've been waiting to be proven wrong by the club. One defense in Howe's favour is his midfield set up requires aggressive centre backs which he doesn't have at the moment. I honestly think the plan was to bed him in for a year then sell Bruno, but the ban scuppered all of that and left the plan in an odd limbo Thats not a defence for Howe, if we haven’t got the players to play a certain system, we should be changing and adapting our tactics to suit the players we have."
8223,Newcastle,"I know what you mean, one of the big things tripps has over Tino is his dead ball/cross and calmness on the ball. Tonight we were just crossing it onto Kilmans head. Especially the second half. 

However I still think Tino is a better overall fullback and with his age. Could/should be a great player for years to come. 

Tonight was just one of those days, I hate the reactionary takes of people sometimes(but that’s football I guess). Things ofc need to be looked at and addressed (defending set pieces, finishing) but I have complete faith Eddie will do that.

Just because we lost to a very poor West Ham side (btw the majority of their fans on X still don’t know how they won that game) doesn’t mean our season is done. We lost to Luton and Forest back to back last year and finished 7th. My god some people. Tino and Hall are brilliant and can be the future, but they’re naivety (is that a word) seemed to be exposed a bit today, the same with Kelly."
8224,Newcastle,">left little time to work on game plan

That's just a poor excuse. It's no different to any other premiership team and  it's not like the international break came out of the blue. "
8225,Newcastle,"By far the better team? I've got to disagree there. We weren't absolutely horrendous in the first half but terrible most of the second... in no universe were we 'by far' the better team, imo. Fair enough. Just think this Jan we really need another attacking creative outlet, Willock going off and our downturn was no coincidence. We are massively reliant on him as our periods of form over the years attest"
8226,Newcastle,"We've had a lot of ""those nights"" this season, havent we, we're 10th for a reason, maybe it's best to see the overall picture rather than one single game. Considering the competitive nature of the league, and the fact we are 4 points off 3rd, I wouldn’t read too much into it"
8227,Newcastle,"That was disappointing, but Man Utd away, even when they’re poor by their own standards, is still a very tough game. We’ve only won once there in the prem era. "
8228,Newcastle,"That’s kinda my biggest complaint. 

Howe looked like he didn’t have a clue on how to change the game in our favour. 

Threw Wilson on and then went “shit. Gotta get a crossed in to the right hand side” https://i.imgur.com/NeJCr4V.jpeg

This is from his time at Bournemouth.

https://i.imgur.com/HAz1hRl.jpeg

I thought his hiatus might have changed him, but it seems to be almost a carbon copy playing out."
8229,Newcastle,It seems Howe focuses on 3/4 big games a season and for the rest he just uses plan z which is what we saw yesterday 
8230,Newcastle,"So 1 position, you mean? Seems fair to say ""almost fully fit squad"" when we're talking about a single position that would change. "
8231,Newcastle,"Usually, when they play a game like this, the next game is much better. Though, that has been play bad away and come back and show up at SJP. Now they need to go show up at Selhurst Park. Gonna hear about the Guehi saga all week and game as well. Gonna be so annoying. "
8232,Newcastle,"How is it unhinged? Can you name a worse result, given context of us being in excellent form and hardly any injuries last night? "
8233,Newcastle,"A top 10 squad should still perform. This was worse than anything I saw under Bruce, wtf was the second half? The team had no formation, it was even a team, just 10 individuals running around trying to find a spot for themselves. We were very strong until we went 2 down, we then threw the kitchen sink at it and looked a mess because of it. Who can blame that decision at 2 down?
If we performed every week, we'd be winning the league Worse than Bruce? Lol..."
8234,Newcastle,"I to some degree I would disagree, in a bunch of games we have been able to win because of Tonali, Barnes, maybe Willock or hall/tripps off the bench. 

But it’s a very small pool of decent players we have to call upon, and Barnes works best coming on later rather than at half time and todays subs felt off in general. But we do have a couple game changers on the bench who can be the difference against the likes of wolves or Bournemouth but lesso compared to the sky six "
8235,Newcastle,"Sorry but it really wasn't a pen. Both players came together with strength. Climbing on someones back and wrapping your arms around their neck is not ""coming together with strength"" it is ""impeding the attacker"" which is a penalty. Wilson was jumping to head it in when the West Ham lad bear hugged him from behind.

Should have been a pen but with VAR seemingly changing the parameters every week I wasn't surprised they didn't review it. 

Pawson should have given it on the field but in fairness to him he'd let a lot go up until that moment so wasn't out of character."
8236,Newcastle,"Still not over 98 and 99, so won't be getting over the latest one any time soon. Felt more like watching a fever dream than a game of football. At least in 98 we gave it a go against a vastly superior team and did our best. Hit the post twice. Arsenal were such a good team. Those times were just being beaten by the better side. 2023 was bending over."
8237,Newcastle,"Aye for sure we’ve had worse games/peformances, even this season it’s not the worst performance. 

But in terms of losing at home to a side that will most likely finish bottom 10, when we have almost full squad and in great form I think the context makes this a worse result "

Howe was guilty of this when Pope was injured and he persisted with the high line, but I think it's different this season."
8243,Newcastle,"Tino and Hall are brilliant and can be the future, but they’re naivety (is that a word) seemed to be exposed a bit today, the same with Kelly. not sure i would call kelly naive, it was just poor Yeah it can happen. 

Especially with the age of Hall and Tino. 

I know people (including me) like to dig out Burn a lot, but my word we missed him today. Nevermind Botman.

Oh well, I still think we are well on the up (overall). I still think 5th,6th,7th is a big probability. Some people forget we are 90’ away also from a cup semi final."

8257,Newcastle,"Comes on at 85’

HWTL

(Then misses Palace and Liverpool, back for Brentford) This aged well"
8258,Newcastle,"Comes on in the 60th minute, scores a hatty and leaves the pitch to the adoration of the crowd.

During his post match interview with sky sports he cracks that massive grin and dislocates his jaw. 

Out for the rest of the season "
8259,Newcastle,"3rd minute.
He spontaneously combusts on the bench. 

The explosive blast causes a head injury to Schär who goes on to have the game of his life, scoring a hat trick. 
All of the goals coming from 80 yards including one header. Have a little realism, please.

There's *no way* Wilson lasts three minutes."

8268,Newcastle,Hope he doesn’t. 
8269,Newcastle,"Crowd goes quiet as he is subbed on. TV punters: ""The Toon Army are showing their frustration with Wilson by not cheering his return."" 

The reality at SJP: Half of us are quietly offering a prayer to St. Sylvain, the patron saint of 'delicate players who can be mortally wounded by a gust of wind', to give us the lad for at least a month, while the other half are mumbling ""which one is he again?"" "
8270,Newcastle,Wilson & Isak brace each the neet!

I think he'll play 23 minutes before an injury, strain or knock. "

8297,Newcastle,I’m doing my part 🫡 
8298,Newcastle,Let's get smashed by these we're shite  I’m smashed. We’re shite.
8299,Newcastle,"Second half was the worst this season (and there's been some shite).

We looked amazing first 10 mins and start of second half. Conceded twice and shit the bed.

The 4-4-2 didn't work at all. Anyone thinking Isak and Wilson in the same team are delusional Seemed like we settled for a 4-2-3-1 with Isak wide left and Barnes in a CAM role. But it seemed like the more tweaks just confused the players"
8300,Newcastle,"Slog of a work day, settled down to watch that and kick the week off. Fucking waste of time, questions need answering after that performance. Aye, so many people make excuses for this team. Injuries, too many games, fitness, whatever.

At the end of the day something needs to seriously change.

We've been like this for far too long. There's no consistency, some games we just don't turn up and look absolutely shambolic. They tried a new formation, it didn’t work, we’re still very much in range of Europe."
8301,Newcastle," St. James' Park. Under the lights. Monday night.


I was so confident. What a let down If there's one thing I've learned from following the toon for over 40 years it's that the instant you expect a result, or go into a game with any degree of confidence, you'd better fucking believe that the club will find a way to utterly fuck it up and ruin your day."
8302,Newcastle,"What do we do with Tonali? The man is quality for Italy, but Howe doesn't seem to know what to do with him to recreate that form. The most alarming thing about the Tonali thing is that Howe insisted he was his top target. Yet he’s been at the club nearly 18 months and still looks as though he’s never met his teammates. And still can’t get into the team over Sean Longstaff. Top target but you don’t even know how to use him? Yikes

At this point, I just don’t think Howe can change this midfield. This is how he sets up. I’m not expecting him to suddenly revolutionise the system after 3 years of the same stuff. Turn him into an old school Beckenbauer sweeper, give Bruno permission to attack. He needs to fucking play him from the kick off for starters We need a dm so tonali can play as an 8 and Bruno as a ten This says alot about Howe, so many options to make it work Fucking play him instead of benching him for Sean Longstaff"
8303,Newcastle,"That was the first time in a long long time I’ve been excited to watch us play. Did not see that coming at all and absolutely gutted We have to stop underestimating other teams, especially when west ham finished only 2 spots below us last season. It was always going to be a tough game and not the guarantee win everyone was saying"
8304,Newcastle,"Thanks lads, that was horrible. 

See you at the weekend. "
8305,Newcastle,Ugh. So annoying. Must do better at Palace on the weekend Annual 0-0 is guaranteed. Palace is better than west ham
8306,Newcastle,"A team that crumbles when they have a chance to go 6th deserves jack shit Chance to be two points off 2nd and we deliver that performance… 

Do I want Howe gone? No. But does he know his best team? No. Longstaff and Joelinton have their merits but simply don’t work against a low block, which is exactly what West Ham did for 60 minutes until it was too late and we were 2-0 down. Feels like we’re trying outdo Spurs for winning the games we probably shouldn’t and losing the games we should probably win. I like Howe, I love what he’s done for the club, but if we miss out on top 6 again there will be undoubted questions asked about the direction we’re going in

We need to find more consistency otherwise I can see us missing top 6 with the competition the way it is this year. So frustrating after three huge performances, a bit like being back at square 1 now"
8307,Newcastle,"Honestly struggling to think of a worse performance in recent memory. 

Think we put in better shifts last year when we were down to the bare bones. That was rotten football.

Said in the Match Thread wins over Arsenal and Forest mean nothing when you're dropping points against West Ham, Fulham and Brighton. "
8308,Newcastle,Hall and Livramento played well. Yeah the young full backs and Joelinton felt like the only players that wanted to work for the team. Not sure Tino did. His crossing is garbage. Rarely beats the first man
8309,Newcastle,"The reality is that we’re a classic mid-table team, capable of excellent performances one week and really poor displays the next. There will be criticism of Eddie but the biggest questions are for ownership. PIF, the Reubens and/or Darren Eales who oversaw a crucial summer window where with the exception of Kelly (neither Vlachodimos or Osula seem like genuine options), we didn’t add a single player to the squad. 

Even on nights like tonight, I enjoy watching Newcastle far more than at any stage since Sir Bobby’s time in charge. However Yasir Al-Rumayyan wasn’t shy in saying that the ambition is “to be number one.” When you look at the summer window, the lack of development on a new training ground, fewer than expected sponsorship deals and the delays on making a decision regarding SJP, I don’t think it’s totally unfair to quote Kevin Keegan. 

“It's not like it said in the brochure” I said this is the summer. Questions need to be asked how we got in a position that we needed to sell 2 of our best prospects to comply with PSR. Our transfer business over the last 3 windows has been abit shocking. 3 bad transfer windows in a row - its true. But if Howe refused to let Almiron go (his agent saying this), refused to sign RW and focused on Guehi... its on him, at least 50% if not more. Our awful record on defensive & attacking set-pieces is also on him. This is a great post. I think come April / May, this will still be utterly true. I don’t think it will
Be true for Howe at that point any longer unfortunately. Mental world of football. He is gonna be under pressure this season unlike any other. Howe started a power struggle in the summer to maintain control over transfers. Ashworth wanted more control then he got and apparently felt he didn't have enough of a say compared to Howe. 

The ownership have brought in a new DoF. Twice. Howe has started and won a power struggle against them. Twice. 

If there is a question to be asked of the ownership over recruitment... It's a question of whether they need to put Howe in his place (or put someone else in it) but when it comes to recruitment, the questions are for Howe as much as anybody. The players on the pitch (apart from Kelly) were more than good enough to win the game easily. That means it's on the manager. I think alot of pardews games were much better than last night. Howe is out of his depth. Said this in August and got downvoted to shit, but it’s the reality. Howe isn’t the problem, if anything he’s a victim of his own success the last two seasons. 

Apart from 3-4 star players (Bruno, Isak, maybe Tonali and Gordon? Not even sure tbh) this is a team of mid table PL players. That’s not to say they’re terrible all the time but they’re not consistently good enough to establish this club in the top 6. 

It would have sucked at the time but I think the smarter approach this summer would have been to sell off a star name like Gordon and bring in a couple of solid players with the money we made. Our lack of depth is genuinely laughable. Jacob Murphy is our best winger off the bench? That is a stark reminder of how limited this squad truly is. 

Howe has worked absolute miracles the past two seasons but the magic is gonna run out eventually. I think the ceiling for this season is 6th, the floor could be a lot lower than we realize. Tbf the chairman said that before the rules were completely changed specifically to block us from progressing.

We have no way of progressing without a new stadium. I don't want to move but thems the facts."
8310,Newcastle,"Swear we always drop in form after every international break

Still no excuses for the team, we were as clinical as Gary Neville making a good point (he barely does) Agree with neville, I thought be became the best pundit around 10 years ago


Now he just seems to ramble for the sake of it"
8311,Newcastle,If theres one thing ive learned in my 33 years supporting Newcastle its that they will let you down just when you think the tide is turning 
8312,Newcastle,Right one of your fuckers said something about losing 2-0. It's your fault 
8313,Newcastle,"Fair play to West Ham, but we looked absolutely cursed when it came to finishing chances "
8314,Newcastle,"We look proper mid table this season and that's very worrying cause it'll have real consequences. We've got a mid table squad. And if our ""star"" players don't perform then we're fucked"
8315,Newcastle,"I think the ""stick with the winning team"" idea should be done now. Time to start figuring out why Tonali, Bruno and Willock don't work and fix that issue. 

God we need a good RW ASAP. I thought big Joe did a ok job out there howe was just grasping at straws with his substitutions. Barnes has worked in the past so it's his only thought. Would have been better bringing on tonali and Barnes and leaving big Joe out on the right. I can tell you why Bruno, Tonali and Willock don't work as a 3, they are all too inclinded to go forward which leaves us vunerable to the counter attack, that is why Longstaff plays, he gives us a better balance in midfield as he reads the game well and is willing to drop deep and defend."
8316,Newcastle,"[deleted] We were shite Definitely a penalty... But not the reason they lost. Let’s be honest, they look like shite. They were visibly tired and there were few shots on net. They were just playing in slow motion with poor passing - and they looked like they gave up well before time ran out... they can’t blame it on injuries. Just poor play (and coaching). Esp. when Dummett got pen against Everton last season for same thing

fucking chris kavanagh, cunt I mean Wilson was asking for it"
8317,Newcastle,"Next time we face a low block team why don’t we try lining up everyone in the 18 yard line and pass it about till we cut one in to absolutely nobody. 

Usually works for us. Oh and don’t cross the ball until their defence is set so take extra touches if possible Give it Tino to blast at the first man along the floor. Or Longstaff to miscontrol or misplaced a pass. Or Bruno to fail at something audacious. Or Joelinton to draw a few men in, pass it off and then the recipient do nothing dynamic with it. Oh no it's ok, Schar's arrived. He's seen nothing is happening so he's going to twat it. Oh no they saw that might happen 5 passes ago so they're set up to defend it.."
8318,Newcastle,"Bad at the back, bad at the front, no creativity in midfield, bad management with the changes and subs made, that about sums up what I watched. We could have played for a week and not scored a goal today, we would probably have just conceded a few.

Also seriously what is up with our fans? When last did we see St James Park empty before full time? It’s not really hard to get out of the ground like Wembley or Brighton, so what’s the excuse, especially when it’s so damn hard to get a ticket. "
8319,Newcastle,"On the way back home from SJP and I’d go I’d say that’s out worst performance under Howe.

Nothing went our way and we were robbed of a stonewall penalty but we deserved nothing let’s be fair.

Joelinton was the best IMO purely through his workrate but even his passing was awful 

Willock had an absolute mare, he couldn’t make simple passes, it was like he had the wrong boots on.

Longstaff was a total passenger as he often is, I wonder if the Geordie lad from 4-4-2 will make a video praising how often he meanders into the way of our attacks after praising his amazing movement?

The back 4 was all over the shop, Burn can be a bit of a plank at times but we missed his leadership. I’m sure their first doesn’t happen with him on the pitch. Kelly failed his audition, Schar was frustrating, Hall the worst he’s looked in weeks and Tino offered nothing going forward.

Bruno grafted like crazy as did Gordon but both had really poor games. Tonali didn’t change much, the lazy side of Barnes was apparent and Isak was just off.

Total burn the tape game The one thing I noticed about longstaffs movement, he always runs into a spot where opposition players are. So no one has to track him, it doesn't open up any space, almost like he's hiding from the ball"
8320,Newcastle,Us bedwetters are back baby 
8321,Newcastle,"The fact that Howe isn’t daring enough to play our 60m midfielder over Sean Longstaff at home to a poor team is astounding. I don’t know how many times I can see the same ‘start the wrong team, start losing and bring the right players on after we’re behind’ shit.

And then the fact that he had a whole half to see it wasn’t working but chose to bring on Barnes instead, which meant our best performer of the half in Joelinton had to move to CM. Suddenly your CMs are back to being Longstaff and Joelinton, just like it was at the start of the season when it wasn’t working and couldn’t break down a deep defence. And then when we go 2-0 down, he brings on Tonali. Apparently he couldn’t do it at half time but 10 mins after the break is cool when the battle has already been lost.

These are the types of results and decisions I think of when people ask why Howe gets stick. It’s all good when things are going well but I can name multiple occasions this season alone where Howe has failed to react to the warning signs and only made the big decisions after we’re losing. If we need the fear of a loss to actually make a bold move then it’s not going to end well. If you’re too scared to drop your favourites and still don’t know your best team or how to get the best out of £100m+ of talent nearly half way into the season then it won’t end well.

Over the past month I’ve said the praise for Howe needed to be as loud as the disrespect, considering the improvement in form. But, in that same thought, the criticism should not be ignored. We lost because we approached this game with arrogance and thought playing the same team from 2 weeks ago was enough. Very poor game from Howe and a lot of the players. Inexcusable at home. Absobloodylutely.
Someone needs to press a button somewhere now. Name a suite after Howe for what he's done for the club, which is truly remarkable. 
But you've got to look forwards not backwards and he has run out of ideas. He's taken us as far as he can. We need a clever tactician now."
8322,Newcastle,as woeful as we were going forward my one overriding feeling is that we need sven botman back asap. 
8323,Newcastle,"I love Howe as a person but he’s at his best when he made a mediocre team look class and I fear he’s making a class team look mediocre. 

A team with Tonali, Isak, Hall, Tino, Bruno, Joelinton has to be able to produce more than what we just saw I'm no tactical expert at all but he can't seem to get the best balance out of those players. Play Joelinton, Bruno and Tonali and we get cut apart when going defensive, as an example. 

It does not help that our defence is non existent now. I disagree. Howe has at least 50% of blame, sure.                   

But our squad isnt class one. We literally the only PL team who didnt improved in last 1.5 years.                               

> Tonali, Isak, Hall, Tino, Bruno, Joelinton                                        

All of them are suffering, because they have non-PL quality partners... And Howe refusing to let them go or sell them (like I can understand wanting to save Tripps, but Almiron??). A midfielder of tonali, Bruno, and joelinton won’t work. We need a new dm and tonali play the 8 role and Bruno play the 10"
8324,Newcastle,"Newcastle and the low block, a tale as old as time. "
8325,Newcastle,"Longstaff is a wasted shirt, Kelly was a poor signing and when Botman comes back he’s 3rd choice at LCB. Schar was poor, Gordon was awful and doesn’t look arsed tbh. Just utterly shite. "
8326,Newcastle,"Trying to summarise what’s missing and probably its leadership 

On pitch and off. "
8327,Newcastle,"How do we freshen things up without sacking Howe and launching half the squad into the sun? Honestly. Go back to the basics and play your best players in the best positions. 

Ok. Our RW options are lacking. I don’t care. Gordon plays LW and Barnes challenges him. Miggy and Murphy challenge for RW. 

I thought the point of this squad build was to be able to stick to a stable system and change the personnel when we aren’t getting what we need or the legs run out. We sack Howe and launch them."
8328,Newcastle,Issue is losing on Monday ruins the entire fucking week.  
8329,Newcastle,No depth. How can a team that is supposed to challenge for Europe have Murphy coming on as a substitute. Even west ham’s substitutes  had more quality 
8330,Newcastle,"Well at least people can no longer use that when longstaff starts we win bollocks, so that's a silver lining. Gutted low block, howe has been found out also gutted about that come on Eddie sort it out. "
8331,Newcastle,Lloyd Kelly on a free and we still got skanked 
8332,Newcastle,"Reverting to form. The plan to beat Eddie Howe’s Newcastle is simple. Either:  
Be Liverpool  
or  
Sit deep, hit on the counter

Why is it always so easy Give it to them and let them play themselves into the wide areas. Flood your box and you got nothing to worry about. 

Most up and coming managers worth their salt are focussing on developing methods to suck space out of opposition."
8333,Newcastle,"Disappointed by Howes interview. Was hoping he'd take more responsibility. Almost blamed the players for heads dropping after the 2nd goal, rather than his shift to 4-4-2. "
8334,Newcastle,"3 months into the season and we are 10th. We've got massive unresolved issues with the system. We've dropped points against Bournemouth, West Ham, Everton, Fulham and Brighton. 1 win in the last 4 home games. 

We can't break down low blocks. Teams walk through our midfield. We aren't creating or scoring goals. 

I'm backing Eddie Howe as much as I can because I want it to work. But If I'm being honest with myself, more and more questions are getting asked as the season goes on, and I'm not sure I believe he has the answers. I went into half time hopeful of a Howe masterclass in the 2nd half and it couldn't have been further from the truth. It was probably the most he's flapped in 3 years that 2nd half. 5 goals in 6 home PL games. 1 win in the last 4 home games? Do you mean PL games only?"
8335,Newcastle,"Sent this to a mate earlier… 

Almiron, Murphy, Schar, Wilson, Longstaff, Joelinton, Kraft, Willock, Dubravka, Lascelles are all pre takeover players, some of which were in the Championship and they’re a big part of our first team. We’re fucking shit. Villa’s squad by comparison is completely different to that three years ago, but they only managed it by selling Grealish for £100 million. If we are to go anywhere, we have to sell players who were bought post takeover, Bruno and Isak for a combined £130 million, meaning we’ll then have to replace the calibre of them, which will put us back in financial trouble in three years time. How the fuck does that work?

Anyone want to cheer me up. Matches like tonight really fuck me off… Bruno and isak combined will go for more than 130 mil. At least 150 mil. But should be as close to 200 mil as possible Villa also had emery who is able to attract quality signings. We have Howe who wants to stick with the English lads We would be better off selling longstaff for 20 million 130 million is only 20 million net profit on our best two players."
8336,Newcastle,"Lewis Hall has been the only composed player for us, we have played way too fast when not needed and way too slow when we’ve needed to. This is sometimes the problem when “intensity is our identity” is that we forget that you don’t have to be intense on the ball.

All we do is get the ball wide and go back to play the ball out wide again, never have any creativity in the half spaces to link play around the box, makes it easy to defend against. Hall was ok but he got done a number of times. Tino was better defensively but he's not great going forward or crossing. Nobody played well. Kelly was probably the worst, closely followed by Gordon, Isak and Willock. Under/over hit passes, poor finishing, poor movement, deserved to lose. 


We go all mad for the first 10 minutes each half hoping to smash them, then lose all semblance of a plan, and our really good players play very poorly indeed. 


This season we have looked wrong, Arsenal game aside. There's something broken at the club, and there's probably numerous reasons why they is. I don't like to be knee jerk pessimistic right after a loss, but I think we'll finish mid table and lose Isak and Bruno and have to start another rebuild, because we haven't clicked so far and the owners and players are going to lose patience.


NO shots on target second half. At home. Against a dreadful West Ham (who played well). That's really terrible."
8337,Newcastle,"If dan burn plays they dont get that first goal Kelly is so damn bad, IDK who recommended him He throws himself in front of the second too"
8338,Newcastle,"Losing at home is one thing. Seeing the away team follow a basic blueprint to beat us is another. Howe's zero plan B strikes again. What did you want for plan B?

How about a half time sub for Barnes, maybe bringing on Wilson and going 442 for the last half an hour?"
8339,Newcastle,"We were absolute tripe. Wrong team selected, every change made us worse. No inspiration. Not sure what’s going to happen in the short term but at some point Howe will get his jotters… "
8340,Newcastle,"I love Eddie, but far too often we face a low block and become Toothless Crosses FC. If a team wants to close a game out against us, they easily can Don't forget  Blast 11 Shot Attempts Into Opposition Legs FC."
8341,Newcastle,Wilson and Isak injured? It’s ur time osula 
8342,Newcastle,We've been aware of the need for a RW since the takeover 
8343,Newcastle,"We really struggle to break down teams that play with 10 behind the ball. And then when we went 442 and tried to force it they were still too well organised for it. Kelly was poor on both goals, he did make one cracking tackle tho. Ref had a lot of non decisions and can't understand why we didn't get a pen. Really missed BDB and the usual issue with RW Kelly made 2 cracking tackles, he just got a yellow for one of them because Pawson needs an eye test."
8344,Newcastle,Howe got done tactically! 
8345,Newcastle,"Fucking typical. 

We were good first half but a bit sloppy with the ball. 

Collapsed second half. Second goal killed us. Fell apart after it. 

Eddie completely fucked the game up tactically second half. 

When your team is looking dominant but sloppy on the ball. You address the sloppy players. Willock had faded after his “injury” and we had Tonali on the bench. 

Joelinton was sloppy too. Clumsy in the ball and losing it as much as he was winning it. 

Gordon was completely ineffective on the right. And Barnes left. West Ham wanted to push us to the wings and Barnes couldn’t do anything with the ball when they pushed him outside. 

442 was a disaster suddenly we were overrun. Before we switched we were done by 2 counters. After West Ham were peppering our goal. That’s why they finished with more shots on target. I just don’t think you can play a 2 man midfield without a back 3 in the modern game in most games. 

If we’d started with Tonali and maybe brought on Murphy to play RW at half time I reckon we win. Regardless of technical ability of the players. You address the in game form. 

That defeat disappoints me more than the earlier ones. Worst of all. We weren’t undone as we’d expect. By a low block and lack of creativity. West Ham were playing higher up the pitch and we failed to take advantage. "
8346,Newcastle,"I think this game, and the season as a whole, shows a lack of consistent quality throughout the squad. Players like Willock, Joelinton, Schar, Burn etc, can have brilliant individual games where they look like they’re top 4 quality. But the fact is they do not play at that level consistently enough. 

It’s why we seem to win/draw games we should probably lose (Man City, Arsenal) and then lose/draw games we should probably win (Everton, West Ham) more than I see other teams doing, with the most similar team probably being Spurs. 

Do I think Howe is still getting the best out of the players he’s got? I’m not sure, but what I do know is if we want to consistently be battling for Europe there are still big improvements needed throughout the squad. To add to the inconsistency, I'm not sure Howe can motivate players for big games (and this was a big game)"
8347,Newcastle,It's been three years and we cannot break down a low block if our lives depended on it. Entirely one dimensional with no plan B. That final 20 minutes was some of the worst football I've ever seen. There has to be major changes on Saturday as we never perform at Selhurst. 
8348,Newcastle,"13 goals in 12 games is fucking bad like.

Honestly it might be worth considering a change soon, we’ve lost our way and dropped off over the past year. 

Might be an unpopular opinion but you don’t see other top clubs holding onto managers when stuck mid table. Let’s be real we’re aiming for the top.

I think Howe has potential to win a trophy for us but not the league and I can’t see us getting to Europe currently.

If we lose isak as well, we’re gonna be taking 2 steps back, we need to be in Europe to keep the top players to compete.

New ideas are needed Isak isn't exactly shining imo. Maybe Howe isn't the right manager for him?"
8349,Newcastle,shite 
8350,Newcastle,"Last season we regularly looked like pumping 3 or 4 past teams. This season we couldn't bundle it in from 2 yards.

If only we had a period over the summer where we could improve our squad. Age and and injuries have caught up with our defenders and the GK situation at the club is a laughable"
8351,Newcastle,I still can’t believe we’re paying Kelly £150k a week! £10k behind Bruno 😳 Is that true?
8352,Newcastle,"Nothing positive to say about that. Unacceptable performance.

I don't want to hear another word about the bAlAnCe Longstaff brings to this team when him and Hall are both standing off Bowen for their second. It's the midfielder's job to close the ball carrier.

Need to change the system immediately because churning out these displays repeatedly while a £60m and £40m signings sit on the bench is insanity. They closed him down, that is what they were supposed to do.

Joelinton and Kelly were the players to blame for that second goal, they could both see AWB yet neither even tried to close him down. Longstaff is at best a squad player. Probably not even that for a top 6 team."
8353,Newcastle,"Going to get my rant out the way whilst it's raw before coming back with a more balanced take in the next day thread:

What the hell is the point of Lloyd Kelly? Left huge gaps in our defence and probably at fault for both goals. 

I'm not a huge fan of the Longstaff pile on but he offered nothing today and made us worse.

Gordon doesn't seem to care and is such a different player for England than he is for us. You'd think his goal for England would have spurred him on but he looked disinterested today.

The 4-4-2 killed us. Have we even trained it? The players had no idea what was going on and who was playing where. Weird decision. 

A game we really should be winning and we've totally ballsed it up. "
8354,Newcastle,That jolly in Saudi certainly did the trick. 
8355,Newcastle,"Also far from a Longstaff-out guy. But it’s an absolute fucking insult to football as a whole that Tonali cannot get a chance. Agree


What's worse is he was Eddie's first choice.
If he was given a player he didn't want then ok, but spending $50mil on your top target and then can't figure out how to get him in the team....."
8356,Newcastle,"I'm emotional now, but I think I mean what I'm typing.

Tonight is the night I have accepted that it is time for change. It's not just the manner of the result, we were unlucky tonight in that we went 1-0 down against the run of play, then 2-0 down against the run of play. It's the impact of the strategic mismanagement of the club, and a lot of that is on Howe.
We still don't have a RW. We had two of our most expensive signings-Barnes and Tonali, on the bench. They can't get in the team whereas we are desperate for a CB, CM, CF and a RW which we can't afford!
How can we spend all that money on players who can't get a game, have Sean Longstaff starting, but have spent our budget without someone having made some huge, repeated errors?
The only answer is someone has repeatedly ballsed uo. It's Howe. And he knows it because despite buying those players, he won't pick them?

How, moving forward, with really strained transfer budgets where every signing has to deliver, can we trust Eddie to get the right players? 

He can't. It's done. We need someone who can turn water (this squad) into wine. "
8357,Newcastle,We've done nothing and we're all out of ideas 
8358,Newcastle,We're so all over the place this season. Some of our best performances and some of our worst. I don't get it. 
8359,Newcastle,Its like having a fucking Sports car with £3 in the tank coasting to the fucking garage. 
8360,Newcastle,"My dog has just went to get up from the couch when my missus shouted her for a treat, realised she couldn't be arsed, and lay back down. 

I dunno a clever way to say it but basically summed up what I've just watched. "
8361,Newcastle, It’s always when you start believing…. Did u actually think we were guaranteed to beat west ham? It was always a real possibility we were gonna lose
8362,Newcastle,"Really disappointing that so many players did well for their countries during international break, then come back to NUFC and the whole team looks so disjointed.

Anyway fuck it "
8363,Newcastle,"Gutless and heartless all round. Deserved nothing and got less.

Our inability to beat a low block is not exactly a league wide secret. Doing nothing about it for years is not a good look.

Onto the next one. We weren’t beaten by the low block though. They gave us ample space to attack. 

We were beaten because our players decisions making was woeful and our passing was woeful when it mattered. Every long ball was hit short."
8364,Newcastle,"In the first 10 minutes West Ham looked terrible. And both their goal scorers looked a bit confused after scoring. I genuinely don’t think they had a plan.

But we made them look great, so… "
8365,Newcastle,"Other than a few glimpses here and there Gordon has been utter shite this season which is costing the team massively as a goal threat


Kelly isn't even a championship player


Tonali needs to fucking start, end of, I don't care what the stats say when willock or longstaff are in the team. He's a much better player than those two put together. "
8366,Newcastle,"Cross posting my thoughts from soccer:

This game really evaporated any slim hope I had left for top 5. Even top 8 is starting to feel difficult atm. Yes, I know it’s just one game and we were the much better side for 60 mins, but the team just doesn’t feel good enough at the moment and I don’t think Botman will change that when he returns since defence isn’t the major issue. Gordon, Isak etc. aren’t playing near the level they were last season. There’s been nothing world class about them in front of goal this season. 5 goals in 6 games at SJP and 13 goals in total is awful for the team. Only Barnes finishing is good enough for this level, but unfortunately he really struggles elsewhere on the pitch.

I think our midfielders have been very average. Bruno doesn’t dominate the midfield like it felt he did during our CL qualifying season and parts of last season, none of the others are really stepping up either (I’m giving Tonali a pass on this since he’s yet to really be given a full chance imo). Joelinton is way too uneven at the moment (some moments of magic, but more often too sloppy), Willock unfortunately was too anonymous today and Longstaff is simply too limited for us. Some sloppy defensive errors later and you find yourself losing 2-0 down in a match you should be winning. And those final 30 mins were atrocious, we looked just as clueless as Craig Pawson when not calling that Wilson pen.

There is still a long way to go and we still have a good shot at silverware in the League Cup, but I just am not convinced by our season so far. We look like any other mediocre midtable side at the moment, swinging from “we are so back” to “it’s so over” after each game. Realistically, top 8 is what we should be aiming for (even at the start of the season), but even that will be a big ask if the team continues to look this bleak upfront. I know you don’t have to win every game to reach top 8, there are still signs of promise in the way we play. But at this rate, we simply aren’t good enough. I have faith in Howe, but this feels like his “make or break” season. I really hope he succeeds and we finish top 8. It’s chance creation that is the real weakness and has for a while. 

We don’t have any creativity in the team. No one that breaks the line with passes. 

We rely on wing play and we can beat a team in a counter with pace but we’re so far off top teams in attack. 

Getting the ball out wide to Gordon in the left against a low block is not good because his shooting isn’t great from the edge of the box. 

Getting it out to the left isn’t good because Joelinton is Joelinton. Murphy can be good for a cross but Isak isn’t that much of an aerial threat."
8367,Newcastle,"West Ham played well but we were SO sloppy. We also don't know how to break teams down when they shift into a defensive formation. We only score on the counter or in transitions. 

We need signings in Jan or it will be an ugly season. "
8368,Newcastle,Game off 2 half's in my opinion. 1st half thought we were unlucky to be losing but second half we just looked like we had accepted our fate. Main concern from this would be the amount of second balls we seem to lose 
8369,Newcastle,"Not acceptable to say they didn't try. First half was okay but not at all clinical, second half from 50 minutes on was absolutely terrible.

I thought Hall was pretty much the only decent performance- unlucky with that absolutely beautiful pass for the offside goal.

Kelly though.... He is awful. Just well, well below par for a Premier League defender. Passing as negative and poor as Jamal Lewis and defending like a drunk Boumsong. He lost his man for their 1st goal and was pretty calamitous throughout except for one good last minute tackle. He makes Burn look like Maldini. All of this comes from our abysmal transfer window in the summer. We have a WEAKER squad than September 2023. I that's the level of signings we're going for then we need to abandon all hope,

We were truly terrible but still had enough chances to win that game- Willock had one of his worst games for a long time even before his injury. Longstaff played a couple nice passes actually but still lacking at crucial times. Joelinton worked on the right in one game- it doesn't mean he's a good solution for RW. I thought Tonali was disappointing as well though after coming on.

Just incredibly frustrating- we should've won that match. "
8370,Newcastle,"it can't possibly be as simple as ""we can't play against a low block"", can it? 

we got into good areas, had some nice passages of play yesterday but the final ball or finish was often atrocious. I don't know how much of this is on the manager, when the players put in performances like that. "
8371,Newcastle,"2 shots on target today, ZERO SHOTS ON TARGET in the second half when we were down 1-0 and then 2-0.

This was coming for a long time now. The arrogance of our fanbase to think West Ham would limp over for us - and they ended up beating us so comfortably, they deserved this win 100%.

Howe's first mistake was that starting XI but sure I expected this. But the absolute calamity of decisions in that 2nd half, destroying our entire midfield with his substitutions which killed the game 30 minutes before the end. He panicked so hard and it's so clear he doesn't have a plan B if/when things don't go well.

No one today played well, so many misplaced passes and mistakes. Kelly was the worst, Gordon again showing he has the worst mental strength/attitude when the game doesn't go his way (loves a sulk), the entire midfield was pants and just really really poor.

Our first half was good but what's the point when we're not clinical with our passes. West Ham put on a pure masterclass in icing the game and did what Forest didn't last week. But to do this at home is just really really poor.

I understand why people think Howe has peaked with this team now - either the team or him has to change and I don't see it happening anytime soon. "
8372,Newcastle,Devoid of tactics 
8373,Newcastle,Utterly deflating. Fuck off Newcastle United 
8374,Newcastle,I really believe that it's just another 2 poor performances away now from the board statement that begins \`we would like to thank Eddie Howe... however we believe he has taken the team as far as he can and new leadership is required. 
8375,Newcastle,Empty seats at the end are almost as embarrassing as that performance.  I don't blame them the game looked lost 5 minutes before half time.
8376,Newcastle,"Howe needs to go. No identity, no urgency, no tactics, no Tonali. Time's up, go and get Terzic, Allegri, even Potter or Poch if he wants to drop the US team. We need a top manager to get us competing and Howe just isn't it Not potter. I think Eddie deserves time to turn it round as frustrating as it is watching games like today. Bring me xavi or terzic. Allegri won’t come."
8377,Newcastle,"All on Howe there -

His stubbornness insisting on this formation and play-style and even worse Longstaff is just embarrassing and it’s just genuinely a black mark against him 

*How* people can say Longstaff is an important player for us seriously needs their head checked, what a horrid player - complete hologram who’s as much use as an ashtray on a motorbike ‘Because we win more when he starts’"
8378,Newcastle,"Two weeks i waited for that. When the West Ham fans were “ole’ing” their passes we barely broke into a jog to win the ball back. Don’t worry, we have the media darlings next Wednesday who we’ve not beaten in like a decade!? We are just spurs now. "
8379,Newcastle,Get a cb this january. Then get a new dm so tonali and Bruno can play further up. None of this longstaff and joelinton bs anymore 
8380,Newcastle,"Maybe it is time to sell some of our prized assets? Like Isak and/or Bruno. That would bring a good amount of funds to rebuild with whatever we need. Isak at the moment seems totally dull and no longer interested. Bruno is so inconsistent that you never really know what kind of game we will have since so much centers around him. He was far better a couple of years ago. Dont know what has happened... :( Been saying it for a while, club needs to decide if they want to build income or win now. It’s an unpopular opinion. But holding on to them has meant the whole squad is weakened. We’re so reliant on Isak to be magical every week. 

But this midfield make up is the most confusing. Eddie wants his all around players but won’t use his best ones. Sell joelinton, almiron, Murphy, lascelles, trippier, longstaff"
8381,Newcastle,Absolutely shocking second half. I’ve never seen a team have less urgency when 2 goals down. Players just slowing play down not trying any positive passes or runs for 45 minutes. 
8382,Newcastle,"Obviously we had 3 bad transfer windows in a row, bedwetters were right all along. But Howe also is to blame for this mess. 

WE CANT CREATE CHANCES. Who blocked almiron transfer last season? Who decided against buying RW and instead focuing on Guehi? Was it Howe? Then, right now, he gets what he deserves. Tbh from that performance a CB looks like a bigger priority. Not going to win many games when you concede first 9 times of 10 We blocked the Almiron sale because they lowered their bid after we had already accepted it.

We tried to sign a RW as well but that failed, and we did not have a long list of backup targets because our wonderful Director of Football decided to piss off to Man Red.

As for the focus on Guehi, we desperately need a backup / replacement for Schar, I will remind you that we had 0 center backs on the bench today. RW is still an issue but with Murphy, Gordon, Joelinton, Barnes and Miggy all able to play there, as opposed to Schar and Krafth as our only right footed CBs we obviously identified CB as a more pressing need."
8383,Newcastle,"Everyone was poor out there tonight, we looked complacent almost like we thought we had the game won before it started.

Hindsight is 20/20 but we clearly needed some changes to the starting line up tonight to shake things up a bit. "
8384,Newcastle,Couldn’t put the ball in the back of the net when we made chances. Then reverted to pumping the ball up the pitch when we were desperate knowing we can’t win a long ball or a header to save our lives. We were far too frustrating to watch. 
8385,Newcastle,"Reminded me of the Fulham game, midfield so flat and so much space between the lines, got passed through like they weren't there. Hugely missing a pacey CB like lascelles or botman to let us close up that space a bit "
8386,Newcastle,"Sums up the performances that we wanted to make more subs than we were able to.

We wanted to sub off 6 players.
6 of 11. "
8387,Newcastle,well that sure was a game huh 
8388,Newcastle,Well that didn’t quite go to plan did it!? 
8389,Newcastle,"As soon as both goals went in, heads dropped. No-one covered themselves in glory today. 

What I particularly noticed was Barnes' passing was pretty poor, Kelly kept heading the ball clear straight to a West ham player

We were also doing a lot of backwards and sideways play (not surprising when West ham had everyone back), and there was a lot of dithering on the ball "
8390,Newcastle,"Feel Eddie has been all or nothing with his subs this season, either rescued the game or completely fell apart.

Tonight was the latter. "
8391,Newcastle,"Zero mental strength in that side. It’s an age issue, some players are younger than me"
8392,Newcastle,"I think we have went from the fact we had a lot of injuries and extra games last season as a good cover for a lot of underlying problems with this squad. We don’t have anything outside of 4-3-3 as a tactic, we even threw another striker on and ended with Isak out wide. 

Howe must have lost all trust in Miggy/Murphy to be playing Joelinton well out of position on the right as well.

That game has shown a lot of them players they aren’t as good as they think they are. And we do need to improve and sort out a few key positions in summer if not in January. 442 worked so much better???

433 isn’t the problem. The specific instructions to players and decision making is. 

On the Miggy/murphy debate. Murphy got his chance early season. He didn’t take it. We should’ve given Miggy a chance. We generally play better with him as frustrating as he is. I sense he’s left out to force him out. I don’t like Gordon RW. He’s good 1 in 4 games. He’s a LW. Joelinton is hit and miss. In a good day he’s great. On a bad day (like today) all he does is trip over and give away possession."
8393,Newcastle,"I never ever ever want to see that 4 4 2 again oh my god, was like Brucey ball. Had Murphy’s woeful crosses and all to match. "
8394,Newcastle,Ghastly. Go overseas for a camp and come back with that garbage. 
8395,Newcastle,"Ffs 🤦 thought this would be 3 points in the bag, upto 6th in the league and 1 point behind champs league places. 

Missed opportunity. "
8396,Newcastle,"Was at a gig. Saw the scoreline... Yikes. 

Saw a few on socials puzzled about the formation we were playing. 

Sounded like a bad night. "
8397,Newcastle,"We play in a way that's good for retaining possession against a block, but we look petrified to actually make a run or put a cross in, so how do we expect to score? Towards the end we probably went a bit too far the other way and just had Murphy smashing crosses in at every opportunity but I don't think he was really looking to see if anyone was there or not.

Defensively we just looked so easy to play through and for a lot of the game I can't tell if we were actually trying to press them or not. To give credit to West Ham they played some neat football when we were pressing them properly and managed to squeeze passes through quite often and we couldn't manage to do that at all.

The subs felt a bit panicky - this season our subs and ability to change the game when it's not going our way has been much improved but today it just felt like we threw people on hoping to change something without really knowing what it is we wanted to change. Just a shite day at the office overall really. Damned if we do damned if we don’t. 

When we take risks we concede counters and are shit at defending them. 

When we don’t take risks we have all the creativity of a Southgate side."
8398,Newcastle,"What's the point in VAR if that doesn't get given? When the commentators can't even suggest a reason it isn't given, you know the refs have fucked up "
8399,Newcastle,Last I checked grabbing and jumping on a player is not playing for the ball rather the man. VAR and refs fucked that call up. 
8400,Newcastle,Standards of refereeing is abysmal in the prem. If I stood at the turnstiles and let every fan poke me in the eye I'd still have seen things better than they did today 😂
8401,Newcastle,"Usually I’d be up in arms at this, but after that performance, I’m weirdly not arsed. Every week it’s like the powers that be just try to make me enjoy football less and less That’s how I felt. We should have had a penalty. We still would have lost."
8402,Newcastle,"I’m just so done with all of this. If those ones aren’t even getting overturned, you know they’re just looking out for their mates. West Ham fans will be screaming “no way” but happy to take their shitty pen against the Man Reds a few weeks back. Week after week after week, it’s just the same. Football surely has a decade left at the most? Even the link above has West Ham fans saying it's a pen. Doubt we would've gone on to get another, but it's just another demonstration of how absolutely shite VAR is. Fascinating how they can be so incompetent week after week."
8403,Newcastle,Can we cry DISGRACIA and demand the release of VAR audio or is that only allowed for six certain clubs 
8404,Newcastle,Almost like we voted against the prem on Friday 
8405,Newcastle,Was Wilson offside? I hope… 
8406,Newcastle,"The only solution for me is dissolution of PGMOL and set up of two professional bodies - one for onfield refs and one for VAR. the relationship is far far too cosy. They don’t want to embarrass their colleagues.

I genuinely also think the pace of the professional game at the highest level is too much for one man to officiate. You can count reliable refs in the prem on the fingers of one hand - it’s only Michael Oliver. If someone has to be truly exceptional to just be reliable, then something needs to change.

I think the solution is more interventions using technology is required, with less overall responsibility for the on field ref. Any fan could have a couple of glances at a replay on a screen and make a decision for key moments that was justifiable. 

Having an overall team with collective responsibility for executive decisions, not just the ref, would significantly improve the quality of decision making.

With this should be accountability - officials should be miked up and the audio should be included on live tv feeds and, for key decisions, in stadiums. Also with technology, there should be significant delays - in only exceptional circumstances with real complexity (thinking our goal v Arsenal last season) should decisions take a few minutes.

Hit me up on the blower Howard Webb "
8407,Newcastle,Well I for one think players should be allowed to be a human backpack 
8408,Newcastle,"I am not seeing it one bit. Otherwise every single corner would be a penalty.

Right decision for me. Let's try not to be biased. "
8409,Newcastle,"Nah, not a penalty imo, not enough in it.  Don't think Wilson is getting on the end of that, certainly not enough to get the ball down and on target, defender has a right to try to jump for the ball, he's taking a risk with the arms round the opponents but I just think it's too soft to be a foul. Whilst there's contact I think it's not actually impeding Wilson that much, it's more Wilson triyng to make a meal of it to win the penalty, strikers do this regularly in that split second where they know they aren't getting to the ball but there's contact with a defender trying to stop them. "
8410,Newcastle,😂 
8411,Newcastle,That’s how I felt. We should have had a penalty. We still would have lost. 
8412,Newcastle,"Even the link above has West Ham fans saying it's a pen. Doubt we would've gone on to get another, but it's just another demonstration of how absolutely shite VAR is. Fascinating how they can be so incompetent week after week. They have no incentive to change. This Cootes video helps show the level of disdain they have for players, managers and fans alike. They should bin off the PGMOL completely and hire in another body of refs from a foreign league. No more excuses, just don’t hire them ever again. Teach them a lesson that way."

8414,Newcastle,"I think that tells the whole story: 

1. You kept coming back to this post 
2. Multiple views were necessary
3. Something went wrong "
8415,Newcastle,Was just about to post the same thing 😂 
8416,Newcastle,Proud to be a happy clapper 
8417,Newcastle,"All those hours for a third choice goalkeeper.

Aye. "
8418,Newcastle,Aye 
8419,Newcastle,"Mods ban me first then…

No disrespect to the Megathread, or even you lot, i don’t know you all but you seem nice.

I did that for a little while then i felt my sanity slipping away (especially with nothing that happened in this window)

So you are either mentally stronger than I, or have a couple screws loose Yes You'll float down here in the summer transfer megathread, we all do"
8420,Newcastle,My “You kept coming back to this post” was the 5th Round FA Cup Match Thread vs Blackburn. Absolutely thrilling stuff. 
8421,Newcastle,What's a Reddit recap and where do I find it? Like Spotify unwrapped but more depressing. Top right of screen on app. The yellow thing that is supposed to be a banana...
8422,Newcastle,Yes 
8423,Newcastle,"You'll float down here in the summer transfer megathread, we all do "
8424,Newcastle,"Like Spotify unwrapped but more depressing. Top right of screen on app. The yellow thing that is supposed to be a banana... Cheers, can't see a banana here. Just my avatar"
8425,Newcastle,"Cheers, can't see a banana here. Just my avatar Odd. If you go [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/recap/) does it give you option to see your recap?"
8426,Newcastle,"Odd. If you go [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/recap/) does it give you option to see your recap? Awesome thanks, got the same haha"
8427,Newcastle,"Awesome thanks, got the same haha "
8428,Newcastle,"This is the best our bench has looked in some time. Trippier, Wilson, Barnes and Tonali all likely to come on at some point. Put a stupid grin all over my face I can’t get rid of Idk, I don’t know how I feel about only having one substitute goalkeeper. We’re gonna feel pretty stupid if Pope and Dubravka both get injured Good to see Targett back too. By contrast, their bench is dreadful."
8429,Newcastle,"Lewis Miley not in the squad. Injury, or lack of room on the bench? probs the latter I think I read it's lack of room on the bench.

Personally I think it's the wrong call. We play with one striker so realistically only Wilson or Osula can come on, whereas we have three midfielders and only one on the bench.

Furthermore we have Murphy, Barnes and Almiron on the bench when only two can realistically play at the same time."
8430,Newcastle,Wilson on the bench! The sight of him will give the hammers PTSD 
8431,Newcastle,"That's quite the bench, if i do say so myself "
8432,Newcastle,Wilson off the bench with the winner We'll be 4-0 up when he comes on to score our 5th.
8433,Newcastle,"Hate that they list them by number instead of position, Except Pope? I think it’s to have some gamesmanship about where in the front three (for example) people are playing?"
8434,Newcastle,West Ham have basically no midfield. Tonali should've started imo but we'll see how this goes. He wasn't allowed. Unsportsmanlike behaviour to just utterly destroy them. 4-0 is enough Not a bad team for a mob with no midfield…
8435,Newcastle,"Wilson bags a double off the bench today, he loves West Ham "
8436,Newcastle,"Quite glad Osula has at least made the bench, thought he'd disappear when/if Wilson returned. 

Trips back could be monumental "
8437,Newcastle,So same as before break but Kelly instead of Burn Yeah but look our bench
8438,Newcastle,Canny bench. 
8439,Newcastle,I can see why he’s kept Longstaff in but would’ve liked to see Tonali starting. Why can you see why (lol)? West Ham are going to  play a low block and Longstaff is useless against a team that sits back. We don't need a workhorse when we need a creative spark
8440,Newcastle,"Love Sandro, but do want ask some people here, why change a winning team?

I'm sure he'll get his chance when Big Joe is suspended / Willock gets injured I feel like we’ve been saying Sandro ‘will get his chance’ ever since he’s returned, yet he’s not had a meaningful stay in the starting XI. He’s miles ahead of Longstaff in terms of quality. 

Never really understood the ‘don’t change a winning team’ feeling either. Just cause they won doesn’t mean the team can’t still be improved. Say Isak hadn’t started our last game because of injury or whatever, would we really not put him into the team again just because they won the last game? Horses for courses sandro is much more creative west ham will play a low block, longstaff is not a creative player. > Why change a winning team? 

Because it's not 1992 anymore and football tactics have moved on."
8441,Newcastle,"As expected, only change is an enforced one 

Kelly in for Burn "
8442,Newcastle,That's a stacked ass bench 
8443,Newcastle,Wilson super sub ... goal 60 + minutes 
8444,Newcastle,"Outsider looking in, I got Barnes in my fantasy football what does he need to do to get a start he seems to score fairly regularly but never gets in the first 11 It would require injury crisis or a new manager. Howe has his favourite xi and Barnes isn't in it. Have to make do with super sub appearances (which are actually in fairness usually better than if he starts)"
8445,Newcastle,WTH is this thing called a bench?! 
8446,Newcastle,"Only flaws I guess is Sandro not getting a start (again) and only having 1 out and out midfielder on the bench (although Joe can drop in as well I guess). Otherwise, looks good and think we’ve got a great chance if the lads turn up! "
8447,Newcastle,Put a stupid grin all over my face I can’t get rid of I'm sure the way they played probably got rid of it for you!
8448,Newcastle,"Idk, I don’t know how I feel about only having one substitute goalkeeper. We’re gonna feel pretty stupid if Pope and Dubravka both get injured Fucking hell imagine if that happens after a season of 2 or 3 keepers on the bench"
8449,Newcastle,Good to see Targett back too. 
8450,Newcastle,"By contrast, their bench is dreadful. "
8451,Newcastle,"I think I read it's lack of room on the bench.

8457,Newcastle,"Why can you see why (lol)? West Ham are going to  play a low block and Longstaff is useless against a team that sits back. We don't need a workhorse when we need a creative spark Winding Sandro up for a super sub appearance in the second half.  Tonali for Longstaff will have more impact on the later game than Longstaff for Tonali.

Eddie has a similar approach with Barnes. Longy is workhorse if ever I knew one I see it in a way that it’s been working how it is so that’s why he doesn’t want to change but yes Tonali would’ve been better."
8458,Newcastle,"I feel like we’ve been saying Sandro ‘will get his chance’ ever since he’s returned, yet he’s not had a meaningful stay in the starting XI. He’s miles ahead of Longstaff in terms of quality.

Say Isak hadn’t started our last game because of injury or whatever, would we really not put him into the team again just because they won the last game? If England has shown me anything its that the best players don't always make a better team. The team look soo much more balanced with longstaff there. 

Tonali is the better player but from previous games of Bruno, tonali and joelinton starting we've been absolutely dog shit and midfield bypassed with 1 pass The stats are true though, Longstaff starting wins us games.

Not a problem at all if we're bringing 60mil players off the bench Howe is just not a good enough elite coach to figure things out and incapable of changing a winning side until something really bad happens. 

You mentioned Isak.....

I remember he benched Isak during the Carabao Cup final against Manchester United when honestly, we should have started him. We know why he kept Wilson."
8459,Newcastle,"Horses for courses sandro is much more creative west ham will play a low block, longstaff is not a creative player. That's a fair answer, I personally prefer a more settled team, but its a nice problem to have a quality player like Tonali making the other midfielders have to keep up their game Sandro was immense when he came on as a sub, played well and scored for italy in the break, then gets put back on the bench. Not sure what more he could do tbf."
8460,Newcastle,"> Why change a winning team? 

Because it's not 1992 anymore and football tactics have moved on. Okay I'll bite, this season we've tried a lot of line-ups that didn't work, including with Tonali, but since we've put Longstaff back in with Joelinton on the wing, I think we've looked a lot more balanced and steady"

Howe is a better manager than that, and need to cut out his tendency to be too loyal to players. Elite managers - and Howe could be one - pick the team for the game ahead not based on the last result."

He's a professional so he's not going to say anything in public, but when Ryan Fraser asked to play more Howe said he would, then didn't play him more so he asked to leave and Howe banished him to the reserves.

8485,Newcastle,"I both agree and disagree with Luke here. 

Location is fantastic, nobody can disagree with that. But I’m only open to leaving this site if it’s a partial leave and we are shifting slightly north into Leazes Park / where that car park is. If it’s an option to build a new stadium there while maintaining a very similar footprint, I’m on board. 

Give me good renders of Castle Leazes/Hunters Moor/Arena (if still possible) and I can probably be persuaded that it’s the right decision. 

Staying at SJP would be fantastic if a Bernabeu-level revamp/rebuild can happen but I’d have to wait and see feasibility plans. 

Either way, exciting times ahead A huge stadium on Castle Leazes in sandstone, and reflecting the architecture of the castle keep, will be our new castle on the hill. Aye this is the best way IMO"
8486,Newcastle,"I’m sure lots of fans from Arsenal, West Ham, Tottenham were up in arms about leaving their respective old grounds, but with maybe the exception of West Ham it’s turned out for the better.  

Old Trafford will go soon as well I expect, and Goodison is in its final season. Stadiums built a century ago can’t go on indefinitely, times change and a new ground is inevitable at some point. Yes but Arsenal and Spurs new stadiums are a stones throw from their old ones. That’s the point. We’re not attached to the 4 stands, we’re attached to the location All 3 of these stadiums are awful, ugly and have 0 atmopshere. 

I like new Everton stadium in terms of design, but Goodison was too small & ugly anyway. Polar opposite of SJP. Renovation is a must."
8487,Newcastle,"icl leaving St James would be terrible Yeah I agree, I’m quite surprised how readily people seem willing to leave the place that’s been our home from before we were even united St James’ with 4 equal stands and a standing gallowgate would be the best stadium in the world I would rather never having a season ticket than seeing it leave the city. Unless we can expand it. It’s not like we need the money. It’s just the stupid rules put in place to prevent another City from threatening the top 6. I tend to agree but would like to see plans of what is possible before fully deciding Considering where it is, traffic would be a nightmare if they started knocking it down. There’d be a ton of disruption."
8488,Newcastle,"I would rather have increased capacity as someone who's a lifelong local supporter.

I can't get tickets to games despite being local, but I see that influencers, international fans, and others generally don't have an issue.

Due to life circumstances and bad timing, I couldn't get a season ticket before takeover despite the fact I could buy two right now, it will be impossible for me to get one in the next 10 years.

The only chance I have is if they increase the capacity and the number of season tickets available or if they price fans out of the market (which I obviously don't want to happen). Otherwise, the only chance I have is risking the ballot (0 wins so far) or buying hospitality packages, which I've had to do once this season already.

I love St James Park, but as someone who can't get a ticket most of the time for love nor the money, they can make so much more revenue with a bigger stadium and/or capacity. I can't help think that the horse has bolted, no matter the outcome of this. As the club looks for commercial growth, a certain type of fan is always going to be left behind. 

Stay at 52k, fans can't get tickets.

Raise to 65k, ticket prices soar to pay it off. Can I respectfully and genuinely ask what you mean when you say that international fans generally don't have an issue?  I've been a fan of the club for over 20 years over in the USA, and my 15 year old son is now a huge fan as well.  We love watching the matches together on TV but the dream is to take one in at SJP in person one day.  My partner and I offered each of the 3 kids a trip anywhere they want to go on their 16th birthdays, and my son wants to use his to go to Newcastle.  

But I don't see any way to get tickets.  Of course we want the full experience of being in the stands and singing and cheering.  But that seems completely off the table.  Like, literally impossible.  Am I missing something?  Like, I'm genuinely asking here!  The only way I know is hospitality, which I'd accept, but apparently now those are selling out so fast it may be impossible (and due to school schedules, we're very limited on which matches we could attend in the first place.)  Even the ones that are 500 pounds per may not be available.

I understand that the club is for the people of Newcastle.  I understand people would have strong attachments to the stadium and its location.  But I am desperate, *desperate* to figure out how to make this work.  I admit it's pretty disheartening to read some of the comments.  Like, I'm very sorry but considering a hospitality ticket does not make me a ""posh twat"" to quote an upvoted comment.  I'm just trying to get to a match any way I possibly can!"
8489,Newcastle,"Frankly I would just like there to be a decision made. I know it isnt an easy decision and there needs to be a lot of thought into the planning of it, but I'm just so tired of the constant flip flopping between refurb and move.

Until a serious potential site has been announced for us to voice our opinions on it just feels like constant circle jerking. "
8490,Newcastle,"What is a club in any case? Not the noise, the passion, the feeling of belonging. It's about long-term commercial growth and returns on investments, marketing team KPIs and those in executive boxes.

It's a small boy clambering past the corporate seats for the very first time, by himself because his father couldn't afford to go, gawping at that generic stretch of turf beneath him, and without being able to do a thing about it, falling in love with the club's commercial growth strategy. If that small boy practices really hard, then one day he might be able to be sold by the club for PSR reasons."
8491,Newcastle,"I do find it strange that people would be ok with a complete rebuild at SJP, aka a totally new stadium, but would be dead against a new stadium on Leazes Park, a stone’s throw away. Assuming a new SJP would also not be called SJP either, but would bear the name of a sponsor - what would actually remain of it bar memories and feelings? In that case why does any of it matter? Even the sloped pitch would be gone. "
8492,Newcastle,"I'm split on the stadium, ideally would love to stay but understand we need to expand to grow as a club.

If we do move, I think we'd have to do it a certain way to keep everyone happy so keep it city centre, ideally close to St James existing site. 

If we do build a new stadium we should do something with the current St Jame site. Personally I would I love to see us build another smaller modern stadium (25kish capacity maybe?) and use it as a home for the women's team and youth teams as well as a multi-purpose venue (gigs, other sport events etc.. I would also build in a bit of a NUFC museum/park space in there too and make it special so we don't loose our home. You could even keep a patch of the St James pitch (in thinking penalty spot at the Gallowgate) and make it a feature. 

Theres loads we can and should do to keep the St James site special if we do leave which would keep people happy I think. Liverpool upgraded and modernized stand by stand.
Might be worth looking at"
8493,Newcastle,"Love SJP, first memory of it I wasn't even big enough to see over the people in the seats in front, but honestly it was always a bit fugly, it's like an old mining cottage with a huge out of place extension wacked on to it. If we build a new stadium behind and then convert the SJP land into an actual park that leads to the new stadium it'll be a huge win for the city and the club. "
8494,Newcastle,"I'm agreeing with Puke Edwards on a Monday morning.

Thanks, week ruined. “Puke” Edwards?

JFC how old are you?"
8495,Newcastle,"I'm not sure what Edwards opinions on the mater are because this article was just posted to create more animosity, I don't disagree with what he said but his words are just hollow platitudes, he can always fuck right off. Is the correct answer. This is shit-stirring dressed as sycophancy. He knows exactly what he's doing and that is trying to cause division and trouble amongst the fanbase. The guy is a total prick who I would cheerfully never hear a word from ever again and be no poorer for it."
8496,Newcastle,If Luke Edwards thinks it’s a bad idea to leave it’s probably a good idea 
8497,Newcastle,"i agree but think abt it look at it with a head and not a heart. imagine the things we could do with that money. spurs get at least 100m from all the things they do with their stadium. concerts, nfl, all sorts. not only that but its state of the art. their still paying it back but thats not an issue with us. PIF will jst write the cheque and say ""build it"" because they have the money. plus they arent gonna move us into somewhere like morpeth or gateshead. i think they said leazes park im not sure. 

Obviously i dont want to leave SJP because its not only iconic, but its got an amazing location, the atmosphere is electric and so so many iconic moments happened there.

Unfortunately though we've just got to let go. as much as we dont want to, it has to be done at one point. "
8498,Newcastle,"Luke doing his best to throw spanners in the works again - he's always so negative.  Ideally staying at St James' would be the best, but the concourses in the stadium are old, cramped, and are unable to be updated.  The toilets are horrendous and don't cater for the number of people who need to use them.  The WiFi and phone connectivity is non existant for most people (this is an issue throughout town, especially on a matchday with the increase in people, but if the ground had good WiFi it would act as another positive for people to spend more time there).  The food stalls are too small and the queues make the concourses even tighter, the bars again are too cramped with queues and are too small for the staff.

There's no way we'd be able to upgrade St James' on the current site  unless we moved it north a hundred feet or so, built the new Leazes end, then managed to find somewhere else to play for two years whilst the current ground is demolished and the new Gallowgate built, which is another quandary as there are no appropriate stadiums nearby to use.  The only viable solution (if it even is a solution due to its own complexities) is to build a new ground in Leazes park.  Other than that we'd have to extend St James' into Strawberry Place and potentially build a fan zone for season ticket holders to go to in lieu of improving the concourse areas, but there'll be access issues with that.

I've been a season ticket holder for 37 years. "
8499,Newcastle,"Realistically the cost to upgrade St James Park and the revenue it will generate is not worthwhile. 

If we can in some way negate all the restrictions then build exactly what we want that would be one thing but the reality is we won’t be able to do so.

By spending money now on St James Park we are just creating a huge problem again for later.

We will struggle to generate the necessary infrastructure and revenues by upgrading St James Park and the revenues we can generate could be doubled by building a brand new top notch venue with no restrictions on its build. 

We can’t do this by staying where we are. 

We may be able to do it by moving it further into Leazes Park but there is a likelihood that doing that would cause uproar too. 

Doing that could create a top notch stadium but  also may come with added upgrade expansion issues down the line due to the proximity of the lake. 

In a perfect world we’d just pick up St James park and put the new stadium on its place and it would fit perfectly, realistically that can’t happen.

Leazes or a new build elsewhere is a good option as it lets us stay and play while the build happens. (At least partially with Leazes) 

If we stay we have to accept reduced revenues and that is not what the Saudis will desire. 

They will want a club and infrastructure that is the envy of the world here.

They probably can’t do that if we stay at St James Park and in the future it would become unviable to stay eventually as it likely couldn’t be further upgraded in the future.

Unfortunately Luke Edward’s is cog in a wheel of a media who appear to have a vested interest in creating division and keeping us as a club from progressing to the upper echelons.

They are using the division they can create by cementing the idea in peoples heads that the clubs stadium must be in the city centre. 

Realistically very few clubs have the necessary space to put top notch infrastructure in the centre of their home town/city. 

That means they frequently need to move in order to do it properly.

Whilst in theory it could be feasible to buy up everything surrounding St James Park that causes such expansion any issues and with enough money anything can be done I am sure there are limits on what the Saudis are willing to put into such a project.

You would probably also have to do something about the underground too as the risk of a collapse would be catastrophic. 

Ultimately it will be down to them how much they value having the stadium in the centre of the city and how much they desire to have world class facilities and top revenues from that with the options to expand in future. 

If it were me with a business head on there is no question I’d move it, whilst as a fan I can appreciate the emotional ties to it, ultimately must head probably rule over the heart in this case. "
8500,Newcastle,"Love how the talk here is about revenue.

What about the people who can’t go?
What about the next generation of fans?

It’s so hard to get tickets "
8501,Newcastle,"Good to see the 'true fan' brigade is out in strength to explain why anyone who isn't bothered about staying SJP is a soulless plastic. 

The perfect solution would be to redevelop SJP, but then I imagine the 'true fan' brigade would have problems with that as well.

I'd love for Newcastle to have a stadium equal to or better than the one Spurs have. "
8502,Newcastle,"Literally no where else we can play while it’s being developed. He’s said that can be resolved. It can’t. Notice how nothing has been suggested. We could always talk to the Mackems about sharing their shitehole - no, it's no good, I fucking *live* in Sunderland and I can't say that with a straight face. The bondibot video had three sides of a new ground being completed just to the north west of the Leazes then the remaining stand done after demolition of the current ground. If that is really practical I don't know but I trust the club."
8503,Newcastle,Edwards knows nothing about Newcastle’s soul. Populist shitepiece. he's hardly a populist. he was getting pilloried all the time for defending Steve Bruce.
8504,Newcastle,"It’s part of the price of evolving into a world class team. Spurs did it, City did it, West Ham did it. 

All these clubs had history with their grounds, but you need to make smart business decisions. 

SJP isn’t terrible but if we can create a world class stadium, it helps us in our journey to become a world class club.  I'm not sure West Ham fans would universally agree that their stadium move was the best of decisions they could have made, yeah they got a bigger stadium, but there was a lot of less tangible elements that they lost in terms of the soul and spirit of the club. I think it took a bit of time for Spurs to get that soul back, and it's not like the Etihad's reputation is notable in this sense.

It's also worth noting that all these clubs had relatively small and old fashioned stadiums in comparison to what they have now. St James might be a bit old fashioned in comparison to some of the newer shiny ones, but it's not small.

It will be interesting to see how Everton feel once they're in their new stadium.

I'm not totally opposed to us moving to a new stadium, but I think people are right to be cautious. Man U didn’t, Liverpool didn’t, Chelsea didn’t. Chelsea also have wanted to for a while but they can’t > It’s part of the price of evolving into a world class team.

No it isn't. And even if it is, we don't have to do it now. 

Build a world class team and create the demand for a new stadium before you go tearing up our history and soul with stupid decisions like this."
8505,Newcastle,He’s right He's never right.
8506,Newcastle,"They’ve been soft-briefing leaving for ages 

This is what you sign away your soul for ultimately "
8507,Newcastle,I'm not local therefore my opinion isn't really important but personally I'd rather we don't move just so I can go to a few more games. I hope they get input from local fans before making the final decision (both ST holders and non) because it's their city in the end. Ultimately I am an emotional fan and to me the clubs soul is the land we currently play on in whatever form that may take on top of it. It's where my grandad watched the team and his dad and his... 
8508,Newcastle,"I’m telling you now, leave St. James’ Park and the club drifts towards being just another club with fuck all identity. The club would never be the same again. Money would be generated by a new stadium and yes it would buy better players but players come and go. You can’t put a price on what St. James’ Park is and what it means to the city and the people. "
8509,Newcastle,While I'm firmly on the fence with regards to the stadium debate. I'll never take the opinion on issues such as these seriously of a 'journalist' who is given free tickets and unprecedented levels of freedom to every fixture all while they support a club at the other end of the country. 
8510,Newcastle,"Then we don't leave, we can't expand and we stay with the current capacity. 


Then what? "
8511,Newcastle,well said 
8512,Newcastle,"The stadium is fundamentally part of the three core values that make us us.

The other two are the name and the colours. "
8513,Newcastle,"It just all depends on the relocation, if they decide they need a new stadium.
A plot of land a few hundred meters away makes no difference. As a writer said on The Mag just the other day, St James’ Park is 100% different to the one he visited as a child decades ago. So what is it exactly that you’re clinging on to? 

However, an actual relocation is a totally different story. Unless you can come up with something that is actively a fantastic idea that improves every aspect compared with current SJP, the ideas a non starter to me.

20,000 extra seats isn’t worth it to lose the heart and soul, the revenue for the local businesses, the drinking spots before & after the game, the craic with the away fans that love to visit. "
8514,Newcastle,This guy doesn't have to walk up the stairs to level 7. 
8515,Newcastle,Meh. Spurs & Arsenal left their grounds & similar things were said. 
8516,Newcastle,"This is the design I liked, almost on the same site just moved a small bit, the current location is brilliant and I wouldn’t like to move to far away,

8517,Newcastle,"I love SJP, but in the FFP hell we now live in our revenues need to increase and to do that we need a bigger multi functional stadium, it won't just be football, we can make money from Boxing ,WWE, Concerts etc. So I am onboard moving to a new stadium. "
8518,Newcastle,"90% of the people who are ultra-keen to move and build a new stadium have never been to St James' in their life. It really is that simple. 

When you see people saying things like ""we need an 80,000 capacity"" it betrays the fact that they are clearly not from the area, or they are fucking stupid. They’re definitely not from Newcastle if they think we have the infrastructure for an 80k stadium I absolutely agree I gave my season ticket up when Ashley forced keegan out, accept I won't get another one and I'm going to be limited to getting to see  1 or 2 low demand games or pay for hospitality tickets but that's OK. At least supporters still get the experience of walking up the hill to the ground and it's a special experience. I think there is more nuance to the argument. 

A new stadium would provide more revenue for the club, would mean that it would be easier to get tickets for games, could be really well built, the construction would generate money for the local area.

I do agree that it is the clubs soul, but there is definitely a trade off between nostalgia and the benefits a new stadium could provide (whichever side of the fence you land on)"
8519,Newcastle,"The real mistake is blind sentimentality.

Football is business, and business 101 is supply and demand.

NUFC currently have more demand than they're able to supply and because of this they've missing out on millions in revenue.

Any extension made to SJP would likely only add 5-10k more seats which again, is not enough to satisfy fan demand or fiscal ambition.

The long term financial health of the club is paramount if we want to catch up with the elite clubs - we have to increase revenue - we can achieve all of this with a new stadium, not to mention improve facilities which would greatly improve the match going experience for supporters.

If the club is serious about becoming ""number one"" globally (the Chairman's direct words) then unfortunately the current SJP or any realistic extension isn't going to be enough to get us there. "

8528,Newcastle,"All 3 of these stadiums are awful, ugly and have 0 atmopshere. 

I like new Everton stadium in terms of design, but Goodison was too small & ugly anyway. Polar opposite of SJP. Renovation is a must. Disagree on spurs, their atmosphere is excellent. I’ve been to both WHL and the new stadium and the new stadium they were much louder.

Emirates was famous for being a library, but now they’re good again it’s picked up."
8529,Newcastle,"Yeah I agree, I’m quite surprised how readily people seem willing to leave the place that’s been our home from before we were even united I can only imagine it's largely people who struggle to get tickets with the current demand, which I understand is massively frustrating, and they make up the loud minority of those wanting the new stadium.

I don't think I've talked to one ST holder who wants to move."
8530,Newcastle,St James’ with 4 equal stands and a standing gallowgate would be the best stadium in the world Yeah it really would. Would be amazing if they find a way to do that. Impossible. Pre-1973......it wasn't even the best stadium in Tyneside (may need to check if Gateshead was built then)
8531,Newcastle,I would rather never having a season ticket than seeing it leave the city. Unless we can expand it. It’s not like we need the money. It’s just the stupid rules put in place to prevent another City from threatening the top 6.

8534,Newcastle,"I can't help think that the horse has bolted, no matter the outcome of this. As the club looks for commercial growth, a certain type of fan is always going to be left behind. 

Stay at 52k, fans can't get tickets.

Raise to 65k, ticket prices soar to pay it off. I think it's inevitable either way, the game has changed substantially, I can't imagine a world where we stay in St James Park, without substanial changes to capacity at the very least, for another 100+ years.

I think if you look at the path other clubs have taken, we won't be any different, and the prices of the tickets will continue to soar and soar as the demand increases. Season tickets for Newcastle are wayyy too cheap, that’s the part of the problem. Far fewer change hands every season. 

If Sam Fender can sell gig tickets to NE postcodes only, why can’t a football club. As someone who lived in London for any years, it was much much easier to get match tickets or season tickets for any of the big London clubs, other than Arsenal, than it is to get Newcastle tickets. Not necessarily, Stadiums don't count against FFP, I can't see our owners passing the cost onto the fans given their wealth, the larger the capacity the less they need to charge, so it goes both ways."
8535,Newcastle,"Can I respectfully and genuinely ask what you mean when you say that international fans generally don't have an issue?  I've been a fan of the club for over 20 years over in the USA, and my 15 year old son is now a huge fan as well.  We love watching the matches together on TV but the dream is to take one in at SJP in person one day.  My partner and I offered each of the 3 kids a trip anywhere they want to go on their 16th birthdays, and my son wants to use his to go to Newcastle.

I think as an international fan, if you want to spend the cash, you will ultimately find a ticket, but you may have to plan your holiday around when you can get a ticket.

You can buy hospitality for most fixtures, if you're not bothered about how much your budget is, but if you want to spend less you could get an international mags+ membership where you enter the ballot with other international members and apply for a ticket - you would unfortunately need a membership for each applicant but you will need to check for under 18s, I believe they're discounted or you don't need a membership altogether but instead an account for your child, which is relatively easy to do, then link them together. 

Then you can apply for family zone ballot tickets where a ticket requirement is at least one under 18 amongst the seats.

8562,Newcastle,"No problem mate. I think as an international fan, if you want to spend the cash, you will ultimately find a ticket, but you may have to plan your holiday around when you can get a ticket.

You can buy hospitality for most fixtures, if you're not bothered about how much your budget is, but if you want to spend less you could get an international mags+ membership where you enter the ballot with other international members and apply for a ticket - you would unfortunately need a membership for each applicant but you will need to check for under 18s, I believe they're discounted or you don't need a membership altogether but instead an account for your child, which is relatively easy to do, then link them together. 

Then you can apply for family zone ballot tickets where a ticket requirement is at least one under 18 amongst the seats. 

My advice is to email the box office via boxoffice@nufc.co.uk who will give you the full rundown and what to do (or if you're not sure check the website for call or email details). Thank you so much!  That is super helpful and I really greatly appreciate it!  I definitely did not realize that it was possible to enter the ballots with an international membership.  I will certainly email the box office as well.  Thanks again!"
8563,Newcastle,"Sounds like a good lad your son Believe me, I don't take for granted that I have a 15 year old who wants to set an alarm for 7:00am on a Saturday so we can throw on our Newcastle jerseys and watch a match together.  He's independent as well and loves going off with his friends but I treasure the time we spend together and Newcastle is no small part of it."
8564,Newcastle,"Old enough to have to Google ""JFC"" "
8565,Newcastle,"100% he will be devastated if we just did a remodel or moved the stadium 200yards up behind, he is hoping they decide to build a new stadium out around South Shields or somewhere so he can come and say how disgusting the fans have been treated by these vile owners and we should be out protesting everyday, his best case scenario is a fan base fighting each other, the cunts writing should be banned from this sub. "
8566,Newcastle,"Don’t think the Police will sanction that. Yeah, I can’t see that happening. It’s more likely to be Middlesbrough"
8567,Newcastle,He’s not a populist but the article content is 
8568,Newcastle,"Terrible examples. Man U fans are begging to move, Chelsea are going to move. Anfield has just been extended. "
8569,Newcastle,"two grounds that are falling down around their ears, and chelsea have been trying to move sign Roman came onto the scene Renovate then so the stadium isn’t falling apart"
8570,Newcastle,"None of those teams have PSR issues If we spend a billion on a stadium, do you really think they won’t use that as an excuse to not allocate more money to transfers?"
8571,Newcastle,Chelsea are in a unique situation where the name of the club is tied to the ground or something 
8572,Newcastle,"Yeah and it's certainly holding back the 2x CL winners isn't it Never said it was mate, agree though on what you’re meaning that by moving stadium or not it really shouldn’t be an access token to success"
8573,Newcastle,"> Build a world class team

well, the catch-22 is that we're going to massively struggle to do that within our current PSR parameters. It's not a catch-22, it's a failing of the ownership"
8574,Newcastle,"haha aye, imagine St James Metro with 80k fans rocking up It’s bad enough at 5pm on weekdays"
8575,Newcastle,"The fact is that we don't ""need"" a new stadium now by any measure. The new owners want it as a vanity project and nowt more. Stay at SJP or qualify for Europe each year? Pick one. Our matchday income is low, that's in part due to the location and competition. The likes of Chelsea have much higher revenues from their stadia."
8576,Newcastle,"They’re kidding themselves if they think tickets will be vastly easier to get with a new stadium This, the goal would be to add more luxury boxes they can sell for a mint, not increase the capacity itself much more than what it already is. They'll make corporate and hospitality alot bigger which is good for the club."
8577,Newcastle,"> I don't think I've talked to one ST holder who wants to move.

Genuinely said with respect, but no shit. Why would somebody with a guaranteed seat in the ground already care about a move? I mean, if the argument is progression vs tradition, rather than just people wanting seats, you would expect some ST holders to want a new stadium. 

I think the only actual divide is solely down to those who have tickets vs those who don't, and using the idea that we need a new stadium to progress is people wanting a reason that looks better than just wanting a seat and being willing to leave SJP to get one.

I'm not saying either is right or wrong btw, I can see the benefits to both, I prefer to stay because I like the idea of maintaining our history, but that's not to say I'm right."
8578,Newcastle,"The thing is, *i* regularly struggle to get tickets… but when I do, it’s special. I would rather get 1/8 (for arguments sake) games at St James rather than 1/4 to the “St James’ Saudia Corporate Enormo-Done Experience” or whatever the fuck it’ll end up as "
8579,Newcastle,"> I don't think I've talked to one ST holder who wants to move. 

Yeah?? Obviously. Most season ticket holders have made their bed and are lying in it. The people who want to move are people without season tickets and who actually want growth in the club. "
8580,Newcastle,ST holders are probably 0.1% of the fanbase though… and of the entire fanbase are probably the people most likely to want to stay? Also the most likely to go to a game
8581,Newcastle,"Sorry man, this is wishful thinking rather than logical. Matchday income does count towards PSR - money being their primary incentive for investing in a new stadium. 

PIF don't see us as a charity case. I meant the cost of building the stadium does not affect our FFP balance, we are not a charity case, it's their business, I don't think Saudi are invested in us to make money 😂 what we make them is peanuts compared to their Gas, Petrol etc."
8582,Newcastle,Thank you so much!  That is super helpful and I really greatly appreciate it!  I definitely did not realize that it was possible to enter the ballots with an international membership.  I will certainly email the box office as well.  Thanks again!

8586,Newcastle,"I loathe Sky... Welcome to Monday night football, Newcastle United take on West Ham, anyway lets chat about Man City. They were on about the other Manchester team before this. Fucking shite."
8587,Newcastle,We do have form for coming back from conceding. If that’s of any comfort. 
8588,Newcastle,This feels like the Brighton game all over again 
8589,Newcastle,No one wants to mention it but Isak has been shite tonight 
8590,Newcastle,Bin off VAR it's a joke at this point 
8591,Newcastle,The results against Arsenal and Forest mean absolutely nothing if you're dropping points at home to West Ham Brighton & West Ham zero points at home is painful when you watch both games
8592,Newcastle,"How to beat Newcastle United. 

1. Low Block.
2. Frustration. 3. Do nothing and let us beat ourselves."
8593,Newcastle,"Shout out to Isak's pressing today btw, can't remember seeing him cover so much ground He can go all out today as Wilson can take over when he has ran to Windsor He knows we've got a striker on the bench so he can run himself knackered quicker 😅 100 percent a 60th minute preplanned sub yet again."
8594,Newcastle,"Wilson limping, see you in pre season "
8595,Newcastle,Joelinton literally stands still who is this melt 
8596,Newcastle,Lloyd Kelly making a free transfer look like a rip-off so far this season He really feels like a 5th choice. At best.
8597,Newcastle,Dominating comfortably and concede first from a soft corner. It’s definitely Monday night. 
8598,Newcastle,WEEKLY REMINDER THAT WE NEED A FUCKING SET PIECE COACH 
8599,Newcastle,"They’ve been wank, if we could finish it be 5-1 Commentators waxing lyrical about them. Cant believe the shite coming out their mouths"
8600,Newcastle,"Second half shooting towards the Leazes? That calls for only one thing

A Schar thunder cunt "
8601,Newcastle,What the fuck is the point in VAR 
8602,Newcastle,"Leaving his boots there is a ridiculous take… he is trying to control the ball ffs! Who is this shit commentator? He literally dived. Realised he could flop like a fish and went for it, stupid fuck of a ref bought it."
8603,Newcastle,We get 1 and the floodgates open 
8604,Newcastle,Isaks leaving this hat trick really late like 
8605,Newcastle,"Remember when we were shite, like proper shite and you expected nowt, but every now and then we'd get a result and you'd be buzzing and we'd end the season in 14th or 15th and you'd feel absolutely nothing at the end of the season ? This is the complete opposite of that, I go into every game expecting us to win and be challenging for European football and we turn out performances like this and plenty of others this season, and I honestly don't know which is worse. This is way better. We have expectations now, sure, but we also have hope. 

We had no fucking hope before."
8606,Newcastle,"After 8 mins of great football, I would have bet my house on that goal "
8607,Newcastle,Kelly is shit isn't he very poor Even as a free he's a waste of money
8608,Newcastle,There is literally *no one* that could have improved this team other than Kelly and Guehi Remember that when we fail to improve our squad again next summer.
8609,Newcastle,West Ham are dogshit. That's what's so fucking annoying about this. 
8610,Newcastle,That's a pen 
8611,Newcastle,Tbh West Ham have defended well and caught us twice. They've done well here. 
8612,Newcastle,"Name a more iconic duo of Newcastle going into a game they should win, then fucking it right up. Can I introduce you to Tottenham Hotspur and the same?"
8613,Newcastle,"Offside or not, that finish was so, so cool. "
8614,Newcastle,Our attack vs their defence is the definition of a stoppable force meeting a moveable object. 
8615,Newcastle,Longstaff should have been yards to the right to receive that ball 
8616,Newcastle,This game is crying out for tonali’s brain 
8617,Newcastle,That has to be a pen.  What is the point of VAR. Ffs! 
8618,Newcastle,HOW IS GOOD FUCK IS THAT NOT A PENALTY!? 
8619,Newcastle,Lewis Hall can keep his head high regardless of the result here 
8620,Newcastle,Maybe this result will bring us back down to earth. People were saying we were gonna win like it’s a forgone conclusion lol. This is a wake up call that no game is a guarantee 
8621,Newcastle,"We’ve 3-4 players that are or will be top level, but for each one there is at least one another just happy to be in the squad.

Worse, several play in the same position. 

Everything looked great at 0-0 and dominating.

Cold Monday night, seats emptying, last 20 minutes. The difference gets stark. "
8622,Newcastle,Can’t even emphasise how little I care we had more of the ball. Teams let us have it because we don’t know what to do with it 
8623,Newcastle,"Howe has got this very wrong today. I almost feel like it’s arrogance, like just picking the same team from two weeks ago and turning up expecting a win at home to a poor team. There’s not been any imagination or quality.

And like clockwork Howe brings on Tonali after we’ve already lost the midfield battle. Really poor management. "
8624,Newcastle,This might be the strongest our bench has looked in no fewer than 18 months 
8625,Newcastle,Well why we’re starting Burn at CB is pretty evident now 
8626,Newcastle,Hahahaha the Mad Dog side-eye 
8627,Newcastle,Longstaff wiping out Willock there ffs 
8628,Newcastle,Get tonali on. Willock stinking up the joint today anyway 
8629,Newcastle,Longstaff going down by a gust of wind at this point 
8630,Newcastle,"He ripped his own shirt then cried about it wtf The commentator mentioned something about having a special shirt but didn’t really elaborate. Does he have an easy rip shirt to try cry for fouls? Bro, it's not his fault that every time Antonio tenses his pecs, his shirt explodes"
8631,Newcastle,So they waste time in added time and zero seconds whatsoever get added on? Make it make sense. 
8632,Newcastle,Tonali on for Willock please. Not seeing enough from him to justify him staying on. 
8633,Newcastle,"Very frustrating half where we just refused to score any of our clear cut chances

Still a winnable game "
8634,Newcastle,Got the ball fair and square. Co commentator can fuck off 
8635,Newcastle,Tino and Hall deserve better than this shite between them. 
8636,Newcastle,"How is grabbing by the neck and jumping from behind, not a penalty? "
8637,Newcastle,"I just can't believe this game man, it feels like the Brighton game. I just don't get how we're not slotting home some of these chances and then conceding all the half chances the opposition get. This is what drives me spare. How can another team have (let’s say) four chances and get two? And we can have four and get none? Did someone annoy a witch? If anything it's worse - West Ham have missed decent chances to be more than 2-0 up since they got the second goal It’s not like the Brighton game, we 100 percent deserve to lose this game"
8638,Newcastle,Wor flags are mint arnt they. Fucking tremendous 
8639,Newcastle,Fucking Joenaldinho there with the spin 
8640,Newcastle,Seems like we are collectively making the wrong decision every time 
8641,Newcastle,Willock is offering nowt. Get Barnes on for him & put Joelinton back in midfield. 
8642,Newcastle,"If we score, we win this by 2 or three, it's coming, just missing that final ball. Hall has been absolutely fantastic, Eddie completely vindicated in his management of him last season. "
8643,Newcastle,"What's worse than going into half time 1-0 down to West Ham ? Having to listen to Jamie fucking Carragher talk about it, that's what "
8644,Newcastle,Dan Burn I’m sorry 
8645,Newcastle,"It’s ok folks, Tonali is coming on at 60 mins as always "
8646,Newcastle,Can't score and conceded shocking goals? Newcastle is back 
8647,Newcastle,At least we’re done with the “we don’t lose when Longstaff starts” bollocks We've only lost once when Longstaff has started
8648,Newcastle,Whoever this commentator is is a fucking spastic 
8649,Newcastle,"Fuck me Gordon, been so poor again tonight "
8650,Newcastle,"Anthony Gordon has been frighteningly bad this season. Isn't scoring, barely involved in attacking play and hardly ever takes his man on. Needs to sort his head out or I genuinely wouldn't mind Almiron starting a few games. "
8651,Newcastle,Gordon has been absolutely shite 
8652,Newcastle,"At this point, just put Wilson on for Gordon. "
8653,Newcastle,Was about to say that this game is crying out for Jacob Murphy 
8654,Newcastle,"Stonewall surely, Wilson would have got that if not for the barge and hold "
8655,Newcastle,Even in rugby that's a foul. Fuck me.  
8656,Newcastle,What a honking decision that was. 
8657,Newcastle,"Honestly, if i was tonali i'd be fuming. Sit on the bench again behind longstaff, get on 2nd half and win the ball 10x more than anyone else and watch your teammates give up and produce consistently bad end product. Oh, he's got a transfer request in his drafts for sure. Should bench joelinton"
8658,Newcastle,*this* is the Newcastle I know and loathe... 
8659,Newcastle,"Don't want to hear any ""just one of those days"" excuses. This is a season long problem. 5 goals in 6 home matches. Our lack of goals is killing us. Think having to chase games constantly is what's killing us. Having to try get through 10 defenders after condeding first doesn't help us No idea how anyone can expect this team, this manager to win us anything. They crumble at the chance to go 6th for fuck sake. We relied on Isak and Gordon so much last season and they haven't been firing so far so we just don't have any threat 

Needed reinforcements in summer"
8660,Newcastle,Who would have thought pissing around with Guehi and not getting a CB would come back to bite us? 
8661,Newcastle,This team needs a kick up the arse. So inconsistent and seem to only turn up when they feel like it. How the hell they let that west ham team turn up and dictate play like that at St James under the lights is baffling. 
8662,Newcastle,Fucking again they advertise over the flag display but were meant to stand up and salute the TV when the kop’s speakers blast YNWA 
8663,Newcastle,Nobody attacking it defensively. First corner without Burn and someone should have been the one to step up. Poor after such a good start from the lads 
8664,Newcastle,"We have conceded the first goal in 8/12 games this season. Shocking really. 

Edit: At least this isn’t unusual territory Sloppy Especially when we seem to start well then end up conceding shite goals Fuck that’s quite the stat considering our table position."
8665,Newcastle,We've gone from looking like prime Brazil for 8 minutes to a poor 6th form side. Calm it down.  
8666,Newcastle,Whoever needs to hear this: we can still win this game 
8667,Newcastle,Isak giving me blue balls with these strikes missing the net 
8668,Newcastle,How is it 3 minutes man willock was down for 5 alone Paqueta had a bet on for 3
8669,Newcastle,Having to listen to Micheal Bridges for 90 minutes is more torturous then watching us try and score a goal at home. Wondered who that was on co-comms. Spends the whole game saying what a player should’ve done. Even when the play made was actually decent. Horrific to listen to. Isn't any worse than Martin Tyler insisting Isak join a bigger club or fawn over Soler playing tennis in his free time.
8670,Newcastle,We've got this in the bag. 4-1 win 
8671,Newcastle,"1.14 - 0.21 on xG

Have faith, we've been creating the openings. Forest take two "
8672,Newcastle,"It’s the same story as most games this season. We play good, but find ourselves behind anyway. This is the EIGHTH league game this season we have conceded first. You can only comeback so many times. Hopefully we do as we did again Forest, but this could very well be a Brighton 2.0.

Same issues like previously in the final third as well. We simply aren’t good enough in the final third too. Isak has scored a few goals recently, but is still missing too much. Gordon has 3 G+A this season. West Ham has made some mistakes, but we aren’t there to punish them. It’s weird, because I think we’re playing better and deserve to at least draw. But at the same time we feel so tame in the final third. "
8673,Newcastle,"It’s already abundantly clear how much we lack in attack with Longstaff and Joelinton as our CMs. Joelinton’s strength is not his passing and Longstaff is the least technical player in the team.

If you’re gonna take Willock off, you need to replace his technical ability in the middle by bringing on Tonali. Otherwise we’ve now gone back to the frustrating line up of the early parts of the season where we couldn’t break down teams with the final pass. "
8674,Newcastle,Why have we been so shite at taking our chances 
8675,Newcastle,Kelly poor for both goals 
8676,Newcastle,Miss you Sven 
8677,Newcastle,"Wins against Arsenal and the like mean very little when we can’t beat an absolutely abhorrent West Ham side at home. We didn't get Europe last season because we didn't beat the likes of Luton, Everton, Bournemouth or Forest (at home), this season shaping up the same. Turn up for the ""big"" teams throw away cheap points against the dross. West ham r a good team."
8678,Newcastle,Are we spurs? The squad is just a mid tableish team. Can beat anyone on our day but can also lose to anyone
8679,Newcastle,Arms all over him hahaha 
8680,Newcastle,WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK! How is that not a pen. 
8681,Newcastle,Mentality is a problem Scoreline too Hopefully Trippier solves that. Always thought he was a decent leader.
8682,Newcastle,That Saudi ping pong week break has paid dividends 
8683,Newcastle,"We've like actually just been really bad at football this half. First half was just unlucky if we're serious, but this 2nd half. Fucking hell. "
8684,Newcastle,Bring back international break 
8685,Newcastle,"I will never tire of seeing Joe absolutely smash the shit out of the ball with the Chelsea goalkeeper shitting himself so much at the prospect of getting in his way that he kindly dives out of the way for him. Only thing that really stuck in my mind for this match, what the fuck did he hit it that hard for hahaha. He hits the ball like he hates it, it's class"
8686,Newcastle,"Nobody marking Lascelles, that absolute gift for Big Joe. Chelsea's defending was absolutely dire. 

It was a great game though. Fingers crossed we can get a nice 4-1 win tonight against the Hammers. fingers crossed for a nicer 5-0 win"
8687,Newcastle,"TBF after the Stirling celebration, when big joe thunderfucked it in the net I am SHOOK he didnt give it a massive knee slide infront of the chelsea bench "
8688,Newcastle,Love that first goal. Seeing cucarella call for offside when he was the one who played Isak on with never get old 
8689,Newcastle,Slightly better day than yesterday that 
8690,Newcastle,"ON THIS DAY 2023:

Despite multiple injuries in the squad, and a damaging defeat away to Bournemouth before the international break, the Toon started strong against an expensively assembled Chelsea team.

The first goal came after some good pressing saw Sean Longstaff put the ball to seventeen year old Lewis Miley, who threaded a beautiful ball to Isak, who pulled out a wonderful turn and finish. 

Chelsea equalised with an admittedly superb free kick from Sterling, who then did a knee slide celebration in front of the Strawberry Corner, a decision he would soon rue.

The second came with a now trademark run down the left from Gordon, who then cut in, and put a beautiful cross in the box for captain Lascelles to head in.

More vintage Howe pressing saw Newcastle win the ball in the final third and saw Joelinton smash in a third. 

Reece James was sent off for a second bookable offence, as the Strawberry Corner sang songs to Sterling about not receiving a call up over the international break.

Gordon added the icing on the cake, as another run down the left, and cut in, saw him slot a perfect strike in the bottom corner and seal the win. "
8691,Newcastle,"Only thing that really stuck in my mind for this match, what the fuck did he hit it that hard for hahaha. A club source told me did this because 'he's a pua radge packet.'"
8692,Newcastle,"He hits the ball like he hates it, it's class "
8693,Newcastle,fingers crossed for a nicer 5-0 win 
8694,Newcastle,A club source told me did this because 'he's a pua radge packet.' 
8695,Newcastle,Jesus. Pawson officiating again? How they didn't file a grievance against that prick is beyond me. 
8696,Newcastle,trouble is west ham are so bad that they have to randomly put in a performance one of these days Won't be this far north
8697,Newcastle,10-0 to the mags We want 11 9-0 stay humble eh?
8698,Newcastle,Let’s smash these cunts they’re shite LETS
8699,Newcastle,"Can see a 3-1 win here. 

Just hope we don't concede first We conceded first against Forest and shagged them afterwards tbf"
8700,Newcastle,Isak hattrick pls 
8701,Newcastle,"On paper we should absolutely walk this one 

Which is exactly why I'm absolutely bricking it Most obvious Antonio dagger ever. Hopefully not."
8702,Newcastle,"Hope this isn’t one of those games where we go into it expecting to win, the atmosphere is average because of that, and we struggle to break them down leading to frustration letting our opponents grow into the game…

Or maybe we steamroll them 5-0, Isak hat-trick. "
8703,Newcastle,I know no player comes to sit on the bench but we seriously have to figure out how to give Tonali starts sooner rather than later I think he will work his way in eventually. But yes. I agree.
8704,Newcastle,"Has the potential to be a bit of a banana skin this game. Feel like everyone expects us to walk it, Newcastle and West Ham fans alike, and if we don't it's going to be straight back to hysterics for a significant part of the fan base after a good few weeks.

Hopefully we smash them. Longstaff to score a bicycle kick. "
8705,Newcastle,"Umm why are sky bleating on about Man Utd. Who cares.

Edit: City now. Jeez they can’t stop circle jerking about the top teams. I know. It is so annoying. Talk about the teams playing!"
8706,Newcastle,Managed to pick up 2 tickets on the NUFC website let's fucking gooooo 
8707,Newcastle,"4-1, Isak hattrick. Yes. You know it. I keep promising I’ll buy whoever gets a hattrick’s shirt. I could do with an Isak shirt!"
8708,Newcastle,West Ham low block means it's a case of who scores first. If we do then it'll be a battering. If they do then it won't be a pretty watch. West Ham fans have said their manger (I don’t want to cause a curse with whatever I would do to the spelling) plays a different set up each week. So hoping he decides low block is last weeks attempt!
8709,Newcastle,Won this game last season so need to win to keep that table of results vs last season at +1 
8710,Newcastle,International break and playing on a monday made me forget 
8711,Newcastle,"More stressed about this game than the arsenal one. Not sure if its cause we all think we are going to smash them, or because its Monday..or because days are getting darker...one of those things. Couple of pints should calm the nerves. Tonali will score tonight if you guys want to win some extra cash for the holidays It’s all of those things. Add in “Newcastle don’t know how to play against the lower level teams” and, we have been cursed “winning streak” why do people say these words!! We’re supposed to keep our hopes of a thrashing and an actual hattrick by our team to ourselves!"
8712,Newcastle,"Looks Like Wilson is back in the squad. NUFC posted his jersey on instgram, just in time to score against a team he apparently hates because he scores against them every year "
8713,Newcastle,Isak to bag a couple then Wilson to come on and get a brace himself 
8714,Newcastle,The pregame warm up is a review of man united. I mean... And touting isak to azzna
8715,Newcastle,"I actually hate sky sports. Why the fuck am I hearing analysis on City 20mins before the Newcastle West Ham game? Absolute joke In fairness to Scouse/manc sports, they tell you what they’re going to talk about on twitter before the game. That way you can avoid it"
8716,Newcastle,"Think this could be a slip up if we don’t come out fast and get on top of these.

If we can get in front early their heads will drop but adversely if they can keep us out they’ll fancy their chances to get something "
8717,Newcastle,"People predicting a big win, we are on a hot streak, international break should have given us time to rest and recover, yeah this is going to be one of those frustrating losses isn’t it? "
8718,Newcastle,"Howe really should drop Longstaff for this one. West Ham will surely turn up and give us all the ball, and say ""break us down"", and in those games Longstaff offers absolutely nothing. Won't happen, but Tonali should start this one. I've given up wondering whether Longstaff is starting/bench. It never makes sense to me. Aye, this game suits Tonali. Should. We know he won’t though 😔"
8719,Newcastle,"We were playing well before the break, and they wasn't judged on how there fans were reacting and the league table, I think they needed the break more than us and it will have helped them.

But I think we have momentum now which we haven't for a while, and at home are usually very good, and the one team we lost to in Brighton is a better side and we was unlucky to lose.

Perhaps be a bit closer than some are expecting, I'll go for 3-1, be close but Wilson comes off the bench late on to get his goal against West Ham and seal it for us. Wilson off the bench to seal it for us, before pulling up injured for four more months"
8720,Newcastle,"Betting exchanges are giving us a 66% chance of winning... great, now I'm bricking it "
8721,Newcastle,How did Krafth break his collarbone? Fighting crime. I heard it was in training but no more details. Tried to tackle big Joe?
8722,Newcastle,5-0 to keep the treble alive. 
8723,Newcastle,"I lost the toss and the family want to watch a film this evening. Load of my balls.

8724,Newcastle,Does anyone think Tyler Dibling would be a great signing for right wing? You spelt Willy Gnonto wrong
8725,Newcastle,"Hey OP, please auto sort by new. "
8726,Newcastle,3-2 Mags with Big Joe and Little joe bagging one each (a man can dream) Are you a West Ham fan dreaming of scoring two goals at Fortress St. James'?
8727,Newcastle,"Monday night football absolutely kills the momentum and joy of the result, hoping the lads can pick up from their previous form and that Kelly has a good game too. "
8728,Newcastle,"Demolition written all over it.

7-0 "
8729,Newcastle,"Isak with 3, the Joes for one each, and a brace for Pope. One throw from the other box and one bend-it-like-beckham howler from the halfline

(Bruno will spinning back elbow anyone trying to press him)"
8730,Newcastle,Thought we were away for some reason. Feeling alot more confident now that we're at home.... but then it's the confidence that will come back to haunt you isn't it 
8731,Newcastle,"Please don't fuck it up don't fuck it up.....

It's these games where I'm worried the most. Take deep breaths and think of Isak"
8732,Newcastle,Antonio loves one against us Yeah but Eddie Howe knows that
8733,Newcastle,"How we feeling about no Burn? Not great to be honest, he’s been a bit of a rock Looking forward to seeing how Kelly does, in theory he’s a more technical and quicker version of Burn, but he’ll be rusty and has mainly played at LB so far. Happy. Burn has exceeded expectations and should be a key squad player. But Kelly is far better on the ball and with more pace and mobility. Both games he's played at LCB he's been great. Long overdue PL start."
8734,Newcastle,Kelly for Burn is the only change. Wilson/Tripps on the bench 
8735,Newcastle,"Please no injury to a CB today, we have no cover on the bench.  Joelinton would have to play there lol Don’t worry he’s world class everywhere/anywhere on the pitch except centre foward ofc"
8736,Newcastle,Wtf! Ffs! 
8737,Newcastle,Wtf!!! 🤬 
8738,Newcastle,"When we win tonight, we’ll only be 2 points off second place Delete"
8739,Newcastle,"Seriously worried Tonali might leave because of this. 

Guy starts for Italy but can't get more than 30 minutes. It's a luxury to have but I don't see Howe changing this team if we keep winning.

And of course winning is the no.1 priority but you can't tell me we can't win with Tonali? You mean the Tonali that we paid to sit on the sidelines after his gambling ban? The one we supported, counselled and coached through the worst year of his career? I think after what we did for him and the run of form we've had with him coming off the bench, we should be ok for a while"
8740,Newcastle,Won't be this far north 
8741,Newcastle,We want 11 
8742,Newcastle,9-0 stay humble eh? 
8743,Newcastle,LETS SMASH
8744,Newcastle,We conceded first against Forest and shagged them afterwards tbf True and came back from 1-3 down to West Ham last season. I'd just like to not be angry on a Monday night
8745,Newcastle,Most obvious Antonio dagger ever. Hopefully not. 
8746,Newcastle,I think he will work his way in eventually. But yes. I agree. 
8747,Newcastle,I know. It is so annoying. Talk about the teams playing! 
8748,Newcastle,I keep promising I’ll buy whoever gets a hattrick’s shirt. I could do with an Isak shirt! 
8749,Newcastle,West Ham fans have said their manger (I don’t want to cause a curse with whatever I would do to the spelling) plays a different set up each week. So hoping he decides low block is last weeks attempt! 
8750,Newcastle,"It’s all of those things. Add in “Newcastle don’t know how to play against the lower level teams” and, we have been cursed “winning streak” why do people say these words!! We’re supposed to keep our hopes of a thrashing and an actual hattrick by our team to ourselves! "
8751,Newcastle,And touting isak to azzna 
8752,Newcastle,"In fairness to Scouse/manc sports, they tell you what they’re going to talk about on twitter before the game. That way you can avoid it "
8753,Newcastle,"I've given up wondering whether Longstaff is starting/bench. It never makes sense to me. Alex on the True Faith podcast made a very good point the other week saying that Longstaff has to play himself out of the team, he's never dropped for tactical reasons, he's only dropped when his performances dip to a level that Howe has no choice (and then usually is reinstalled after a few weeks away), which seems accurate to me."
8754,Newcastle,"Aye, this game suits Tonali. "
8755,Newcastle,Should. We know he won’t though 😔 
8756,Newcastle,"Wilson off the bench to seal it for us, before pulling up injured for four more months "
8757,Newcastle,Fighting crime. 
8758,Newcastle,I heard it was in training but no more details. Tried to tackle big Joe? Maybe big Joe gave Krafth a pat on the back and just forgot how strong he is

8765,Newcastle,Yeah but Eddie Howe knows that Yeah but Antonio knows that Eddie Howe knows that We played a high line giving West Ham and Antonio the freedom of SJP for an hour in March so not quite sure Howe knew that.
8766,Newcastle,"Not great to be honest, he’s been a bit of a rock "

Just watched the full match replay, some very average performances.  No card for Schar so back to our normal partnership.  Lloyd Kelly really didn't take his chance today, Dan Burn will be straight back in and deservedly so.  West Ham popped it about in the second half and we really struggled to create clear cut chances - I don't like 4-4-2 get it wide and get it into the mixer football, there's a reason why top teams don't play in this way, yet Eddie Howe resorts to it when we are down.  Would like to see us boss the midfield by adding an extra number in there, potentially a 4-3-2-1 system or 4-3-1-2."

8795,Newcastle,"Did they put Scott Parker at Park Lane just for the lame pun? Should have put him as Scott (free) parking, and had Jackie Milburn up front with Shearer. I got this as a bairn and thought it was because at the time Scott Parker was our captain, I remember thinking it was an odd choice because I’m pretty sure he was gone a few months after and it already seemed redundant. Maybe I was too young and ignorant to recognise the Park Lane pun, though that might be because it’s a shite pun. It should be Wor Jackie"
8796,Newcastle,Emre needs to disappear off that board Michael Owen too Maybe for a re-release updated to take into account the last 20ish years
8797,Newcastle,Cross out the word jail and replace with S*nderland Id pay more than £200 to get out of Sunderland
8798,Newcastle,"I used to have that game.
Even at the time I felt like there was too many current players on it, and it was just going to age badly. "
8799,Newcastle,"Bloody hell forgot about this

... or indeed that I have it somewhere "
8800,Newcastle,Ive got a version with Marcelino on it next to the sick bay 
8801,Newcastle,"Looks good, but then I saw Emre there. "
8802,Newcastle,Does this come with special PSR rules that keep players who are doing well at arbitrary point in time on top. 
8803,Newcastle,Pav is way better than Whitechapel. 
8804,Newcastle,I get why there are a couple of players on there as it obviously came out in the early 00s but what the hell is John Anderson doing on there?

8820,Newcastle,"Liverpool haven't slipped up yet. They're visiting St James a week Wednesday though. That'll be a fucking tasty occasion Glad you have some optimism. After 30 years of hurt I’ve learned to forget about getting any points when Liverpool are the opposition. Proper bogey team for us. 2’ Newcastle 0-1 Liverpool (Salah) Well, they slipped up v Forest. Even though they've started better, I'm less terrified of this Liverpool than Klopp's best sides (who, ironically, we had a fairly good home record against, considering our position at the time)."
8821,Newcastle,"Obligatory weekly Isak rumour out the way this week nice and early at least... [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/clydl5y8ww1o) This Isak to Arsenal link is so boring now It's always either TeamTalk of Football Insider that spout this bollocks. They're obsessed. Luckily for us, they've also got negative credibility. Isak will sign a new contract.  Slow news day."
8822,Newcastle,"one of my favourite things about going into town is that St. James' is perched right on top of it. so many routes into town that you can't help but see it

hope that never changes "
8823,Newcastle,"I’m going to make a bold call: if we don’t secure Europe this year, it might be time for Howe to go. Games like yesterday are must-wins if we want to keep our European hopes alive. Without that, our chances of holding onto players like Isak, already slim, will disappear fast. It’s frustrating because we have the potential, but performances like this just aren’t good enough. Not really a bold call, it's pretty widely believed that if we don't make Europe, Howe will be sacked. That'll be two seasons without Europe, and both Mitchell and Eales have made it publically known that the internal club expectation/target is European qualification. Seems almost a given that no Europe means that Howe is sacked. I don't think that's a bold call whatsoever. Rightly or wrongly they're targeting Europe this year (most likely at least EL). Depending on how conversations for Jan go and then what we do in Jan itself will feed into how much slack Eddie has left. I would like to think our decision-makers are able to hold a bit more nuance that Europe = Howe stays, no Europe = sack. If we get to the end of the season and we're still seeing the same as we do now, with a general flatness and inability to put together consistent results, then you can probably make a good case for him losing his job. It would probably be harsh, considering the people above him's mismanagement destabilised the team over the summer and then failed in bringing anyone in but them's the breaks.

The big worry is that a lot of players are underperforming currently and just not looking close to their best. The players who should be taking leadership driving the team forward, like Bruno, Isak, Gordon and Joelinton (who have all been given new contracts, or hope to be) simply aren't looking very good, even in parts of their game that is solely on them and not due to how we or the opposition set up.

But whether Howe stays or goes, the main thing is that we're in an almightily healthier position than when he took over and that's probably the most you can ask from a manager."
8824,Newcastle,Tripps posting on insta about the game tonight. In the squad? Think he does this every game day. Must be!
8825,Newcastle,"Once a team decides they're parking the bus against us, we've got absolutely nothing. No craft, no creativity, we just pass it around their box for 90 minutes, back and forth, left to right then left again, looking for openings that will never come. We look entirely baffled and bereft of ideas, even against sides as defensively poor as west ham. To lose is one thing, but to look so toothless, at home, against that opposition, with the squad we have? Nowhere near good enough.  I don’t think West Ham parked the bus until about the 75th minute though. 

They were giving up a lot of space behind the defence that we failed to take advantage of. I was shocked that they didn’t park the bus after going 1-nil up. 

Generally they defended their 6 yard box really well but I’m not sure I’d say they parked the bus at all. Which makes the game even more of a disappointment to me."
8826,Newcastle,"Just seen Brighton are willing to loan out Evan Ferguson for some game time. 

Don’t think they’ll loan to us but he looked a canny player a year or so ago, still only young as well. The teams getting mentioned with signing him are the relegation threatened ones. Surely he’s above their level? We should be using players getting Howe’d as an advert for clubs looking to send talents on loan tbh 

Getting Howe’d being the opposite of getting Bruce’d"
8827,Newcastle,Whens Botman back? Not soon enough.
8828,Newcastle,"Salah? Mad that Liverpool have let it get to this with him. Hes saying he hasn’t received an offer He'd take us to the next level. Gordon, Isak and Salah. Fucking drool. It'll never happen though. If he leaves Liverpool, he'll leave England. You think we can spunk £500,000 a week on his wages???"
8829,Newcastle,"Anyone else nervous for tonight? I am.  Tell me something to comfort me please. West Ham have beaten us once in the last 10 H2Hs. We are coming into form with a formation that seems to be clicking. They are in some pretty shambolic form with only a fairly controversial win against an also shite Man Reds. We are also playing at SJP.

JLo is their manager. We'll be reet."
8830,Newcastle,"Question for the Geordies who moved away, particularly abroad. Did you feel your relationship with the club change? Living in Newcastle, the club permeates everything, and is a huge part of the city. Living somewhere where 90% have never heard of Newcastle or really care about football, it's definitely become less at the forefront of my mind. It's more something linking me back to my home. I still watch games when I can, but 4am kickoffs are a no-go if I want a full night's sleep. Mine got stronger. BUT. I wasn’t Newcastle based so I’m probably not who you are really aiming the question at. 

When I lived in the U.K. I would get to see maybe 4 games per season in person. And the rest of the time was at the mercy of Sky or sailing the “high seas”

Now I’m in Canada I get to watch every game. I think I’ve missed 2 in the past 3 years."
8831,Newcastle,"So many fans on that SJP debate thread are completely blind to why we may move from SJP. 

It's not because its old, its not because its not good enough, its purely to fulfil our aims of reaching the pinnacle of football. 

Seen some fans say lets build a world class team before we move (which is impossible given our ffp breaches) or reference West Ham/Tottenham. Tottenham's stadium is wonderful and a terrible example. Just to reference I know plenty of Tottenham fans and hardly any are disappointed they moved. West Ham are in an Olympic stadium, one ours wont be. It seems like our fans are using two incorrect plausibilities to fit their narrative.

We all know if we are to reach the top PSR is obviously the biggest hurdle, a new stadium enables huge PSR leaps (and more sponsorships/concerts/hospitality etc) allowing us to grow. We can't just keep complaining the rules are unfair, we need to find a way around it.

It just seems like at the moment our fans have a real nostalgia problem, I know it will be hard to move on a place we all have great memories of, but the change is for the better. Also what harm would it be to get an extra 15000 toon fans each week at a new stadium, would only improve the atmosphere. I think we should build a levitating arena, like Bowsers flying Castle. That be intimidating for the other teams coming to play here! I think for me (and most other fans) the real red line will be the location. It just has to be in the city center. I think if they can't deliver that, the fanbase will be overwhelming against a new stadium. If they can get a new ground in the city, the opposition will mostly be ST holders who already have there's and so would rather stay as the move doesn't do much for them personally in terms of getting access to the ground. how did chelsea reach the absolute pinnacle of domestic and european football with only 40k in stamford bridge?"
8832,Newcastle,">However, it is understood Newcastle are unlikely to make any signings in the upcoming transfer window unless other players leave the club. [Sky Sports](https://www.skysports.com/transfer-centre). 

Assuming the info is true (which I acknowledge isn't a given), really does make me wonder where we'd be had we managed to get Guehi in the summer. Probably a blessing Palace dug their heels in and we walked away. Sold the stadium, sold the badge space on our shirt to a sponsor, melted down the shearer statue to sell the metal - all must be sacrificed for our 200  million Guehi bid According to Craig Hope, we would have had to make some sales in January if we had bought Guehi, albeit he suggested it wasn't a huge amount we would have needed to generate. 

That Sky link is probably correct, Hope and Mark Douglas have both suggested we will need to sell if we want to buy in January."
8833,Newcastle,Book NUFC showing tickets available then going into a blank white screen when you click to see them. Class 
8834,Newcastle,"After yesterday I really think we need competition for Isak. He has some amazing qualities but I find it frustrating when he is standing on the left wing instead of playing through the middle and helping to compact a defence for our wingers to have space out wide. I also find his press inconsistent often allows teams to play through. 

Seen rumours Kolo Muani may be available for a loan and I think it would be a good option. Also Wilsons return hopefully sparks more fire in Isak to produce better. 

I will take my downvotes now. I'm not sure if we're getting Isak involved in the game enough though since it's not just him that's playing worse than he did last season, many others are as well. I wonder how his progressive passes received, touches in the box, etc stats compares?

But yes, no matter how good he is we need competition, though not sure if Muani is a realistic option if PSG want his wages covered."
8835,Newcastle,"""Oh no, we suck again"" "
8836,Newcastle,"Apparently Brighton have made Evan Ferguson available on loan [according to the Telegraph ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/26/brighton-evan-ferguson-loan-january-transfer-window/)

I think he'd make an excellent backup striker to Isak at least for the rest of the season - and it would give us the freedom to move Wilson on in January without worrying about paying for his replacement Remember when he scored a hattrick against us and the talk was Chelsea were going to sign him, but Brighton wanted £100m? Only if we have an option to buy. Otherwise we’re way past developing other club’s youngsters just because we’re too cheap to sign our own.

At the end of the day, we need a real backup to Isak. We can’t keep kicking the can down the road. If Ferguson isn’t good enough for Brighton then he isn’t good enough for us. If it’s just a loan to get him fit and going then I don’t see the benefit for us in the long term, it’s only serving to strengthen Brighton and we’ve done that enough already. Why would Brighton send their youngster who can't get game time to be a backup striker to Isak? He would go somewhere to be guaranteed games and that ain't us."
8837,Newcastle,How's miggy smiles doing? 
8838,Newcastle,"How much is PSR actually impacting us at this point and how much is our owners/leadership claiming issues so as not to be bent over the barrel? A lot. I know people want to pretend otherwise and will think our bids for Guehi in the summer means we've got lots of spending room. But the simple fact is that our amortisation/wages and other expenses have only increased, we've not added any significant revenue other than SELA & Adidas and we're incapable of selling players outside of PSR fiddle deals. If the rules change to a squad cost ratio system in the summer, our financial constraints will get even tighter."
8839,Newcastle,"You know if I hated /r/nufc as much as a couple of regular users on this sub endlessly claim to, I'd probably stop coming around so much. Just an idea! "
8840,Newcastle,"If Kelly is supposed to be the answer, what was the original question? 🤣 Answer to Burn I still think he probably is given what we've got to choose from. He had a stinker, but he's hardly had a chance in the team (literally his first league start at LCB) and Burns had plenty of consistent games even when he's struggled. But we need Botman back badly as none of our CB's are performing."
8841,Newcastle,"Glad you have some optimism. After 30 years of hurt I’ve learned to forget about getting any points when Liverpool are the opposition. Proper bogey team for us. iirc they're the one PL team we haven't beaten since the takeover.

*""I'd love it if we beat them...""* Didn't say we'd win. Said it'll be tasty. But I do think we'll win. Liverpool will have a sticky patch at some point. Why not on Tyneside"

8855,Newcastle,"Mad that Liverpool have let it get to this with him. Hes saying he hasn’t received an offer They've got themselves into an almighty pickle. I think they'd really have hoped by now that one of their younger forward options would have asserted themselves more as a creative fulcrum, but instead things have moved further and further to being Salah-dependent. 

They're also in big trouble that TAA and VVD are approaching the ends of their contracts and they know that any pay rise they give to Salah will be requested by those other two. A controlled wage structure is the backbone of FFP compliance and giving into Salah's demands (with the knock-on effects on other salary negotiations) is the kind of thing that stops you from reinvesting."
8856,Newcastle,"He'd take us to the next level. Gordon, Isak and Salah. Fucking drool. It'll never happen though. If he leaves Liverpool, he'll leave England. "
8857,Newcastle,"You think we can spunk £500,000 a week on his wages??? Aramco sponsorship coming through :copium: He's been tipped for Saudi anyway. I'm sure he wouldn't mind a bit extra on his tax-free wages from 2026 in exchange for a season here. 


Never going to happen, but God that would be some front three"
8858,Newcastle,"West Ham have beaten us once in the last 10 H2Hs. We are coming into form with a formation that seems to be clicking. They are in some pretty shambolic form with only a fairly controversial win against an also shite Man Reds. We are also playing at SJP.

JLo is their manager. We'll be reet. "
8859,Newcastle,"Mine got stronger. BUT. I wasn’t Newcastle based so I’m probably not who you are really aiming the question at. 

When I lived in the U.K. I would get to see maybe 4 games per season in person. And the rest of the time was at the mercy of Sky or sailing the “high seas”

Now I’m in Canada I get to watch every game. I think I’ve missed 2 in the past 3 years. "
8860,Newcastle,"I think we should build a levitating arena, like Bowsers flying Castle. That be intimidating for the other teams coming to play here! Should definitely float that idea"
8861,Newcastle,"I think for me (and most other fans) the real red line will be the location. It just has to be in the city center. I think if they can't deliver that, the fanbase will be overwhelming against a new stadium. If they can get a new ground in the city, the opposition will mostly be ST holders who already have there's and so would rather stay as the move doesn't do much for them personally in terms of getting access to the ground. We have all the money. It's got to be in Leazes park. Surely we can throw bags of cash at the council with the caviate that we make the existing stadium into a public park (and improve the amenities of the rest of Leazes park).


This for me is the only way you're going to please the majority of people. We cannot refit the the current stadium. It just won't be viable or have the necessary number of additional seats to justify the price.


We can't move it out of the city centre. It means too much to Newcastle. 


This is the only way it will work AND still allow us to play at St James park while a new stadium gets built."
8862,Newcastle,"how did chelsea reach the absolute pinnacle of domestic and european football with only 40k in stamford bridge? They did it before FFP Because they had no FFP to deal with. Because the cartel rules weren't in place to stop them from spending billions of pounds of Russian oligarchy money. You just gonna casually ignore the literal Billions that they have spent to get where they are? 

They'd have a fancy new stadium too if it wasn't for the fact that they have an awkward situation with being in the rich part of London and having a name legally tied to the current stadium location. Well they were able to spend whatever they wanted regardless of matchday revenue when they were growing post-takeover. The fact is, with the PSR rules in place now, they've been more and more desperate to move out of Stamford Bridge as it is a big financial constraint on them."
8863,Newcastle,"Sold the stadium, sold the badge space on our shirt to a sponsor, melted down the shearer statue to sell the metal - all must be sacrificed for our 200  million Guehi bid "
8864,Newcastle,"According to Craig Hope, we would have had to make some sales in January if we had bought Guehi, albeit he suggested it wasn't a huge amount we would have needed to generate. 

That Sky link is probably correct, Hope and Mark Douglas have both suggested we will need to sell if we want to buy in January. "
8865,Newcastle,"I'm not sure if we're getting Isak involved in the game enough though since it's not just him that's playing worse than he did last season, many others are as well. I wonder how his progressive passes received, touches in the box, etc stats compares?

But yes, no matter how good he is we need competition, though not sure if Muani is a realistic option if PSG want his wages covered. I struggle to see that a) we would want Muani in on loan if Wilson and Osula are still around and b) if Muani wants to come to play second fiddle to Isak. He won't be guaranteed game time and that won't suit anyone."
8866,Newcastle,"Remember when he scored a hattrick against us and the talk was Chelsea were going to sign him, but Brighton wanted £100m? "
8867,Newcastle,"Only if we have an option to buy. Otherwise we’re way past developing other club’s youngsters just because we’re too cheap to sign our own.

At the end of the day, we need a real backup to Isak. We can’t keep kicking the can down the road. If Ferguson isn’t good enough for Brighton then he isn’t good enough for us. If it’s just a loan to get him fit and going then I don’t see the benefit for us in the long term, it’s only serving to strengthen Brighton and we’ve done that enough already. I e gotta be honest. I think the Ferguson hype is way overboard. He had a good run of like 4 games and has barely played since. Under De Zerbi AND Hurtzeler he has been second fiddle to a middle aged Welbeck and not just second fiddle but like barely gets more minutes than Osula. That probably says he’s not the wonderkid promised It doesn't even benefit Brighton though. He would just be swapping one bench for another but need to move to another end of the country in order to do so!"
8868,Newcastle,Why would Brighton send their youngster who can't get game time to be a backup striker to Isak? He would go somewhere to be guaranteed games and that ain't us. 
8869,Newcastle,"A lot. I know people want to pretend otherwise and will think our bids for Guehi in the summer means we've got lots of spending room. But the simple fact is that our amortisation/wages and other expenses have only increased, we've not added any significant revenue other than SELA & Adidas and we're incapable of selling players outside of PSR fiddle deals. If the rules change to a squad cost ratio system in the summer, our financial constraints will get even tighter. Meanwhile for over 3 years we haven't even bothered to monetize our training kit sponsor and other avenues for commercilization we could have exploited.

It's honestly getting to a critical tipping point imo. 

If PiF are telling the truth in their claims they want NUFC to challenge for titles, and be the next 'big' club & something has to change. 

We get 2 or 3 good results then we get thumped by mediocre teams. We put in 1 good display, and then 2 or 3 games in a row our team just looks like they cannot be arsed about the result. 

If it doesn't change, players like Isak will inevitably leave, because currently we are a mid table team and nothing more."
8870,Newcastle,"Answer to Burn I still think he probably is given what we've got to choose from. He had a stinker, but he's hardly had a chance in the team (literally his first league start at LCB) and Burns had plenty of consistent games even when he's struggled. But we need Botman back badly as none of our CB's are performing. "
8871,Newcastle,"iirc they're the one PL team we haven't beaten since the takeover.

*""I'd love it if we beat them...""* "
8872,Newcastle,"Didn't say we'd win. Said it'll be tasty. But I do think we'll win. Liverpool will have a sticky patch at some point. Why not on Tyneside Exactly, it's one of those 'written in the stars' moments that usually go against us. It's about time we had one go our way."
8873,Newcastle,"Trophy would save him I'm not sure. I think a Carabao Cup would matter a lot more to the fans than the owners. The Europa League is worth what like 10x more (?) than a Carabao Cup win in terms of income. FA Cup has more prestige I suppose, but really do think it's Europe or bust for Howe this season. If this really is a ""sports washing"" project, the Saudis will want to be among the big boys in Europe, not winning the Energy Drink Trophy and finishing in midtable. 

(obviously aware cup win comes with Europe place, but think if we're like 10th and get Conference from Carabao, he'd still be sacked. Will also say, I desperately want Eddie Howe to work out longterm here, so hope to be wrong)"
8874,Newcastle,"Alexa, play Newcastle’s In The Sky by Ian Van Dahl "
8875,Newcastle,"They've got themselves into an almighty pickle. I think they'd really have hoped by now that one of their younger forward options would have asserted themselves more as a creative fulcrum, but instead things have moved further and further to being Salah-dependent.

As for the salary he is on £220k so we could afford a % of it I think. 

Osula not getting any game time and how long do we have Wilson before he picks up another knock? I stopped counting on Wilson a long time ago. Not blaming him or anything, I'm sure he's trying his best to be fit and available but he hardly ever is when we need him these days. I'm not sure about Osula either, I get why we signed him but he's also not someone Howe trusts to get us back into a game in the league let alone start a match."
8886,Newcastle,"I e gotta be honest. I think the Ferguson hype is way overboard. He had a good run of like 4 games and has barely played since. Under De Zerbi AND Hurtzeler he has been second fiddle to a middle aged Welbeck and not just second fiddle but like barely gets more minutes than Osula. That probably says he’s not the wonderkid promised Yea considering a quarter of his goals came in that one game against us, it’s excessive. But he is good and he’s still only 20. He could easily develop and become a beast, he’s shown his potential. So a loan is the right idea for them but not for us, unless we could sign him permanently as a rotation for Isak. I’d be cool with that. But not at 60m."
8887,Newcastle,It doesn't even benefit Brighton though. He would just be swapping one bench for another but need to move to another end of the country in order to do so!

They sound more bullish about VVD staying for at least another year but I think there's a very real concern TAA has had his head turned and won't sign a new contract to go to Real Madrid.
8892,Newcastle,Maybe like one of those “floating coffee tables” 
8893,Newcastle,"what's that got to do with the capacity of their stadium? Because we need the bigger stadium to generate the commercial revenue to invest more. 

Chelsea were allowed a blank check from their Russian sugar daddy. That’s why it’s relevant.

Unless your point is how did they reach the pinnacle when they are a nothing club that had ni fans pre-2000"

Osula not getting any game time and how long do we have Wilson before he picks up another knock? Well maybe, but we'd have to get rid of Almiron or Murphy to make squad room if he's anticipated to play on the right. Plus, there's basically no chance of making the move permanent as the player won't take a pay cut to play here long-term.

I think PSG could find takers who would be willing to pay more of that salary or at least see it being more worthwhile him staying, plus he'll likely want some kind of European competition. Even with Wilson getting injured, you're throwing money away if you basically decide he won't play ever because you have Kolo Muani."
8896,Newcastle,"I stopped counting on Wilson a long time ago. Not blaming him or anything, I'm sure he's trying his best to be fit and available but he hardly ever is when we need him these days.

Because you're saying that you are happy for him to never play again, at which point you may as well just have gotten his wages off the books."

8900,Newcastle,"Well maybe, but we'd have to get rid of Almiron or Murphy to make squad room if he's anticipated to play on the right. Plus, there's basically no chance of making the move permanent as the player won't take a pay cut to play here long-term.

Even with Wilson getting injured, you're throwing money away if you basically decide he won't play ever because you have Kolo Muani. Happily get rid of Almiron at this point. I love him but he really isn’t good enough anymore and the purple patch from 2 years ago is no longer enough to carry him. 

I think if we want Europe though a player like him can get us there or at least shows a willingness to do something to get there. 

Personally if we sign quality players on loan to achieve Europe and fail I would at least be able to say we did try something. And if we achieve it the cost would be worth it. 

None of our opinions change anything but, as a fan, I would want to see the club flex and risk a bit more."

Because you're saying that you are happy for him to never play again, at which point you may as well just have gotten his wages off the books. Agreed, we should've sold Wilson while he still had value and time on his contract but he's into his last year and no one's going to give us anything for him. It's mismanagement but if we go on a good run between now and Jan, this season could still be a very successful one. If Wilson's injured and Osula hasn't progressed (both likely scenarios) then another reliable option upfront could help us accomplish our goals."

Well lots of quality players would help us get Europe, but there aren't many who would trade what they have to get a team into European competition that they won't then be involved in. Unfortunately, the situation we're in means getting players to buy into the long-term project and the promise that, soon enough, we'll be regularly up there in the table. That's what Botman, Isak and Bruno were sold and we'll likely need to do it again."

8906,Newcastle,Its a tough one. The way we were playing its unlikely we were getting back into it and it is a monday night with people having work and school tommorow (looks like family section). But leaving early isnt a good look for us and should still be behind the team until the end. 
8907,Newcastle,Tbf it was pretty bad towards the end. I personally never leave but dont blame them 
8908,Newcastle,"Honestly think you'll see the same thing at any ground in the country in that situation, I've seen plenty of season ticket holders get out early when the result is bad to beat the crowds "
8909,Newcastle,"Fucking embarrassing display that match was, don't blame em. "
8910,Newcastle,"I think more people would have stayed if it looked like there was any hope of getting a late goal, but we showed no signs of that at all. "
8911,Newcastle,"85th minute on a Monday night. If the players can’t be arsed why should the fee paying fans be arsed. 

They were good all night until that point too "
8912,Newcastle,"Just got back, yea, don’t blame people too, we weren’t absolutely terrible just very meh "
8913,Newcastle,Yes definitely not the twenty thousand other fans that got rejected on the ballot for the 5th time 
8914,Newcastle,"Glad they left early was dead quiet for me at the end 

On a serious note people missed 15-20 mins of the game vs Arsenal due to long half time breaks and leaving early what did you expect when we weren’t playing well?

And a good number of those leaving early are STH’s "
8915,Newcastle,"Last train back to St Pancras was 2135 tbf. Not my cup of tea personally, but midweek fixture in November, and they still won't be getting home till nearly 2am if they're inaide the m25. Can't blame them too much. "
8916,Newcastle,"I’m a firm believer in not judging people on your own standards. You have noidea of peoples situations.; It’s Monday night, long journey home, work early tomorrow, kids etc. Hey at least they showed up to the game ! To be honest I turned off the TV after the second goal because I was fuming lmao. "
8917,Newcastle,I usually stay but left at 85 tonight 
8918,Newcastle,"crowd was poor tonight throughout. team played shit but there wasn't that much genuine support in the grounds. Started off alright, then all the players just stood and watched as a free header went in and it killed the mood for a bit. But I think for there to be an atmosphere for the full 90 which is a big ask they need to see something from the players, there was no passion, no movement, no desire at all from the pitch. A lot seem to forgot they feed off each other both the fans and the players, and the players also have to sometimes kick start the fans by doing literally anything which was also lacking today."
8919,Newcastle,95% of the stadium was silent tonight. 
8920,Newcastle,I always leave on 85 minutes just so I can get the fuck out of town before gridlock. Sometimes I hate it. Tonight was not one of those nights. 
8921,Newcastle,Can’t really have a go at fans for leaving early when it’s been a shite performance especially when the weather is horrible. They’ve paid their money they can go when they please. 
8922,Newcastle,Don't blame them for leaving. But tbh our fans have been shite for a long time now. Atmosphere at SJP is non-existent outside of like three select fixtures. I say this as someone who attends every home game. 
8923,Newcastle,What reason did they have to stay? The players looked like they couldn’t care less. 
8924,Newcastle,"No excuses leaving early like that’s fkn pathetic - school and work aren’t excuses either 

Embarassing "
8925,Newcastle,"What do you mean leaving St James Park? Sorry, I'm American. "
8926,Newcastle,"I knew this was gonna be a divisive post, but all I've heard is how we need to move away from sjp to allow more balloters get tickets.

I know it isn't every balloter leaving early, and I know a shit load of STHers would've left early too. But those thousands that left level 7 looking like that, left between 75 and 80 minutes, we were still in the game, sjp should've been roaring the team on, one goal at that point and we're back in the game. 

First poor performance in ages and people are rushing to the exits. We were not in that game. First half we dominated the majority, but as usual don’t stick our chances away against the worst teams and it bites us. 2nd half was a shocking display, it was as if they all decided let’s lump it long and hope we catch their defence out. It was frustrating watching how much we rushed. A full half wasted on ridiculous balls that were never going to result in a goal. It feels like a while since we lost because of internationals but the reality is we had 3 good games and now we’ve reverted back to type, this is the type of performance we’ve been putting in all season."

8930,Newcastle,They’ll be more worried than we are  They defo are. Our fans have quite a good relationship with theirs on twitter and they’ve been making jokes about how we’re gonna thrash them 8-0 all week
8931,Newcastle,"8pm at home. Them travelling up from London.

I feel they will be more worried than we are.

We are strong right now and coming off the back of a good win v forest.

I'm optimistic. "
8932,Newcastle,Win here and we're one point off third. Got to pick up the three points. 
8933,Newcastle,"Night game under the floodlights at St James, so the atmosphere will be great. International players on a high from a successful break - impressive England starts for Gordon, Hall and Tino, goals for Tonali and Isak, and the rest of the squad with the warm weather training and on a winning streak. The squad should be going into this one full of confidence.

West Ham seem to be in a bit of a rut too, with rumours doing the rounds of Lopetegui being given the boot. Kudus is suspended and (redacted) doesn't seem to be the player he once was. 

We should be feeling confident for all 3 points. Gordon scored too Didn’t know Kudus is suspended - that’s good news"
8934,Newcastle,Must win game imo. 
8935,Newcastle,"These are the games that worry me more. Should win but then ultimately end up playing shit and probably losing. 

Definitely a must win though so we can keep up with the pack for top 4/5 Life as a Newcastle fan. Play a team at the bottom of the table and you’re bricking it more than a team at the top 😂"
8936,Newcastle,"Very confident, we have just beaten Chelsea, Arsenal and Forest in a row, their last 3 games were 0-0 at home to Everton, 3-0 defeat at Forest and 2-1 win at home to Man U (lol)

Kudus is arguably their best player, maybe apart from Bowen, and he’s suspended. They’re reportedly already looking at new managers so mood can’t be great. Whereas mood in our camp will be buoyant and Isak is in hot form. 

Will caveat with saying that obviously nothing can be taken for granted in this league, but anything other than a win would be a huge disappointment and a step backwards. "
8937,Newcastle,"Need to be hammering these - No Kudus, out of form players and a manager under pressure - plus we need a game where we put a few in to get our confidence growing Bowen will have a spring in his step though. Hopefully he’s the only one."
8938,Newcastle,"Yearly Callum Wilson goal against West Ham, I can feel it. Followed by the traditional 2 months out with a knock and/or injury. Is he fit again?"
8939,Newcastle,Terrified as always. Feel like it's baked into my DNA at this point The more sure everyone is NUFC WILL win the more sure it’s a low block with Bowen scoring a worldie.  This weekend is full of crazy results.
8940,Newcastle,"I'm just thinking about how fucking cold I'm going to be.

Can't wait htl You could always wear a top mate"
8941,Newcastle,Should smash them hopefully haha 
8942,Newcastle,"I’m not going to get myself overconfident but it’s at home under the lights and we have a good record against them. We should have this.

Last year’s match was my game of the season! "
8943,Newcastle,"I’m nervous… because I slipped over and completely fucked my knee yesterday. Hardly slept and can barely walk… so I’m worried about how I’m going to get into town, squeeze into my seat, and get home after

But I think we’ll smash them "
8944,Newcastle,"We are about to get a manager sacked, and it isn’t ours! "
8945,Newcastle,"Whenever I feel confident we end up losing. I think 4-0 though, we should smash them realistically.  "
8946,Newcastle,"The amount of people saying we will batter them has me on edge 

They are a good side with good players. We should be able to beat them but there is a feel or arrogance in the air Away I'd agree with you but at home we're a different beast. Should have no problems taking 3 points."
8947,Newcastle,"It's the Whammers - I always feel one of two things will happen: They steamroller us our we bowl them over. Nothing in between. 

Anyway, that's just my (considerable) gut talking. Whammers. That is A1 sir."
8948,Newcastle,"Optimistic. Westham owe their fans a solid performance, but I think we'll have too much for them. "
8949,Newcastle,"It's either going to be 1-1 or 4-0 to us. If we can break them down early, get a goal and force them to come out we'll destroy them. If not (or if they nick an early goal) then it could be a repeat of our earlier problems. "
8950,Newcastle,"Even under Ashley West Ham at St James is a game that we usually do well in so it's not arrogant to suggest that we should be looking to put them away.

Try get that early goal and I reckon all confidence will go for them and then it's just a matter of keeping it going till we get a couple. 

At the same time the likes of Bowen are super dangerous so if they sit in a low block and defend well could be a tough night 

But if the players want euro football next season Isak, Bruno, Joelinton etc need to step up "
8951,Newcastle,Banana skin potential but excited. We usually come back strong from international breaks and we’re in form. 
8952,Newcastle,"I think we're our free flowing best and we stick four or five on them, Isak with a hattrick. 

There'll be goals. Last five seasons, our games against West Ham have had 43 goals. That's an average of 4.3 goals per game. We've scored 25, they've hit 18 in that period. 7 of the 10 games had 4+ goals. 

Record in the last five seasons is W: 5 D: 4 L: 1 "
8953,Newcastle,"West Ham will be crazy not to play a low block but this season they have been a bit kamakazi with their setups, if they play a high line I think we win by 4 or more.

But against a low block, with Longstaff and Willock starting, we will struggle, I'm just not sure we have an answer to a low block. This is my concern. Perhaps the time to bring Tonali on to force some space?"
8954,Newcastle,late mid week kick off at st james’? we could beat anyone. 
8955,Newcastle,"Time to show that we’re serious about trying to get into Europe. Enough of showing up for the big game only to switch off against the ‘beatable’ sides. 

I’d expect at least a performance that we’re proud of and would win the game 9 out of ten times. And if it’s that 1 of 10 games where we did everything we could but we lose/draw bc of bad refereeing/VAR so be it. "
8956,Newcastle,"What I find absolutely nuts is if we beat west ham and palace in our next two games, and liverpool drop points against southampton or man city, suddenly our game against Liverpool takes on potential ""title challenging"" connotations. Given the start we had to our season, that would be a crazy position to be in. "
8957,Newcastle,"Score draw for me

You just never know which West Ham team are going to turn up. 

All else fails just bring Callum Wilson on in a massive inflatable ball and let him do his usual against West Ham. "
8958,Newcastle,"Got a really good run of fixtures coming up so need the win to start that off, feeling the positivity of the recent results with the vague nerviness you get of a must-win game vs struggling team (win and meh it's expected, lose and it's a disaster)

Everything overshadowed by the Liverpool game for me, haven't beat the buggers since 2015 and no sign of that stopping any time soon with their form. "
8959,Newcastle,We'll be fine. As long as the international break hasn't knocked the wind out of our sails. I think it'll be a cagey start but we'll turn them over in the end. 
8960,Newcastle,"Confident, but as we all know this is Newcastle we’re talking about. "
8961,Newcastle,A huge chance to put ourselves back into the fight for the Top 4. 
8962,Newcastle,Joelinton. 
8963,Newcastle,Muller em 
8964,Newcastle,Just excited. Feels like this has been a long break. 
8965,Newcastle,We always seem to lose when we are confident and win when we aren’t. Potentially we could win to get more altitude for the drop in our Newcastle rollercoaster. Our positive sentiment has me worries. It’s like wallstreetbets… the opposite of our sentiment is usually the right answer.  Best rollercoaster I have been on. Up the mags. 
8966,Newcastle,"Im never optimistic when our fans are all in agreement that we should win a game. That has never turned out well for us, and tomorrow most likely wont be any different. Hope im wrong of course, but its happened far too many times for me to be confident. "
8967,Newcastle,i am feeling a quick 5-0 win today 😋 
8968,Newcastle,"Call it PTSD from a lifetime of supporting the Toon which has been akin to an abusive relationship for almost all of that time... 

 \- NUFC in good form before break.

 \- West Ham looking shite all season. 

\- Under the lights at SJP

\- Type of game we SHOULD be winning.

  
So I think with all that said we're definitely losing tonight ,100% getting battered, and i'll be telling people at work tomorrow that the black eye is from walking into the door, and the toon didn't really mean to hurt me they're lovely really "
8969,Newcastle,"Historically under Howe we’ve struggled to hit the ground running after an international break, this one came at the worst possible time too given our form going into it. Optimistic SJP under the lights can work its magic and push us over the line. Up until the Brighton game after the last international break, I believe we’d actually won every single game that immediately followed a break."
8970,Newcastle,They defo are. Our fans have quite a good relationship with theirs on twitter and they’ve been making jokes about how we’re gonna thrash them 8-0 all week Theres that 'West Ham Place' person that really makes me cringe. Proper takes the entire shaft and balls of Newcastle fans. I'm almost certain it's a troll.
8971,Newcastle,Gordon scored too 
8972,Newcastle,Didn’t know Kudus is suspended - that’s good news 
8973,Newcastle,Life as a Newcastle fan. Play a team at the bottom of the table and you’re bricking it more than a team at the top 😂 Like when we get a L2 side in the cups. You know we're gonna make it hard work
8974,Newcastle,Bowen will have a spring in his step though. Hopefully he’s the only one. Mr Lewis Hall is going to make that silly little boy wish he’d never chose to be a winger
8975,Newcastle,Followed by the traditional 2 months out with a knock and/or injury. 
8976,Newcastle,Is he fit again? Him and Trips should apparently be back for this game according to the athletic.
8977,Newcastle,The more sure everyone is NUFC WILL win the more sure it’s a low block with Bowen scoring a worldie.  This weekend is full of crazy results. 
8978,Newcastle,You could always wear a top mate 
8979,Newcastle,Away I'd agree with you but at home we're a different beast. Should have no problems taking 3 points. 
8980,Newcastle,Whammers. That is A1 sir. 
8981,Newcastle,This is my concern. Perhaps the time to bring Tonali on to force some space? 
8982,Newcastle,"Up until the Brighton game after the last international break, I believe we’d actually won every single game that immediately followed a break. Fair enough I stand corrected."

8987,Newcastle,Fair enough I stand corrected. 
8988,Newcastle,Amazing! 
8989,Newcastle,"To be fair the last time they went to Sunderland, they rolled out the red carpet! "
8990,Newcastle,"Darlo’s got a useless stadium As a fan from Darlo it’ll be class Hahahaba Yeah, I think this is the most likely answer. If we get any big European nights then they might be rotated around stadiums in London or Edinburgh, but Darlo just makes sense for domestic games, as weird as it would be, Not sure we want to find out the bill of fixing up that rust bowl. Best answer I can think of. Doing it up probably won't cost loads in the grand scheme of things, probably have about 20k max but we just have to stomach that for three years or so. Short term pain for long term gain, as some people say"
8991,Newcastle,"just play on the Town Moor, just got to make sure opposing team brings 2 spare jackets to put to down for posts. Nothing in the rules to say you *can't* have cows grazing on the pitch."
8992,Newcastle,"My theory (or “dream”, if you prefer) is that they’ll get permission to build on Leazes Park and build three-quarters of a new mega stadium on there, backing into the Leazes Stand. 

That will be big enough to meet or exceed the current capacity and then they’ll rebuild the Leazes Stand last in the opposite direction to complete the stadium while demolishing the rest and turning it into a park. 

That will give us the whole new stadium, but at least overlapping the existing St James’ site, thereby keeping everybody happy (except for people who hate football and like Leazes Park) 100% agree. Thats what’s what I’ve always thought. We build a modern three stand stadium large enough to move into, then over the course of time St James’ is dismantled and the 4th stand is added as and when feasible. What we take from Leases Park is then given back as green space once demolished. Disagree, build it further up the road and convert SJP to a huge indoor arena"
8993,Newcastle,"Gateshead stadium. Pop up a few temporary stands.

Gateshead can go… elsewhere for a bit Had occurred to me that we could build up Gateshead Stadium or Kingston Park for temporary stadium sharing, I’m sure the respective clubs would be happy for the investment, but I’m just not sure enough could be done for capacity and infrastructure at either site for even half our usual attendance. Lol, and where's that then ?"
8994,Newcastle,"My guess is one stand at a time, and the stand in question is just closed while it’s worked on while the others are open. That’s how they did the renovation at Anfield.  Fulham did that as well recently"
8995,Newcastle,"Buy some land, possibly somewhere like Blaydon. Build a small 10-15k ground that's permanent, then stick one of those Qatar-style temporary setups on to extend it. 


We play there, we leave and take down the extensions, the lasses can play there + Gateshead can get a long-term tenancy, we move into shiny new SJP and all is well with the world. 


It isn't going to happen, but it would work as an option that would at least keep a decent capacity without too much trouble. Plus they could put up a temporary Stack XL and have a captive audience for making matchday revenue/testing concepts. "
8996,Newcastle,"Big temporary stadium made out of containers like this [this?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium_974)

Although if I’m honest with you there’s almost no chance we’re renovating the current stadium, so we’ll be playing at SJP until the new ground is built then we’ll move straight in. Stadium 974 cost over $200m. There is no chance they are doing that."
8997,Newcastle,Consett? 
8998,Newcastle,"Bit far maybe, but Hampden Park? "
8999,Newcastle,"Assuming we can do the Stadium of Light, the Riverside perhaps? Otherwise we'd possibly be looking at something like Murrayfield. "
9000,Newcastle,They’ll rebuild in Leazes Park so it intersects the current stadium. They can take the whole new build to completion and make the last section complete during off season. 
9001,Newcastle,"Garages round the back of ours.
It's fog man back, ball owners also referee.
Tie breakers heads and vols and VAR is wor Smithy's Galaxy S4 he found outside Aldi. 
Everything else is resolved by pidgey or whoever is hardest decides. "
9002,Newcastle,Blyth! 
9003,Newcastle,"Surely Middlesbrough makes the most sense? I know we're supposed to have a rivalry with them but does anyone from either club actually care about it? Sunderland would have too much trouble so that's completely out of the question. Darlington gets mentioned a lot but thats like 25k seats. Riverside is 34k. 

Would be a huge benefit to both clubs. "
9004,Newcastle,Darlo with the club putting on buses from the city centre every home match 
9005,Newcastle,Darlo is 25k capacity right? So not sure how it would work. I also remember it's an absolute nightmare getting to and from the ground. 
9006,Newcastle,"Just find a field, place some jackets down as goalposts and get on with it from there. Proper football. "
9007,Newcastle,Ashington 
9008,Newcastle,YOu need a stadium that meets prem standards and the only one close  is the one in Sunderland. The next nearest is either leeds or one of the glasgow clubs. ANd it’d take years to rebuild SJP so it’dbe a real nightmare. So much better in the long and short term to build a new stadium. 
9009,Newcastle,"I know it might be sacrilege, but I could see the club doing a deal and us playing at the Stadium of Light for a season.

It would need a hell of a lot of policing and organising, but in reality is the only stadium nearby with a capacity close to what is needed. 

I don’t think it will happen, but it wouldn’t be the biggest surprise to me if it did happen. I don't really see it happening because too many fans are idiots but it could be in both clubs interests for sure. No way the police is agreeing to deal with newcastle fans in Sunderland every couple of weeks."
9010,Newcastle,100%. Renovating SJP I just feel is not practical 
9011,Newcastle,I'd assume we wouldn't rebuild and instead just build a new stadium in a fresh site nearby 
9012,Newcastle,"Liverpool redeveloped their stands to increase capacity without moving, we could do similar. Liverpool didn’t have the same issues as us There’s is no chance they will renovate. Doesn’t make any sense. The capacity won’t increase enough and the ground would still be unfit for purpose."
9013,Newcastle,"Ah, does that mean like you are on your period? Like when the painters are in? "
9014,Newcastle,As a fan from Darlo it’ll be class Hahahaba 
9015,Newcastle,"Yeah, I think this is the most likely answer. If we get any big European nights then they might be rotated around stadiums in London or Edinburgh, but Darlo just makes sense for domestic games, as weird as it would be, I used to work at the bar at the rugby club there and the stadiums really not in good shape, would take a crazy amount of good work to get in premier league standard. Although I guess money wouldn’t be an issue"
9016,Newcastle,Not sure we want to find out the bill of fixing up that rust bowl. Be cheaper than paying for repairs to SOS if we ever play a ‘home’ game there Probably only be a few million quid
9017,Newcastle,"Best answer I can think of. Doing it up probably won't cost loads in the grand scheme of things, probably have about 20k max but we just have to stomach that for three years or so. Short term pain for long term gain, as some people say "

What we take from Leases Park is then given back as green space once demolished. Green space in between the town and the stadium would quickly become a brown space i doubt the land goes back to the park. More likely, imo, is that the club commits to help fund park maintenance.

The land is far too financially valuable as city centre land. 

The park is also suffering as a result of lack of maintenance. It makes sense that we'd buy out the land, then come to the compromise of helping fund the maintenance of a park thats fallen in status enough that its lost it's protected status. 

We'd also likely want more parking for the VIP attendees, more out of stadium amenities like Stack, some open space for pop-up events etc. 

I just don't see how giving that land back to the park happens when it'd take ages to turn it into park, and its value is too high."
9020,Newcastle,"Disagree, build it further up the road and convert SJP to a huge indoor arena "

9022,Newcastle,"Lol, and where's that then ? St James Park. If we're at Gateshead, they can use there!

Honestly, this stuff is easy."
9023,Newcastle,Fulham did that as well recently

Honestly, this stuff is easy. Fair enough. Gateshead FC could use the extra seating, even if they don't fill up the place. lol Strong ""digging a hole to fill the gravel from digging a hole"" from Porridge vibes here"

9049,Newcastle,"Jamie Miley - Newport

Played a handful of games after an initial injury. Hasn't featured in the last couple of games. 

Max Thompson - Chesterfield 

Initially backup then broke into the first team playing 7 games. Dropped from matchday squad recently but back on the bench today. 

Joe White - MK Dons

Played 10 games and scored twice. Match ratings seem reasonably high too so appears to be having an impact.

Harrison Ashby - QPR

Was in and out at the start of the season but is getting more consistent minutes now. Played 80+ minutes in three of the last four games.  QPR are having a dreadful season though.

Miodrag Pivas - Willem II

Took a while to get involved as he was waiting for a work permit. Think he went back to his old club to train. Been mostly on the bench, played 90 minutes in the Dutch Cup but other than that only made two very late sub appearances. 

Jamal Lewis - Sao Paulo 

Involvement has been patchy with a few starts and some sub appearances. Got an assist in his last game but is currently out injured. Was called up for Northern Ireland back in October and played 60 mins against Belarus. "
9050,Newcastle,"Joe White on loan at MK Dons seems to be doing well but they’re game was postponed today. Another lad who doesn’t really count anymore since he left on a free is Kyle Crossley who scored a brace for South Shields today in a 5-1 win, he’s still fairly local so thought I should mention him. "
9051,Newcastle,I heard Harrison Ashby's name mentioned on Final Score earlier so he must have done something of note. Think it was an assist. 
9052,Newcastle,"I watched Harrison Ashby at QPR yesterday, hard to tell how good he actually is in a struggling team, especially when he’s playing left back for them - we should be trying to find him a better loan option than this, if we’re serious about him. "

9067,Nottingham Forest,Would be perfect but I doubt Brighton would let him go to us when we’re so close in the table & when he’d be second choice to Wood Assuming they're looking for a loan with an option given he's that far back in the pecking order.
9068,Nottingham Forest,Absolutely 
9069,Nottingham Forest,"As cover sure. As a long term prospect I expect he's a bit expensive and I'd rather go for that 15m Brazillian wonderkid I'm sure our scouts can dig up in the summer.  
If we keep wood it has to be for 2+ seasons and I don't want us to be paying his salary if he isn't at least joint 1st choice.  I'm also not ready to believe Taiwo is finished. "
9070,Nottingham Forest,I'd love it but don't see Brighton going for it unless they're looking to sell after the loan which surely they're not. 
9071,Nottingham Forest,Talented player that needs a reset.   Worked for CHO. 
9072,Nottingham Forest,"nah, decent player on his day but hasn't been in form recently and what's the point developing another club's young talent when we're so close to them in the table The point being you’d only loan with an option to buy"
9073,Nottingham Forest,"He dropped a hattrick on us so fuck it sign him up. I wouldn’t wanna live in brighton either shag Plus, we’re known for giving young talents a chance when their career isn’t going how it should, and with wood not getting any younger despite his class at the moment, I don’t see why nor"
9074,Nottingham Forest,"I trust our scouting team above anything else. But I really think he could be a good get, with 6-12 months of phasing in and competing with Wood. Loan with an option I'd assume. "
9075,Nottingham Forest,Good point. I'm assuming Moreno could become a permanent early if needed. Absolutely fine terminating JWP too
9076,Nottingham Forest,I'd get JWP gone yesterday tbh 
9077,Nottingham Forest,"Assuming they're looking for a loan with an option given he's that far back in the pecking order. No option wanted, he's just a year out of practice and the current front two have managed to become undroppable."
9078,Nottingham Forest,The point being you’d only loan with an option to buy would brighton want to sell him though? clearly a great talent in there and i can't imagine they'd want to let him go so soon
9079,Nottingham Forest,"Plus, we’re known for giving young talents a chance when their career isn’t going how it should, and with wood not getting any younger despite his class at the moment, I don’t see why nor "
9080,Nottingham Forest,Absolutely fine terminating JWP too Why not do both of the options Yep same
9081,Nottingham Forest,"No option wanted, he's just a year out of practice and the current front two have managed to become undroppable. "
9082,Nottingham Forest,"would brighton want to sell him though? clearly a great talent in there and i can't imagine they'd want to let him go so soon Isn’t that how they run their club though?

Find talent, give it a good polish, sell for a massive profit."
9083,Nottingham Forest,Why not do both of the options 
9084,Nottingham Forest,Yep same

9095,Nottingham Forest,Then let's fucking hope we can give it to him 
9096,Nottingham Forest,"Good job we're winning the third star then *Third and fourth. 


Sub's gone, you mods don't think big enough."
9097,Nottingham Forest,"It's good to have goals.

Literally and figuratively. "
9098,Nottingham Forest,"*Third and fourth. 


Sub's gone, you mods don't think big enough. "
9099,Nottingham Forest,He’s always been only a set piece specialist He's not even that any more
9100,Nottingham Forest,"He’s definitely 7th-choice midfielder. His lack of positional awareness is alarming. Yeah, he’s just providing squad depth at this point. He wouldn’t even be on the bench if everyone was fit.  
  
Unfortunately we hardly have any fit midfielders."
9101,Nottingham Forest,"West Ham fans did warn us he was anonymous mostly during games, except for dead balls/set pieces. "
9102,Nottingham Forest,"From set pieces alone he was a net positive for West Ham but he's not even delivering on that for us. Luckily he's a loan, I'd send him back and look for another midfield loan in January "
9103,Nottingham Forest,"No, Freuler was much better "
9104,Nottingham Forest,"Not quick enough, not combative enough. ""We're going to keep on getting bad results... Getting bad results..."""
9105,Nottingham Forest,Freuler might have been better tbh 
9106,Nottingham Forest,"Sort of. I think JWP was asked to do a job he can’t do against Arsenal.

I do think if we face teams who setup to defend against us and allow us to have the majority of possession, his ability to put balls into the box from deeper areas might snatch us a few points. He’s not a starter, but will be a good option to come on for certain situations / games. "
9107,Nottingham Forest,"Wow how quickly swell of opinion changes, it seemed 3 weeks ago the prevailing wind was that he was excellent and should be played over most other CM's.

Not seen the Arsenal game but assume he must have had a mare. Think most, myself included, we're happy at the option of someone that isn't MGW taking set pieces and JWP had good form there.

Then he actually played for us...and well he's been terrible across the board. I'm hopeful we'll move him on soon as we've far better options for CM and takers for set pieces, which still aren't MGW and start most games. Can’t lie I have not been a fan of JWP since he’s been here Wtf were they smoking and can I get their dealer's number? He's been gash the whole time and used up all his benefit of the doubt with me probably by the end of the Fulham game

Yes his corners are better than the majority of our first man-pelters last season. But not worth playing with a passenger in CM for"
9108,Nottingham Forest,Given how bad we were at defending set pieces over the last few seasons it was probably a decision that it was better for us to take him on loan than let someone else have him. He’s certainly more valuable to us not scoring against us. 
9109,Nottingham Forest,I think I’d like to see the 49ers sign him. Best use of his talents. There. I’m being positive. 
9110,Nottingham Forest,It has shown since his move to West Ham that he was an average player made to look good by being in a very poor Southampton team. 
9111,Nottingham Forest,He's not even that any more 
9112,Nottingham Forest,"Yeah, he’s just providing squad depth at this point. He wouldn’t even be on the bench if everyone was fit.  
  
Unfortunately we hardly have any fit midfielders. I dunno, I wouldn't kick Yateseh out of bed for eating crackers...;)"

9120,Nottingham Forest,"Thank you, was worried it was just in my head! "
9121,Nottingham Forest,"He certainly carried on where he left off with us in terms of how he sets a team up in the Prem but I don’t think any manager can sort Leicester out at the moment. Cooper’s done wonders getting them 10 points.

Coventry need to pounce on him asap. They’re thinking of appointing Lampard for crying out loud. Leicester still think they're a top seven club. Ten points and 15th is decent, considering the squad. Staying up is always the target, doesn't matter how, and Cooper was getting the occasional result that kept them just on the right side of the line, just like he did at Forest.

...Lampard you say?

![gif](giphy|MFIsOqzodLr7ewnkUb) The only appointment that can make sacking Mark Robins not completely stupid. On the flip side of it, Leicester could do worse than Robins themselves but nobody would be good enough for them even with the state of their squad. Never seen a group of fans overestimate the quality of a team so much. Agreed, no idea where they're going to turn to.

Coventry I could see being a great fit for him That’s a brilliant shout to be fair. Cov have already got Lampard - Cooper was shit for us, but seems like a nice bloke. 

He did well getting you guys up, but I suspect that's gonna be his legacy. Great job he did, though."
9122,Nottingham Forest,"Lmao gets a payout after 12 games, love you Cooper. Also helping drop the club closer to PSR issues. Top work agent Cooper."
9123,Nottingham Forest,Stevie cooper steeeevie cooper he ates the leicester he ates the derby forest are magiiiic 
9124,Nottingham Forest,This is 100% because we serenaded him in their tinpot stadium. They didn’t want to come to the City Ground and hear it
9125,Nottingham Forest,Whoever could have predicted this?! I didn’t think they’d sack a manager who has them outside of the relegation zone!
9126,Nottingham Forest,"Not even his fault Leicester are a fucking mess. Their fans hated him before he even took over Right?

Star summer signings were Oliver Skipp and Jordan Ayew, lost Dewsbury-Hall and Iheanacho in the same window.

Sponsor going bust and fans never happy with a manager closely associated with us.

Wout Faes at centre-half. 37-year-old Vardy on £140,000pw.

What chance did he have? Think it's a bit rough to say anybody hated Cooper, but he came in at a difficult time. Skipp is shit, Ayew looks like a decent loan signing. 

Can we interest you in a Faes? Anybody? Always going to be on a hiding to nothing there.  They weren't gunna be world beaters so anything else would've been a waste of his time"
9127,Nottingham Forest,"They never took to him. He shouldn't have went there, but c'est la vie. We'll always have Wembley. "
9128,Nottingham Forest,"Straight back down straight back down Leicester City 
Playing football the Cooper way "
9129,Nottingham Forest,He'll be managing Plymouth after they sack Rooney Cooper should have taken the Burnley job. He'd have got them back up I think. Then he'd have got sacked again probably lol
9130,Nottingham Forest,"I think this is just further proof that he was not suitable to be our manager in the long term under the type of expectations we rightfully have from our owner, those of us who were critical of Cooper before he was sacked pretty much said all the same things Leicester fans have about his style of football and his ability (or lack of) to manage and motivate players. Seems to confirm the rumours about the Worrall fallout or at least make them seem very plausible.

It was always going to be tough for him to make it work at Leicester in those circumstances and to expect him to play any less cautiously and with more of clear gameplan under his guidance than they have would have been highly unrealistic based on how he had operated up to that point. 

Their fans (some wanted him gone before the season proper kicked off) were never going to be on his side unless results and style of football was exceeding expectations and that didn’t happen, realistically it couldn’t happen with the type of system Cooper prefers and knows. Might work for under 17s and in the championship and when your backs are against the wall trying to avoid relegation but I think he struggles to motivate higher profile players and is less tactically astute than many would admit. 

I’m just grateful he was still in charge for the game at the king prawn crisp bowl so we will always have that as a memory, I was pretty much certain he wouldn’t still be in charge for the fixture at the city ground but at one stage there was talk of him being sacked before the season had actually kicked off. 

Cheers for the promotion season and survival season, we’ll always appreciate that but I do think he’s ruined it for himself to a degree, I think he’s better suited to a championship club and only suitable for a premier league club when it’s a situation of avoiding relegation. If you want to push on and play more attacking football with more goals he’s not the man.

I do think he conned a lot of our fans into thinking he’s better than he truly is and that he’s nicer/more pleasant than he truly is, I totally understand why we loved him at the time but on reflection he was kind of blowing smoke up our arses and love bombing us with the same sort of words week in week out and eventually it wore thin when it became clear he didn’t know how to move past the type of tactics which worked for him in the first premier league season.

Overall he probably did better than I expected him to with Leicester and the back to back wins probably gave him a little bit more time than he would have gotten otherwise but I also wonder what Leicester’s recruitment team expected anything other than what they got? 

I want Leicester to do as poorly as possible but that hasn’t changed since he was sacked I think you're being a little harsh here, I don't think he intentionally conned anyone. He always seemed sincere about his intentions, and really worked hard for our club. 


That said love him as we do, he'll probably need to prove himself again to earn another shot at a Premier League club. 


Best of luck to him, but maybe not to Leicester."

 I don't think our rousing songs of love for him in their backyard helped, but they're way ahead of where they should be with that squad. 


12 games? They signed him on a 3 year contract, didn't they? That's what, £15m to pay him off, then the same to replace him? They can't afford players. The sponsorshit deal ended when the gambling firm they sold their souls to collapsed. Seems mad."

9153,Nottingham Forest,"Mad results happen all the time it all evens out over a season. For example, who remembers that time we beat Liverpool at Anfield? Slot remembers. Like it was yesterday 🗣️"
9154,Nottingham Forest,"This result today is good for us. It'll give Ipswich some confidence and make them think they can bring their game to us and get a result. Our defence is good enough to stop them and ~~even~~ if MGW/Anderson are back, we should be able to control the midfield. Do we know for definite that MGW/Anderson are back? We’ve shipped 6 goals in two games without reply…"
9155,Nottingham Forest,United are not at their best. I think we'll snatch a 2-1 win from Ipswich 
9156,Nottingham Forest,We have Chris wood. 
9157,Nottingham Forest,Man U centre mid is shocking and was pretty much static for the most part. Bar Bruno I’m not sure if they’ve got any real decent players… I think the game said less about Ipswich and more about Man U. Precisely this. Garnacho might be the worst starting winger in the league
9158,Nottingham Forest,It has 1-1 written all over it 
9159,Nottingham Forest,Shitting it a bit tbh. Depends who's available. 
9160,Nottingham Forest,It's a Must win game . We got to stop the slide . We Have a lot of the top six to play in the coming month so my ideal of getting 30 points by the end of the year is looking quite slim.  I think 3 points against an improving Ipswich team is realistic. I thought we could've bloodied Arsenal nose like the Liverpool match but I think Arsenal had too much lose against Nottingham Forest so hence we lost. I think Nuno has to drill into this team the Brian Clough mantra that we are and can be the equal of any premier league team. I want to see Anderson start against Ipswich. This is just my 2 cents COYR. 
9161,Nottingham Forest,Well win. We’re a good team 
9162,Nottingham Forest,"We'll probably score, and probably concede a worldy to sami smokesdicks or Ohmarie Hutchinson "
9163,Nottingham Forest," Don’t think we will struggle with Ipswich

We will actually have a midfield again rather than it being injured which was sorely missing

Ipswich have also been shocking across all the numbers this season

Forest just need to out the past two games behind them and just think about how we beat all the other teams around the bottom this season and it’s an easy win "
9164,Nottingham Forest,This game is giving me bad feelings. 
9165,Nottingham Forest,"Fucking hell I can see it and all.

Anderson, Wood, and MGW, deliver us from evil. "
9166,Nottingham Forest,Slot remembers. 
9167,Nottingham Forest,Like it was yesterday 🗣️ Like it was 5 minutes ago🗣️

9169,Nottingham Forest,"We’ve shipped 6 goals in two games without reply… I was gonna say Murillo scored in the Newcastle game, forgetting we'd actually gone 1 up before getting absolutely shafted in the second half. So yeah, I guess 6 with no reply is correct. 🥲"
9170,Nottingham Forest,Precisely this. Garnacho might be the worst starting winger in the league

9179,Nottingham Forest,We need him more than ever after yesterdays midfield disaster. 
9180,Nottingham Forest,"Where is Morgan. Why is wood benched. What is happening. Wood's had a lot of travel in the past couple of weeks, so I can see why we might want to rest him in a game like this.

I can only assume that MGW's picked up a knock though, given that he's not even on the bench. Anderson missing too 😩😱 Nuno mentioned in pre match conference that jet lag has been a big issue, woods been effectively playing 12 hours ahead so 3am kick off for him if he’s not recovered yet"
9181,Nottingham Forest,"Giving them a sporting chance, fair play Nuno Taiwo preparing himself for his biannual goal against Arsenal"
9182,Nottingham Forest,"No Anderson? 

The International Break can totally get fucked. He didn't play during the break. Was already nursing a knock, I'm guessing it's still playing up. 🥲"
9183,Nottingham Forest,"Oh Lord. Going to be a tough, tough day. It's ok elanga will have his one good game this week."
9184,Nottingham Forest,I was looking forward to the game but not sure now. Glad our defence is intact. 
9185,Nottingham Forest,"If we win this, Arteta and slot gonna have to start a men's group "
9186,Nottingham Forest,Who’s that sexy brazilian shit house on the front? Murillosexual 
9187,Nottingham Forest,This will probably come back to bite me in the Arse but it looks a bit like packing the midfield to limit Odegaard’s influence and break at them with pace up front. Awoniyi’s looked a lot more mobile lately and loves a goal against that lot. Yates in there to kick them about a bit and get them all stroppy I think it’s more we don’t have any other option in the midfield without MGW and Anderson
9188,Nottingham Forest,Big T hopefully coming to haunt Arsenal again 
9189,Nottingham Forest,would’ve preferred a back 5 with this personnel 
9190,Nottingham Forest,Could we be playing Dominguez at 10? A fellow forest FM player I see
9191,Nottingham Forest,No midfield creativity is going to hurt Who needs creativity when Yates is kicking shins?
9192,Nottingham Forest,Not right if mgw wasn't fully fit he fucked off to England duty It’s not like he’s setting the world on fire for us at the minute. Anderson’s a bigger miss.
9193,Nottingham Forest,"Wood's had a lot of travel in the past couple of weeks, so I can see why we might want to rest him in a game like this.

I caused this."

9204,Nottingham Forest,Tuning in for the AFTV meltdown later https://youtu.be/SoFQuC5Hb3I?si=HLMJKS8XQKM74bl0 You enjoy that?
9205,Nottingham Forest,Maybe his head's gone being the billy big balls now playing for England 
9206,Nottingham Forest,"https://youtu.be/SoFQuC5Hb3I?si=HLMJKS8XQKM74bl0 I remember that melt Ty ranting about what have we won to have the right to banter them after we cost them the title, even Robbie was embarrassed lmao"
9207,Nottingham Forest,"You enjoy that? Imagine being so insecure about your (big) clubs success that you feel the need to track down a random comment from a ""small club"" to feel better. This is why Man Utd and Liverpool will always be bigger than you, and London as a whole. Now fuck off."

Arsenal: 0 And how many league titles you got ? Just the one is it"
9212,Nottingham Forest,"And how many league titles you got ? Just the one is it Champions of Europe, you'll NEVER sing that"
9213,Nottingham Forest,"Champions of Europe, you'll NEVER sing that 3-0 enjoy your AFTV session 😂😂"
9214,Nottingham Forest,3-0 enjoy your AFTV session 😂😂 Why argue with an Arsenal fan when you can just wait❄️🤣
9215,Nottingham Forest,Why argue with an Arsenal fan when you can just wait❄️🤣 
9216,Nottingham Forest,"The loss of Sangare and Danilo is starting to bite, and without Anderson or Gibbs white, the midfield is starting to looking really frail. Sangare is not a loss"
9217,Nottingham Forest,Was he on the pitch? 😂😂 if you watch all three goals he's the one staring at the ball as it goes past him
9218,Nottingham Forest,Elliot Anderson should never be allowed off the pitch again Why tf wasn't he playing is he injured
9219,Nottingham Forest,"I legitimately said ""Who's 18?"" not once but twice today. If only Thomas Partey had your inquisitive mind."
9220,Nottingham Forest,"Sticky this thread.

Love a scapegoat we "
9221,Nottingham Forest,"Personally think he's too slow , probably paying a fortune in wages.  
Couple decent dead balls nothing to write home about "
9222,Nottingham Forest,We need Danilo and Anderson available and If they aren't we should play an extra defender or forward and live with Yates and Dominques alone because he's a waste of a player. Sangare doesn't bother me I'm not a fan 
9223,Nottingham Forest,Maybe the real genius has been Rui Pedro Silva all along #getbacktothestandswithnuno 
9224,Nottingham Forest,"Sangare should be back soon.

When Danilo and Sangare come back from their injuries the midfield will be stacked again

Just a shame for Yates as he will be benched "
9225,Nottingham Forest,"Not this sacrificial lamb bs again I mean, do you honestly think he had a good game?"
9226,Nottingham Forest,Sangare is not a loss One of the worst takes I have ever seen on this sub
9227,Nottingham Forest,😂😂 if you watch all three goals he's the one staring at the ball as it goes past him TBF on the second he's the guy running into the frame at the last second toward the goalscorer he was supposed to be marking
9228,Nottingham Forest,"Why tf wasn't he playing is he injured Must be, he was carrying a knock before the break."
9229,Nottingham Forest,If only Thomas Partey had your inquisitive mind. Bravo.
9230,Nottingham Forest,"I mean, do you honestly think he had a good game? "
9231,Nottingham Forest,One of the worst takes I have ever seen on this sub 
9232,Nottingham Forest,TBF on the second he's the guy running into the frame at the last second toward the goalscorer he was supposed to be marking 
9233,Nottingham Forest,"Must be, he was carrying a knock before the break. "
9234,Nottingham Forest,Bravo. 
9235,Nottingham Forest,"This has been a miserable day, so here's a picture of some people building a snowman. It made me feel slightly better.

9236,Nottingham Forest,"Lost to a much better team - welcome to reality.

It wasn’t that we’re terrible, or shameful, or anything like that.

When you go away to strong teams in the Premier League, especially without two of your best footballers in MGW and Anderson, this is what happens 9 times out of 10.

Luckily for us, the Chelsea and Liverpool games were a marvellous exception that make it 1 out of 3 rather than that 9 out of 10.

Celebrate that, because that’s where us and another dozen teams in the league are. You must have been watching a different game to me.

My face is as red as my shirt. Embarrassing performance. It was a terrible, shameful performance. Don’t dress it down.

A disgusting performance all round.

We played both Anderson and MGW against Newcastle at home, btw. How’d that go?"
9237,Nottingham Forest,"Not a lot to write home about there, completely outplayed by a better side.

There is one big question though, what on earth does Ward-Prowse offer in open play? Yet to see anything from him.  Never mind open play, his set pieces have been average in a Forest shirt too!"
9238,Nottingham Forest,It wasn't our most impressive 90 minutes but we can lose to Arsenal away and be ok.  COYR 
9239,Nottingham Forest,At least we didn’t lose 4-1 to Wolves And if we're going to lose to a North London team at least it wasn't 4-0
9240,Nottingham Forest,Beat Ipswich and I won't care about how crap these past 2 games have been. Likely to still be in 7th after Monday night so still a good season I mean we've just lost our first away game in like 7 going back to last season. 
9241,Nottingham Forest,"Well, we were shit. 

Tough to analyse now. Evidently, every single one of us would bite your hand off to be in the position we’re in after this many games. So that’s a positive.

The problem is that it feels like we’re sliding backwards, and puts undue pressure on the Ipswich game next week. There’s a real risk the whole feel good factor could sour.

Swings and roundabouts. Go have a pint and enjoy the rest of your evening shaggers.

EDIT: Just realised I’m quite keen for Danilo to be back. Feels like he fits a profile we’ve missed these past few games - aggressive in the middle but a bit better progressively than Dominguez or Yates. "
9242,Nottingham Forest,Can't wait for the Slot meltdown about how Arsenal won at home against a team that beat him at home. 
9243,Nottingham Forest,"Jesus some of you lot are mental. We’re seventh in the league a third of the way through the season and have already played Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea away. 

Swear we have the most fickle fans. We go on a bit of a run and all of a sudden we are gutless and pathetic for losing to Newcastle and Arsenal. Agreed.

No Gibbs-White and no Anderson.  Danillo still out as is Sangare.  That's a lot of quality missing from midfield which you can't afford against Arsenal.

Top that off with Wood put (I assume knackered from international duty half way around the world).

If we get Morgan and Elliot back fit we will be back to playing well.

We also need to remember that we are way ahead of where we should be, so another season of filling out the bench and we might be viable to compete properly for European spots. It's not losing that bothers me, it's the manner in which we did. Two games where we just didn't turn up at all. I don't care if we lose, you don't walk out like you've already lost.

Nunos Wolves did this at the end of his time there too. Don't want a repeat of that."
9244,Nottingham Forest,"couldve use MGW or Anderson today. Not enough creativity without them. i think its understated how fucked we are with our midfield since when had no natural subs for any of the 3 today. We're a diabolical team without either of those two. No spark. Whatever technical ability JWP is known for has gone, he's just a runner now, and he's only good at that in a midfield two."
9245,Nottingham Forest,"Dreadful performance. Reminiscent of the previous seasons. Conceding 6 in 2 games is last season's number.  In the end, it's away at Arsenal, annoyed at the performance and result but not the end of the world.  I'd be more worried if we don't beat Ipswich next week given the run in. "
9246,Nottingham Forest,"Home form never lies. When you deep it, that’s been the biggest red herring this season as to our progress. Forest 6-0 Ipswich, 4-4-fucking-2 hatricks for Taiwo and Woody boi. We will be there."
9247,Nottingham Forest,At least Ipswich have been good recently so they can't play themselves back into form against us after a decidedly underwhelming start like Newcastle and Arsenal have. 
9248,Nottingham Forest,Clocked out after 2 minutes. Outplayed well done arsenal. 
9249,Nottingham Forest,"We had no idea how to deal with them today. It’s not lack of effort, or mentality, or individuals being shit.

They dragged us all over the pitch and we followed them, leaving massive spaces for them to exploit. We needed more structure and confidence in how tracks what runs. I’d argue if anything we did too much chasing about trying to match them up man for man, instead of defending the spaces.

Their second goal the prime example, Dominguez charging out of his position to close Saka out wide, CHO stood doing nothing, and Partey in loads of space.

I’ll put it down to some late changes to our lineup and players away until later in the day.

I do think it’s proof that in some games Nuno is right to drop CHO and or Elanga and bring more defensively minded players in to manage the games. Obviously not an option today given the injuries. "
9250,Nottingham Forest,"Midfield was awful to be honest, very disappointing we had no real options from the bench.

It's an area we're normally a fairly stacked in so hopefully won't be an issue going forward.

I think if we confidently beat Ipswich we can go onto the Manchester games with a decent chance. "
9251,Nottingham Forest,"I'm gonna down vote every knee jerk, childish tantrum in this thread. It is properly embarrassing to have fans ad fickle as ours! 100% agree. I feel the pain, frustration like any fan but to spit your dummy out after every loss is pathetic."
9252,Nottingham Forest,"Any team in the league would have beaten us today, we were that poor. "
9253,Nottingham Forest,"Feel sorry for the fans that took the trip down to London.  Spineless performance really, we’d lost that game before we came out of the tunnel. "
9254,Nottingham Forest,"Also, fuck you Keir Starmer you Blairite backstabbing hypocritical genocide condoning spineless Tory fuck-up wasting little git "
9255,Nottingham Forest,Awoniyi was absolutely dire today as well as his mates as a 3. They rely on others to do the work. Elanga and Hudson Odoi don't have any fight in them. Those 3 will need to be changed I'd hate to be any of them during Clough's reign. Lazy and open hand berating other players when things go wrong. Elanga was watching Saka but moving away from him when he scored.
9256,Nottingham Forest,This is the content this sub needs 
9257,Nottingham Forest,Did fuck all for my mood.  Appreciate the effort tho You've earned that flair
9258,Nottingham Forest,Another forest fan in Edinburgh? Didn’t realise they existed  
9259,Nottingham Forest,"You must have been watching a different game to me.

My face is as red as my shirt. Embarrassing performance. "
9260,Nottingham Forest,"It was a terrible, shameful performance. Don’t dress it down.

A disgusting performance all round.

We played both Anderson and MGW against Newcastle at home, btw. How’d that go? That just goes to show how far we’ve come that people like you get to mither about us getting pasted by a team we probably expected to be pasted by at the start of the season. 

Shameful is a tag I would reserve for games like Oldham away or Yeovil at home where the reputation of the football club actually took serious damage. 

A few bad performances after a strong start to the season is expected because that’s the nature of this league - the rich, powerful teams generally beat the teams that are trying to scrap to make it into mid-table or beyond.

We were poor today, but we were poor because they were very good. They have better players and we weren’t able to affect the game."
9261,Nottingham Forest,"Never mind open play, his set pieces have been average in a Forest shirt too! "
9262,Nottingham Forest,And if we're going to lose to a North London team at least it wasn't 4-0

We were poor today, but we were poor because they were very good. They have better players and we weren’t able to affect the game. We have different standards, clearly.

Two bad performances from a strong start to the season isn’t to be expected. It’s actually the opposite due to the nature of a strong start.

I will always put my hand up and say that we got beat by a better team but what I won’t stand for is completely inept performances showing no threat, no defensive solidity, or frankly any fucking clue. Which the last two games have offered.

Arsenal weren’t and have not been good for months. They haven’t won a game in the PL for the whole of November so I expected to at least be able to exist in their half for more than 5 minutes or even defend in a basic way. Clearly too much to ask for considering, by your standards, such attributes are reserved for teams like Yeovil only.

We’re a year three Prem club and that performance resembled year one. It’s not good enough."
9271,Nottingham Forest,"Seriously, tho. Are you confident we beat Ipswich? No, we've always struggled against the teams we should beat. But if Anderson and MGW are back, and the fans are rocking, then I think the team will deliver."

We’re a year three Prem club and that performance resembled year one. It’s not good enough. It’s tempting to think like this (“completely inept” etc) when we lose heavily. 

And we were outclassed by a midfield containing two Euros winners and an ex-Real Madrid prodigy. Plus Saka skinned our full back a few times. 

But Murillo and Milenkovic made tonnes of tackles and clearances, Sels was decent and the wingers were trying, it just didn’t come off. 

It’s not embarrassing, it’s just life playing the big teams away. If next week turns out the same way, we can talk…"

9275,Nottingham Forest,"Nuno my brother, pls get back in the stands "
9276,Nottingham Forest,"We're playing like last season's Forest here, need to wake up "
9277,Nottingham Forest,"It's annoying that Saka, who wasn't fit enough for England, is flying and looks deadly, whilst our 'England Man' came back with a knock :-( "
9278,Nottingham Forest,This has been such a non-event. We're unwatchable without Anderson or MGW. And without nuno in the stands
9279,Nottingham Forest,"Taiwo looks like a shell of himself. What happened to the man I loved After the Madri and Taiwo curses we need to shut the sub down To be fair only his second start of season and has played less than 1 game in total minutes He was never really that good, mate."
9280,Nottingham Forest,Doesn’t count he should be in jail 
9281,Nottingham Forest,Maybe Rui Pedro was the real mastermind after all 
9282,Nottingham Forest,"Jota and/or Sosa deserve a run now, Elanga's out of it and CHO's le cut inside routine isn't consistent enough "
9283,Nottingham Forest,Please win Forest as fucking Kier Starmer being there 
9284,Nottingham Forest,"commentators dont mention us missing our 2 most creative players since we arent big 6, but arsenal were apparently in an injury crisis for a short time lol Who's the other one? Danilo?"
9285,Nottingham Forest,A 17 year old should be smoking raspberry vapes at the back of the bus not scoring against Forest 
9286,Nottingham Forest,“Unlucky to get a yellow” studs into the ankle are fine if your on arsenal ig 
9287,Nottingham Forest,Had to be that cunt 
9288,Nottingham Forest,Rapist piece of shit 
9289,Nottingham Forest,"JWP stinks, sorry he's been so poor. Absolute passenger, set pieces have been poor as well.

I know we've got a difficult run of games but will be disappointed if we lose every one of the tough fixtures we have Passenger is exactly right, hate to do the stereotypical Forest thing of scapegoating but haven't been impressed at all"
9290,Nottingham Forest,Big T's work rate is on at least Been much better than I expected today. Wish we had Gibbs-White or Anderson to serve him a bit more
9291,Nottingham Forest,Yates should realistically be able to send off 2 arsenal players and score an equaliser 
9292,Nottingham Forest,Upson annoyed because he thinks Yates shouldn't be trying to win through ball!? Fuck off Commentary has been a circle jerk of Arsenal. If Yates had gone to challenge without his head Sakas still got his foot 6ft up
9293,Nottingham Forest,"Warning signs were there before the international break tbh, I know it's Arsenal but this has been fucking shocking today "
9294,Nottingham Forest,"We're gonna get pumped today, aren't we?

Elanga and CHO doing fuck all and nobody providing them with any service. Elanga does the usual. Runs directly into a defender"
9295,Nottingham Forest,Get Ward-Prowse off and put Jota on. We need some energy injected into the side. Elanga's set-piece delivery has been fine lately anyway. 
9296,Nottingham Forest,Yates adding Arsenal fans to his list of enemies after that 
9297,Nottingham Forest,JWP and Elanga off for Sosa and Jota please 
9298,Nottingham Forest,"We win this 3-2.

Awoniyi goalmouth scramble. Wood header. Jota from a Neco cutback in injury time.

I am not a crackpot. Are you Shniper in disguise?"
9299,Nottingham Forest,Nuno back to the stands please! 
9300,Nottingham Forest,"Ward Prowse is this seasons Jonjo Shelvey, seen enough calling it now Hopefully he would have a better attitude to getting benched At least he doesn’t look like this guy

![gif](giphy|aU4jau5ql99EA)"
9301,Nottingham Forest,Conceded 6 goals without a reply now going back to the Newcastle game. Not great. unreal going from back to back 3 goals in west ham and leicester to conceding six (6) goals without one response
9302,Nottingham Forest,Looks worse for Sels on every replay. 
9303,Nottingham Forest,"We're lucky that Arsenal are playing with their food here, don't know how this is still 1-0 "
9304,Nottingham Forest,Did Elanga think we’d put Miguel up front? Cant afford to be so wasteful.  
9305,Nottingham Forest,Rapist twat 
9306,Nottingham Forest,"Commentary begging for a red against us, cunts Matthew Upson getting gulag, wonder if we can ban him from the sub"
9307,Nottingham Forest,"Slightly freaked out by a team with no MGW, Anderson or Wood. Prove me wrong please lads.  Nuno says Morgs ""isn't in the right moment"". I feel like that's a classic Nunoism that doesn't mean anything, but if another manager said that I'd freak out and think something was seriously wrong."
9308,Nottingham Forest,Gonna be a longgg day lads Feels like how many will they get already
9309,Nottingham Forest,what happened to us? We went from dominating teams a few weeks ago to being meek little kittens 
9310,Nottingham Forest,"Frustrating when compared to early in the season. We never had much possession, but were effective at suppressing the opposition and disrupting their flow. Now we look more like last season - low possession but also conceding chances and not making the most of our counters.

Not sure what the answer is. Yep, we were compact in the middle earlier on in the season and getting our foot in when it came into their forwards.  They’ve got acres of space now, just walking through us with ease."
9311,Nottingham Forest,Haha outplayed in every department this half but somehow fished 3 yellow cards out of them. 
9312,Nottingham Forest,New strategy: keep drawing yellows 
9313,Nottingham Forest,"If games were judged on drawing yellow cards, we'd be absolutely hammering them "
9314,Nottingham Forest,"In short: Shit

In long: Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit "
9315,Nottingham Forest,Absolute miracle that this is only 1-0.  Need to come out fighting in the second half and actually believe we can get something out of this game.  Giving them far too much respect at the minute and essentially laying out the red carpet for them to to stroll their way to a win. 
9316,Nottingham Forest,Looks like Yates is playing up front. Wtf. 
9317,Nottingham Forest,Hopefully the jet lag convinces Woody that Gabriel and Saliba are the Vanuatu CBs and he scores five 
9318,Nottingham Forest,Being called one of the best defensive teams in the league has really cursed us 
9319,Nottingham Forest,"Pretty poor stuff unfortunately right after the terrible half against Newcastle. Hopefully we'll get back into gear at home next week. Relegation really doesn't seem like a possibility so not too stressed about a loss away at arsenal. It's a game I don't mind losing, it's the lack of any meaningful response to arsenal and newcastle that bothers me. I don't mind losing to either, but at least give them a tough time of it"
9320,Nottingham Forest,That is so shit - we’ve looked incredibly brittle at the back 
9321,Nottingham Forest,I’m starting to think that awoniyi might be unironically too bulky for the premier league He’s cooked
9322,Nottingham Forest,We're looking worse than Leicester did earlier today and they were shite 
9323,Nottingham Forest,"Yates in the number 10 role. Oh dear.... Honestly unsure why he’s in 10 when Dominguez is more attack minded. No idea why he’s up there, be better to have either of the other 2 in the 10."
9324,Nottingham Forest,All Timber and no Wood makes Jack a dull boy 
9325,Nottingham Forest,We look like we have less men on the field. Just being outplayed in every position The JWP effect.
9326,Nottingham Forest,Awoniyi is a proper bruiser when he gets stuck in He's too bulky for the Arsenal defenders
9327,Nottingham Forest,"JWP fails at a set piece again. Clearly he's lost it.  He hasn't taken a threatening direct free kick since he left Southampton. West Ham never got what they paid for. The sample size is too low, though. He’s taken, what, 8 free kicks for us? I can only think of about 2 in dangerous positions. We simply do not win enough free kicks around the box to give him the opportunities to work his magic."
9328,Nottingham Forest,"Prem's like Fifa. If a midfield player's got no pace, they're beyond useless. Looking at you jwp and sangare "
9329,Nottingham Forest,"Crying out for Jota at 10.

Half-a-dozen ways you can make that happen. But this ain’t it. "
9330,Nottingham Forest,I thought Saka had beaten Murillo there but he's just so w-i-i-i-i-i-i-d-e Mans consumes 18 yards all by hisself We love our large lad
9331,Nottingham Forest,Lol Arteta looks like he's about to cry from all these cards 
9332,Nottingham Forest,If they get another red today I'll piss myself laughing even if we lose 
9333,Nottingham Forest,Why does the rapist always score against us? 
9334,Nottingham Forest,Why have we collectively decided to be shit...Nuno included? Agreed we're shit but I mean it's Arsenal away POTM/MOTM curse is real.
9335,Nottingham Forest,"Chris wood hat trick? No service on offer today, thanks for understanding. Nottingham Forest football club."
9336,Nottingham Forest,Clear fucking dive from Saka 
9337,Nottingham Forest,"3-0 is poor honestly, not liking the rolling over and having our bellies tickled the last couple of games "
9338,Nottingham Forest,That feels like a massive letoff.  Almost been caught out now twice in 5 minutes 
9339,Nottingham Forest,Always loved VAR. 
9340,Nottingham Forest,Arsenal diving all over the shop 
9341,Nottingham Forest,3 in midfield but may aswell have 1. Just isn’t working atm 
9342,Nottingham Forest,They’re genuinely taking the piss out of us here.  Midfield are chasing shadows and when they do get the ball they lack any sort of technical ability to do anything with it. 
9343,Nottingham Forest,"Get JWP out of there, he brings less than nothing "
9344,Nottingham Forest,Are Aina's shorts too big for the Premier League? 
9345,Nottingham Forest,"Interesting that they’re on three yellows now. If I were Nuno, I’d make that very clear.

Already seen how much poorer Arsenal are when down to 10. "
9346,Nottingham Forest,Nice biased commentary so far 
9347,Nottingham Forest,"Murillo so good at defending by the way - clear Saka is going to cut inside and shoot, and he reads it. "
9348,Nottingham Forest,How is that a foul? 
9349,Nottingham Forest,Never a yellow that btw - refs felt he had to balance things out 
9350,Nottingham Forest,Crap first half but in reality this is probably a top 5 team in the world and whilst there is only 1 goal in it we can always get back in it. Silver linings or something 
9351,Nottingham Forest,"Just remember…..

Champions of Europe, they’ll never sing that. "
9352,Nottingham Forest,"Just poured a drink, need another drink "
9353,Nottingham Forest,Probably the easiest game Arsenal played this season.... even Leicester gave them a game. 
9354,Nottingham Forest,"So, are there any youth players that will actually put a shift in in central midfield next game assuming we don't have anyone back from injury? JWP is (and all season has been) worse than playing with 10 men. He's a luxury player with no luxury. What was Nuno thinking starting 3 luxury players. What does Jota have to do to get a start over Elanga, always has more impact "
9355,Nottingham Forest,"Well, it wasn't 4-0 which would have been demoralising. Awonyi looked strong. Ipswich is an absolute must win now. "
9356,Nottingham Forest,"Alright lads, that's enough of that. Time to pull it together "
9357,Nottingham Forest,"Come on Elanga, you can’t always run past your man, we need more aggression from you there. "
9358,Nottingham Forest,We look fuckin pitiful. 
9359,Nottingham Forest,This is going to be a very long afternoon 
9360,Nottingham Forest,"The fuck is Aina doing there - when under the kosh, keep the ball for fige fucking seconds, even if you just pass it around the back "
9361,Nottingham Forest,Saka and Odegaard are pretty much having a kickaround taking the piss right now 
9362,Nottingham Forest,Clock can’t run fast enough. Second match in a row we look dreadful and unrecognizable  
9363,Nottingham Forest,Keith hates the real socialist reds 
9364,Nottingham Forest,Can one of these midfielders just be Odegaard's babysitter and never give him a yard. Better than whatever the midfield is doing rn. Should be Yates job; just follow him around and take him out of the game completely and Arsenal crumbles. Chelsea demonstrated this for all to see.
9365,Nottingham Forest,This midfield is a foggin dizgrace 
9366,Nottingham Forest,"Is Yates playing as a 10? Nuno overcooked this one Yes. I’d have him on the lad who’s running the show myself, think his name is Odegaard, but I’m not a football manager. He’s having a go but he’s no Gibbs White Making his runs too early. Supposed to be a boxcrashing 8.

Arsenal have picked a weird midfield that Nuno wasn't prepared for so that's not helping."
9367,Nottingham Forest,Upson's Arsenal bias on comms is shocking 
9368,Nottingham Forest,Ward Prowse gone from Juninho to Sunday league free kick taker ffs That’s unkind to Sunday leaguers
9369,Nottingham Forest,Yates masterclass Peacock commentary: Saka had a right to put his foot there. DUDE THERE WAS A HEAD THERE.
9370,Nottingham Forest,Yates wins so many fouls what a lad 
9371,Nottingham Forest,How tf is that yellow worthy Crowd influenced 100%
9372,Nottingham Forest,"Time for Elanga to take a seat for a game or two I think, good at set plays yes… but need more of a combatant I think… give Jota a go His ego is crazy.
Watch the behind the scenes videos and whenever they ask him who will score first or whatever, everyone says Wood, Elanga always says himself. 


It's one thing to back yourself, but when you're playing this badly it's just delusional. "
9373,Nottingham Forest,"TV off. Until next time, lads. "
9374,Nottingham Forest,"Fuck it get one of them sent off or injured now, hopefully the rapist "
9375,Nottingham Forest,"Let’s be realistic. Yates hat trick, Wood 2. "
9376,Nottingham Forest,I’m from the future this guy’s right 
9377,Nottingham Forest,"The absolute salt if we ended Arsenal's title chances again, and this early too

They go crazy whenever we beat them I’m here just for the Arsenal fans meltdown on social media post match."
9378,Nottingham Forest,Final some real talk 
9379,Nottingham Forest,I dreamt it was 10-0 to forest so this sounds more realistic 
9380,Nottingham Forest,"Nah, 8 Nil forest minimum! "
9381,Nottingham Forest,"Don't know what everyone on here was smoking, but I'll pass. "
9382,Nottingham Forest,"Only an 8 goal swing behind what actually happened Better than being miserable saying we would lose

Also didn’t know our entire midfield would be out injured"

9443,Nottingham Forest,"I could honestly see it going either way. Arsenal are not in good form and obviously Forest are red-hot, so I'm leaning towards a win. Can't count out players with quality like Odegaard pulling something out his ass though. 


My prediction is a draw and that the referee tries to make it all about themselves. The PGMOL must be destroyed.  "
9444,Nottingham Forest,We'll probably lose but imagine if we managed to keep up this away form. Would be a massive bosst of confidence heading into this tough run of games (not that we shouldn't be confident already).

For examples selling Brenny J for 50m and buying two wingers for far less 

To sell Murrilo for 70m would likely mean replacing him with lesser quality but still spending the funds. The price needs to be what Murrilo is worth to us, not a price we think a team should pay for a good centre back nowadays. I don't give a fuck if United or Man City overspend and will happily have their pants down. Other teams do it 

We are 5th in the league, keep our squad together and let's progress to stay at this level instead of bending over to sell our best player for a buyers price because we want money that will never be ours"

If he wants to move we have to accept big offers at some point if he’s not going to be willing to extend his contract. He’s with us until 2028, which means things start getting awkward in 18 months to 2 years time which is when his price will start to drop. Hopefully the forthcoming European football will encourage him to extend his deal. FWIW, I completely agree. I don't want to sell him and would love to see us build a team around our young stars. However, only 6 defenders have ever been sold for more than £70mil. It's a lot of money for a defender and I don't think we can refuse it if someone bids..."

Hes the star player at a team sitting in 5th in the PL. Is very young for a cb in his 3rd season, on a long contract and is the perfect fit for the possession based teams at the top. I'd want stupid money or just keep him as our rock

9522,Nottingham Forest,"In all seriousness much as we love him now, feels like we got very lucky with how it turned out. Didn't make sense when he first came in as his form at Newcastle was crap, the fee was too high and his style of play didn't suit our system (or so it seemed at first). Got to give him and Nuno massive credit for knuckling down and making the system and him work for each other I don't remember him displaying such a mastery of transitional counter-attacking play at Burnley. Nuno has really unlocked him. Wood's one touch layoffs to link play and set up counters work so well. You know, the deal looked so crap for us at the time, I have half wondered whether it was somehow tied in with the Anderson favour they gave to us. 

Or perhaps Anderson was just PSR desperation. Either way, we've absolutely come out of those deals laughing our way up the league."
9523,Nottingham Forest,"tl:dr - he started scoring goals i like player who play good  
chris wood play good  
i love my kiwi striker

yipeee"
9524,Nottingham Forest,"If anyone wants an example of how good a job Nuno has done at Forest, you show them the player Chris Wood has become in just under a year.

Whatever Nuno saw that admittedly a lot of us didn’t, has now blessed us with a striker who’s never been more prolific at this level. 

For me, his turnaround as well as the signing of Sels in January were the biggest differentials in helping us to stay in the PL. For sure, without Sels I’d say we’d be in the championship right now I totally agree with your sentiment but he (Wood) clearly had the skill all along. You're totally right about Nuno's approach and guidance bringing out the absolute best in him, but take nothing away from Wood, he was banging them in at Burnley and Leeds without ever getting the attention he deserved before us.


I saw him scoring a lot of those goals, but somehow still didn't think he was good to cut it with us when he arrived, because apparently, 40 years in as a fan, I still know fuck all.


I still feel guilty as fuck every time I think about his reception to our club. I don't know any Forest fans who actually believed in him at first. When he wins the Ballon d'Or and takes us into Europe, I'll be in a gulag somewhere eating my words. "
9525,Nottingham Forest,"Cooper didn't want him and often played him on the left of a three up front, which was never going to work. I said at the time you can't play 10 years in the Prem and be that shit (whereas the Championship is chock full of absolutely shit players stealing a living), we were obviously not using him correctly. He's a fairly limited but very effective goal scorer if you play to his strengths, and that's what Nuno has done. Like...in the nicest possible way...Lineker at his best. Stick a ball in the box and he'll be there. It's mad with Wood though, because he shows time and time again that modern defenders apparently come unravelled quickly against an old fashioned centre forward."

9527,Nottingham Forest,"He started scoring goals for fun, not hard "
9528,Nottingham Forest,Feels like we were linked with him in every transfer window since 2010. The wait was worth it 
9529,Nottingham Forest,"I thought we got fleeced at first with the fee, but I was judging him based on Newcastle form not his Burnley form. "
9530,Nottingham Forest,I don't remember him displaying such a mastery of transitional counter-attacking play at Burnley. Nuno has really unlocked him. Wood's one touch layoffs to link play and set up counters work so well. 
9531,Nottingham Forest,"You know, the deal looked so crap for us at the time, I have half wondered whether it was somehow tied in with the Anderson favour they gave to us. 

Or perhaps Anderson was just PSR desperation. Either way, we've absolutely come out of those deals laughing our way up the league. "
9532,Nottingham Forest,"i like player who play good  
chris wood play good  
i love my kiwi striker

yipeee "
9533,Nottingham Forest,"For sure, without Sels I’d say we’d be in the championship right now "
9534,Nottingham Forest,"I totally agree with your sentiment but he (Wood) clearly had the skill all along. You're totally right about Nuno's approach and guidance bringing out the absolute best in him, but take nothing away from Wood, he was banging them in at Burnley and Leeds without ever getting the attention he deserved before us.


I saw him scoring a lot of those goals, but somehow still didn't think he was good to cut it with us when he arrived, because apparently, 40 years in as a fan, I still know fuck all.


I still feel guilty as fuck every time I think about his reception to our club. I don't know any Forest fans who actually believed in him at first. When he wins the Ballon d'Or and takes us into Europe, I'll be in a gulag somewhere eating my words.  What's wild is back here in NZ he's going to go down as our best ever footballer. He's on his way to beating the national goal record, he's been in the famous 2010 world cup side (that didn't lose a match 😅) and he's going to be there again in 2026 pending our (admittedly quite easy) OFC qualifying route.

He's a national hero for young kids here who play. If any of you have seen national games played here, he spends so long signing autographs and taking pictures with Kiwi kids waiting patiently. 

Despite living most of his adult life in the UK for his career, it's quite clear that he really wants to use his platform to lift the profile of football back home, where it started. I only hope we as fans here actually start to show up for them alongside the rest that play around the world. Im here for it in spades."
9535,Nottingham Forest,"Like...in the nicest possible way...Lineker at his best. Stick a ball in the box and he'll be there. It's mad with Wood though, because he shows time and time again that modern defenders apparently come unravelled quickly against an old fashioned centre forward. "
9536,Nottingham Forest,Wood **Wood**

9540,Nottingham Forest,"Think Ireland has the 3pm blackout 3pm blackout may be the worst thing ever created. They’re acting like the stadiums won’t still sell out if it doesn’t exist 🤣 wtf

James Connolly didn’t die for this"
9541,Nottingham Forest,"The River Bar on O'Connell Bridge is where the Dublin Arsenal Supporters Club meet. If anywhere is going to show it, that's your best bet.

9542,Nottingham Forest,"3pm blackout may be the worst thing ever created. They’re acting like the stadiums won’t still sell out if it doesn’t exist 🤣 It’s protecting the little guys. It’s all about non league and lower leagues not losing fans to watching manure at home on their arses. 

Saying that, we literally never sold out (unless Derby) till the second half of the 22/23 season so make of that how you will."

9545,Nottingham Forest,Good more Elanga for us. 
9546,Nottingham Forest,"Apparently he wasn't happy being left out of the first team so hasn't been getting called up because of it Very very immature from him. Tbh, I like elanga but he’s in no right to basically demand a spot. Yeah, and he skipped the last team dinner last call up, which made things even worse between him and the coach. Very unfortunate situation, and I hope he gets reminded that the other swedish players are playing too good for him to fit now and accepts it."
9547,Nottingham Forest,Good. Wouldn’t want him getting injured competing in that pointless Nations League competition anyway. 
9548,Nottingham Forest,Perhaps they left him out because he doesn't know how to score? 
9549,Nottingham Forest,Didn’t the Sweden manager have similar problems when he managed Blackburn. 
9550,Nottingham Forest,Swede manager said Elanga wasn't returning his calls. 
9551,Nottingham Forest,"Very very immature from him. Tbh, I like elanga but he’s in no right to basically demand a spot. Yeah I don't blame him because he's definitely got the quality to be in their team but that's not how to go about it. From a forest perspective I don't really care though, don't want him getting injured in a 6-1 win over Azerbaijan"
9552,Nottingham Forest,"Yeah, and he skipped the last team dinner last call up, which made things even worse between him and the coach. Very unfortunate situation, and I hope he gets reminded that the other swedish players are playing too good for him to fit now and accepts it. "

9555,Tottenham,I need that Deki IKEA sticker immediately. 
9556,Tottenham,Yiddo 
9557,Tottenham,Me and Chris go over the City win and talk about all things that begin with G to do with Spurs 
9558,Tottenham,£100 for 3? 
9559,Tottenham,"Lads, I think Ange might be right handed. Just a hunch tho. Idk, I am definitely not ambidextrous and my go-to is both hands in the air and a clap. "
9560,Tottenham,"His composure is honestly impressive. For someone who as a child woke up in the middle of the night to watch the Prem from Aus, and who only stopped playing FPL with his mates when he became an actual Premier League manager, handing City their worst home defeat in 20+ years and Pep the worst home defeat of his career has to be an absolute dream. Yet Ange is ice cold, like he expected to clobber them and that anything less would’ve been a disappointment. Nothing but a fist bump and a congrats to his assistants. 

This is the mentality of someone who wants consistent success and to not just get Spurs to the  top, but to keep them there for a long time. Back the man, he’s going to get us places. Absolutely. I admire his attitude. He is the kind of manager I would want to play for. That's why I'll follow him for the rest of his career. He was low key addicted to Football Manager when he was the manager for the Socceroos as well He's either into Stoicism or just naturally falls into line with that headspace because everything he says, the way he talks, the way he comports himself and especially the way the squad are talking and being is as if he has them all reading Ryan Holliday books like Phil Jackson used to give The Bulls reading material over the break between seasons."
9561,Tottenham,🗿✊ This gotta be a thing from now on  ✊🗿
9562,Tottenham,He’s a big fan of Jessie Owens 
9563,Tottenham,"Calm down Ange! Yeah, that third goal. He was almost out of control. Dude. As phlegmatic as a spittoon at a bronchitis convention."
9564,Tottenham,"Big up Ryan Mason in the background! 🙌🏼🙌🏼 Both of the Ryan masons. He’s got a bench full of em That was my favorite part What managers was he on the touchline for?  After Jose was sacked, he was coaching one of the youth teams when he got promoted right?  And Conte had him on his staff and then now Ange."
9565,Tottenham,✊ Dance like no one's watching with **one fist in the air**
9566,Tottenham,I thought it was the same clip repeating for a sec 
9567,Tottenham,"Not a single smile. 

I’m convinced Ange has got what it takes to win us trophies. 

And I’m also convinced he’ll leave as soon as his contract expires. 

All those people saying he isn’t good enough for us - truth is it’s probably the other way around, and the club needs to step up to match his ambition.  I think if things are going well and we've won a couple of things (Europa, Carabao, maybe an FA Cup or two) but not the Premier League and Champions League, he'll stay.

If he's won everything he'll go.

If we haven't won anything he'll go.

So I hope in three years when his contract is up he's won nearly everything lol.

If nothing else, he might want to live in one place for a while and there are many worse places for an Aussie to raise their family than London.

If we get two contracts and he's won the Premier League twice in a row at that point, maybe he'll just say *fuck it* and retire with us.

That's my dream at least."
9568,Tottenham,It's the same picture 
9569,Tottenham,"Now you’re gonna make me watch the goals again.

2m views already 🤣 https://youtu.be/eZoZIEISgBg?si=ogvgGfvjFR5fCdtc 5.25m as of 8pm 😂 Bastards we can’t even watch this in the states"

9572,Tottenham,"Fuck Conte, but his cam videos still give me goosebumps Yeah, I mean his moments were amazing, the Tuchel handshake is still making the rounds to this day That is one of the things I enjoyed about him was his passion.  And he really seemed to appreciate the fans."
9573,Tottenham,Reminds me of the Undertaker biker gimmick Keep rollin rollin rollin rollin
9574,Tottenham,I will personally fight anyone who is Ange out. 
9575,Tottenham,The fist of glory 
9576,Tottenham,✊✊✊✊ 
9577,Tottenham,Corporate wants you to find the difference between this video and this video and this video and this video. 
9578,Tottenham,City got their karma for laughing about being kicked out of League Cup. Pompous asses 
9579,Tottenham,Pep looked broken at the end there. My heart bleeds for him. 
9580,Tottenham,"hand up, turn to the staff, ""hell yeah,"" high-five, no smiling allowed until the final whistle "
9581,Tottenham,"That hand is really fast, he should be good at table tennis "
9582,Tottenham,✊ 
9583,Tottenham,We already have video of him when we win the Premier League. 
9584,Tottenham,Would be hilarious if the players did a goal celebration mimicking this 
9585,Tottenham,"Man I wouldn't day this about a lot of people, but I'd nuzzle Big Ange

Always love seeing Masons passion too! "
9586,Tottenham,Never playing poker against Ange 
9587,Tottenham,Love this man 🫡 
9588,Tottenham,You can tell everybody has been directed to treat every game like it needs winning and to stay humble by keeping it all on the pitch. Love the respect and love the step forward to a trophy. 
9589,Tottenham,"Idk, I am definitely not ambidextrous and my go-to is both hands in the air and a clap.  I like it, it's good to be unpredictable."
9590,Tottenham,Absolutely. I admire his attitude. He is the kind of manager I would want to play for. That's why I'll follow him for the rest of his career. 
9591,Tottenham,"He was low key addicted to Football Manager when he was the manager for the Socceroos as well Imagine how crazy it must feel to go from that to sitting in meetings with Levy and saying “I want Solanke because of his pressing characteristics” and then getting to sign him, start him, and then watching him play an integral part in their press to win big games in the Prem. 

Literally living his FM dreams."

9611,Tottenham,"Welcome to goalkeeping, Yang "
9612,Tottenham,I presume he can’t play til Jan tho he could be ready for United in the cup though. would be exciting Probably not but the sooner he can start training with the first team the better I guess maybe he wants to check out hyde park winter wonderland Can't they just add youngsters the B list prior to games for Europa League? I think it might only be PL games he can't play until January. 
9613,Tottenham,"Super exciting 

I hope people temper their expectations and give him plenty of time.

He's still very young, coming from a very different league - he may not hit the ground running and that's absolutely fine. he's got 30 seconds to prove himself Yeah look at Sarr and Udogie. Plenty of highs and lows but you can see that they have crazy ceilings. Odobert poor lad hasn’t even had a real chance to show us what he can do in a Spurs kit yet. But look, it even took Sonny a season and a bit to really hit the ground running and he was older and had been playing in Germany/Europe already. So expectations need to be super realistic. He’s younger than Sonny was in his first PL season and Son was not good his first season"
9614,Tottenham,I'd love to see the look on his face when they hand him a pair of goalkeeping gloves! 
9615,Tottenham,Can he play in goal? lmao
9616,Tottenham,"Might be an obvious statement, but I imagine the urgency here is related to Odobert seemingly out for still a while. Definitely can't hurt to have an attacking option, especially on the right wing where our best option behind Brennan is playing Kulusevski in a worse position (albeit he just had a masterclass there Saturday, we've seen him drop stinkers off the RW as well). If you look at what they did in attack, it was different than the typical Ange RW. Porro and Sarr covered the right wing in attack and let Deki roam. Deki was only a winger defensively "
9617,Tottenham,"if i remember correctly, he told korean media he’ll arrive dec. 12

not sure if he means he’ll land in london then or that will be his first day at the training ground "
9618,Tottenham,Bring yo’ gloves! 
9619,Tottenham,Get ready to learn Goalkeeper buddy 
9620,Tottenham,"I heard from my Korean friend that his reps said that they’ve already been to England to find a place for him to live. The Korean journalists asked if he’d be living near Son, and they said “no, too expensive” lol. But apparently the club has recommended him to a neighborhood where Bergvall and Archie are already. So if he does move there then he can hang out with his fellow teenagers and it’ll help him pick up English faster. "
9621,Tottenham,he could be ready for United in the cup though. would be exciting Can he be registered for that? I always though the FA cup would be his first chance
9622,Tottenham,Probably not but the sooner he can start training with the first team the better I guess 
9623,Tottenham,maybe he wants to check out hyde park winter wonderland 
9624,Tottenham,Can't they just add youngsters the B list prior to games for Europa League? I think it might only be PL games he can't play until January.  They have to be with the club for at least 2 years to make the B list for Europe.
9625,Tottenham,"he's got 30 seconds to prove himself If he doesn't score a hat trick with his very first touch of the ball, I want his contract terminated immediately. Unironically there'll be people calling him shit after 1 touch for the club. Someone only needed 18 secs last game!"
9626,Tottenham,"Yeah look at Sarr and Udogie. Plenty of highs and lows but you can see that they have crazy ceilings. Odobert poor lad hasn’t even had a real chance to show us what he can do in a Spurs kit yet. But look, it even took Sonny a season and a bit to really hit the ground running and he was older and had been playing in Germany/Europe already. So expectations need to be super realistic. Yea and it will realistically take him longer than Sarr and Udogie, who were both older and playing well in top 5 leagues. This kid hopefully gets a few sub appearances this season and goes on loan next season."
9627,Tottenham,"He’s younger than Sonny was in his first PL season and Son was not good his first season Plus Son had already been in Europe for seven years at that point. As cultural shifts go, it was surely a much smaller one."
9628,Tottenham,lmao 
9629,Tottenham,"If you look at what they did in attack, it was different than the typical Ange RW. Porro and Sarr covered the right wing in attack and let Deki roam. Deki was only a winger defensively  Yeah Porro was wider and inverted less. It was a good tweak as it allowed Deki to pick up the ball more centrally."
9630,Tottenham,Can he be registered for that? I always though the FA cup would be his first chance there’s no registration for either cup actually. just league and european football. There are domestic cup ties that prevent players from participating in it with two different teams though
9631,Tottenham,They have to be with the club for at least 2 years to make the B list for Europe. 
9632,Tottenham,"If he doesn't score a hat trick with his very first touch of the ball, I want his contract terminated immediately. "
9633,Tottenham,Unironically there'll be people calling him shit after 1 touch for the club. happened with kulu

9637,Tottenham,"Yeah Porro was wider and inverted less. It was a good tweak as it allowed Deki to pick up the ball more centrally. And when Deki was on the left side when they lost the ball, Solanke would defend as a RW and Deki would stay in Dom’s spot"
9638,Tottenham,"there’s no registration for either cup actually. just league and european football. There are domestic cup ties that prevent players from participating in it with two different teams though That would work for a free agent, but he is not our player officially until January 1.

At least that's how I understand the rules."
9639,Tottenham,"happened with kulu Oh man I remember that.  Cup game against Brighton.  ""Oh he's got no pace"" ""He's horrible"""
9640,Tottenham,"And when Deki was on the left side when they lost the ball, Solanke would defend as a RW and Deki would stay in Dom’s spot But people say Ange has no Plan B. Almost every time we have played City we have had some new wrinkle or formation in and out of possession."
9641,Tottenham,"That would work for a free agent, but he is not our player officially until January 1.

At least that's how I understand the rules. wouldn't he be our player since he was loaned out to the k-league club and returning and their season is over which suggests he's not their player anymore either. i don't know how it exactly works but that would be my guess."
9642,Tottenham,"Oh man I remember that.  Cup game against Brighton.  ""Oh he's got no pace"" ""He's horrible"" PEH too. After that 1st match against Everton everone though we'd signed a donkey."
9643,Tottenham,But people say Ange has no Plan B. Almost every time we have played City we have had some new wrinkle or formation in and out of possession. 
9644,Tottenham,"wouldn't he be our player since he was loaned out to the k-league club and returning and their season is over which suggests he's not their player anymore either. i don't know how it exactly works but that would be my guess. He wasn't loaned back, the transfer doesn't actually take place until the January window opens.

It's the fact Gangwon's season has ended meaning he join up with training early but he can't play until January 1st. If it's anything similar to Vuskovic, then no. Technically not our player loaned back, but in practice yes.

It's a silly and complicated contract, basically wording it so that we have bought him but we don't own his contract yet."
9645,Tottenham,PEH too. After that 1st match against Everton everone though we'd signed a donkey. That first match against Everton everyone played like a donkey.
9646,Tottenham,"He wasn't loaned back, the transfer doesn't actually take place until the January window opens.

It's the fact Gangwon's season has ended meaning he join up with training early but he can't play until January 1st. Yeah wasn't there an age law that meant it couldn't be an official transfer until he turned 18?"
9647,Tottenham,"If it's anything similar to Vuskovic, then no. Technically not our player loaned back, but in practice yes.

It's a silly and complicated contract, basically wording it so that we have bought him but we don't own his contract yet. yea i get that but the difference btw vuskovic and yang is that vusko is in an european league that is still in season and k-league has a different schedule than european leagues and the season is completely finished with zero games remaining across any competition which suggests yang is not their player anymore. my guess is he won't be able to play in PL & Europe matches until january but the Cup competition could be a different beast. we will see how the situation unfolds."
9648,Tottenham,That first match against Everton everyone played like a donkey. 
9649,Tottenham,Yeah wasn't there an age law that meant it couldn't be an official transfer until he turned 18? 
9650,Tottenham,"yea i get that but the difference btw vuskovic and yang is that vusko is in an european league that is still in season and k-league has a different schedule than european leagues and the season is completely finished with zero games remaining across any competition which suggests yang is not their player anymore. my guess is he won't be able to play in PL & Europe matches until january but the Cup competition could be a different beast. we will see how the situation unfolds. He can’t be registered with the club until January, so I don’t see any way he could play United in the cup.

It’s not a matter of registering for the cup, he still belongs to his Korean club and that can’t change until January."

9653,Tottenham,"Put up a clean sheet on Manchester City while playing 60 minutes on a broken ankle. Absolute legend. Plus both first choice CBs out. This is such an under appreciated point. It is insane he stayed on the pitch and played well. Start building the man a statue now! Exactly. Just give him a shot of adrenaline, whack an ice pack on his ankle, and get him out there. You’ll never sing that mate."
9654,Tottenham,"I know it's just social media comments, but this team seems so united and together. Brings a tear to my eye 🥹 "
9655,Tottenham,Jordans flu game or Vicarios broken ankle game? Kobe’s torn Achilles game. Didn't Son score 2 goals against Villa with a broken wrist?
9656,Tottenham,"I love the fact that all players, even those who just transfer to different teams, stay in contact. Namely, PEH and Emerson. They have such a good relationship. "
9657,Tottenham,"interesting that Udogie's message is in English rather than Italian Likely auto translated on OP’s end, because both his comment and Vicario’s response were in Italian when I saw them yesterday Udogies mother tongue is English"

9661,Tottenham,Beast! Big Vic! 
9662,Tottenham,Love seeing all the boys giving their support and even ones not on the team anymore.  That's one thing I really love about the club you often see past players commenting and giving support. 
9663,Tottenham,That's crazy that he played 60 mins injured and was this good. Forza Venom 
9664,Tottenham,"What an absolute legend, clean sheet with a broken ankle "
9665,Tottenham,"That 'Day 1' with the hourglass is amazing and pure Vic energy.  The whole physio crew, Ange, and the rest of the club are going to get him fit as soon as possible, because you know he's going to drive them crazy. You can tell he’s already bored. "
9666,Tottenham,"Long evenings of watching Tipping point, deal or no deal and then the chase for the next few months "
9667,Tottenham,He looks fine. Play him next game

9680,Tottenham,Udogies mother tongue is English 
9681,Tottenham,Guglielmo Vicario I still don’t get it
9682,Tottenham,You can tell he’s already bored.  I suspect he's going to help/annoy the goalkeeping coach a lot.

9686,Tottenham,If you haven’t made it to The Irish Channel in DC I would highly recommend it. DC Spurs are pretty fun and the bar is great for game days. Just got a DC Spurs jersey and it is great. Much more creative than the Nike kits and half the price too Any other DC area spots for Spurs you know of that are popular? I was there this weekend while visiting a friend in DC. What a great atmosphere and friendly crowd.
9687,Tottenham,Looks like a Banksy 
9688,Tottenham,"Why is the sticker yellow, black, and white? Different time zone"
9689,Tottenham,“Blue & White Army” doesn’t have the same ring to it as “Yid Army”

9691,Tottenham,Washington DC ey? Have you heard of a guy called Trump? He sounds the guy of guy that you either love or hate! 
9692,Tottenham,Just got a DC Spurs jersey and it is great. Much more creative than the Nike kits and half the price too 
9693,Tottenham,Any other DC area spots for Spurs you know of that are popular? Arlington Spurs are based out of [Ireland's Four Courts](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XES1omm4brZYNE6E7). Pretty nice spot to watch games (more spacious too!) as long as you're okay sharing the space with other supporters groups
9694,Tottenham,I was there this weekend while visiting a friend in DC. What a great atmosphere and friendly crowd. 
9695,Tottenham,Different time zone Ah yes. Makes sense

9702,Tottenham,Celine gets the gloves vs. Fulham 
9703,Tottenham,Why no footage of Forster doing this? 🤔🤣🤣 
9704,Tottenham,"Nah Kulusevski, I appreciate the competitiveness, but only the first 1 should count. You can anticipate the speed way easier when you have already done it once.

In conclusion, Dragusin is my champ 🏆 Celine is my champ."
9705,Tottenham,Why didn't Deki just do the second attempt first? Is he stupid?

9707,Tottenham,Bergvall looking clean 
9708,Tottenham,Can she play keeper? 
9709,Tottenham,Of course Deki can't accept the first attempt 
9710,Tottenham,Crazy that she used to be one of the most hated yters in my country. Happy to see she's getting the love she deserves. Her football content is always pretty chill. 
9711,Tottenham,Idk when they might have filmed this but I would've loved to see Vicario or our other keepers try this out! 
9712,Tottenham,"Kulu really said ""I understand now"" "
9713,Tottenham,Why does dragusin always have a great result in every challenge 😂 Bro is good at everything
9714,Tottenham,Timo looks the type to be in formula 1 if he had the reflexes. 
9715,Tottenham,Kulusevski being kulusevski (give him another chance and he’ll deliver) 
9716,Tottenham,i love how competitive Kulu is 
9717,Tottenham,You can't catch them with two hands. That's doesn't count 
9718,Tottenham,Celine is fit ya

9743,Tottenham,And one of those 11 played with a broken ankle 💪 
9744,Tottenham,He's gone full Garth Crooks.

9746,Tottenham,"Real Representation of above players-

Vicario

Porro . Kilman .

Lemina

Kulusevski

Saka- Odegaard- Maddison

Salah

Cunha- Pedro "

9758,Tottenham,"""Take Dejan for example.
I know who Dejan is.
If you think Dejan is Zlatan... No.
I know who Dejan is.
Dejan will run for 11 people.

So if you are Janne (previous Sweden coach) and like people who runs for the team, Dejan, he is the perfect example.

Everyone in Italy knows who Dejan is. 
He isn't the player that will score 20 goals. 
But he is the player that will contribute to 20 goals...
He is the guy who will run for 4 people."" Short of saying ""he's Zlatan"", which I doubt he'd say about anyone, that's about the highest praise I can imagine. obviously not the point but it’s amusing that zlatan says he’ll run for 11 people and then right after it’s “only” 4 people. just an aside since i know what he means. kulusevski has 3 lungs Im going to pretend that ""run for"" is a mistranslation of ""run through"" 

""Dejan will run through 11 people"" facts Zlatan ;)"
9759,Tottenham,That Dejan karate goal earlier this season was such a Zlatan goal 
9760,Tottenham,"I have actually never heard him speak Swedish before. The Scanian accent with Zlatan's persona is a really comedic juxtaposition. Does he have a Balkan accent in Swedish? I think I heard kulusevski does once Is the translation correct with ""run for 11"" then ""run for 4""?"
9761,Tottenham,Zlatan was rightfully extremely critical to our last coach a couple of years ago and I remember one example was this that he didn’t give kulu a spot. 
9762,Tottenham,Dejan has what it takes to be the next club legend and I hope Spurs do enough to keep him here until that happens. 
9763,Tottenham,Some high praise and it’s spot on. 
9764,Tottenham,I always wondered if Kulu would dominate as a triathlete? 
9765,Tottenham,ok but will he run for 4 people or 11 people Only zlatan can tell
9766,Tottenham,Vi älskar dig Dejan!! Stanna för alltid <3 
9767,Tottenham,"Short of saying ""he's Zlatan"", which I doubt he'd say about anyone, that's about the highest praise I can imagine.

9770,Tottenham,"Does he have a Balkan accent in Swedish? I think I heard kulusevski does once No. Both Kulu and Zlatan have a bit of a ""ghetto"" accent combined with their respective local dialects. Distinctly Swedish though. No -- he just speaks like a guy from Skåne. That particular dialect just sounds a bit, hard to think of an equivalent hhere, but definitely not what you think Zlatan would sound like. They both have like the Swedish equivalent of MLE, although Zlatan is from Skåne and Kulusevski from Stockholm, so there is a difference."
9771,Tottenham,"Is the translation correct with ""run for 11"" then ""run for 4""? Yes -- he is basically just saying the same thing twice with different levels of hyperbole.

There is one error in the translation above though, in the second line he isn't saying perfect example, he is saying perfect specimen."

9784,Tottenham,I think we are at the smog begins to clear part.. I think we need some more “late equalizers or winners” for that. Or at least follow up our amazing performance against a top side with a convincing one against a so-so side (Fulham). But I do believe we are nearly there! Hopefully… I actually agree with this more than what I said Let's circle back to this after Fulham I thought that after the Man U game. Hopefully this time it's true.
9785,Tottenham,"Something I find really interesting is the focus on the bad results at the moment and how that means Ange is a fraud. Let’s imagine we flip some of the results on their head and we beat Ipswich, Brighton and Place but we lose to Villa, United and City. Surely that would be more concerning because it would start to show we can’t beat our rivals? I think that narrative would suit the media better though because it would be “as expected”. Typical spurs.

I think what’s happening is that we are seeing that there is “method to the madness” and the smog is about to clear, like it mentions in the above. 

I also think the players need to take real accountability and treat every game like it’s a big game. The recent interview with Kulu where he talked about training hard and keeping a high level all the time was telling. We need all the players to have that attitude. 

I believe we are going places 🙏🏻 Would you prefer to be a team who has the capability of defeating man city at the Etihad 4-0 but needs to work on consistency?
Or would you prefer to be a team that consistently takes wins off Ipswich and palace but needs to work on how to beat top sides? Which one seems easier to solve? Love it. As far as your first point goes: losing to the lower league sides feels like it's in the mental/concentration, man management or form deficiency side of things. Whereas if we got results against lower sides and were blown out by anyone in the top half of the table then it would feel like a strategy or philosophy problem. 

If it was a strategy or philosophy problem, then Ange would logically need to go. If it's the former, then maybe it's growing pains, a young team, years of Spurs memes, tired legs, too many matches in top flight football, playing it out from the back under every awful circumstance, etc. Or perhaps it's just more space for Ange to grow as a manager. But there's no doubt that when the results are good, what's happening on the field is *exactly* Ange's tactics.

Seems to me we have a problem (judging by the totality of the past 6+ weeks) but it's the much *lesser* problem of the options. It just feels like the kinks are going to continue to work out, week by week."
9786,Tottenham,"> Certain players who were thought to be rubbish begin to find previously unimaginable levels of performance 

THE WERNER RENAISSANCE BEGINS. 

Man is going to score goals like he is Harry Kane or sth. Crazy how we already have Brenaldo now we’re gonna have Timodiñho too still waiting for ndombelessaince. It's been happening.  Brennan was getting slated left right and center and now he's our leading goal scorer.  Madders was getting stick, and he wasn't the same player and now he's tied with Brennan for PL goals.  Count Dragula turned in some poor performances and goes to the Dekihad and has a fantastic game.  Even in just that match Biss gets a yellow minutes in and we're like ""Great he'll get another and he'll be gone"" and he did an amazing job."
9787,Tottenham,"First they will ask you why, then they will ask you how "
9788,Tottenham,"I agree with you. I think we're actually seeing commentators use the exact words ""maybe he's onto something"" post City lol. On my feed Jim Beglin couldn’t stop talking about how anges system is flawed and he needs a plan b even as we were up 4-0"
9789,Tottenham,"Ask again after this week. If we go out and smash Roma and Fulham, the stew is starting to cook. Smashing Roma would have been defining if Mou was still there..."
9790,Tottenham,"Things are always darkest before the dawn.


I'm just not sure when the dawn is. I like to think the smog is lifting and the offensive side of Spurs is off the chain right now, and I still think we've yet to see the best of Solanke too.


I'm hoping things will start to click with the defence in the next few months and we start to dial in performances especially against weaker teams.


We're in a really weird scenario where if a team tries to play us we win, if they shut up shop they win. "
9791,Tottenham,"It's shocking how accurate this whole statement is, particularly the bits about being found out and needing a plan B immediately. It’s eerie, it really does read like a prophecy doesn’t it? Hope it plays out til the end!"
9792,Tottenham,WLWLWLWLWLW  <---- we are here You’ve got to be consistent.
9793,Tottenham,Which book is this? Angeball by Vince Rugari.
9794,Tottenham,"I’m not sure what stage you consider this. Losing to Ipswich followed by a 4-0 victory at the Etihad is an unheard of degree of variability. In any case, I think the latter result is more than enough evidence Ange should be trusted. They just need to go up one more level in mentality where they aren’t bothered by teams putting 10 players in the box. ? 


Losing to ipswich and beating city (and all relevant comparators) is what we've done as a club since Redknapp at least."
9795,Tottenham,I think we are at the posting snippets of his biography stage. 
9796,Tottenham,"I think that the narrative of the book isn't written word for word how it has happened in every team.

I mean more or less, but each team has unique issues. Ours is not the system, or Ange being called Naive anymore. Problem is consistency and it's not the tactics anymore. We legit lose when our players just do things way worse than usual, like awful passing, no confidence dribbling, major mistakes.

When we do all those technical and individual player things right the tactics are more or less fine.

So we gotta be somewhere between being called Naive, players who were thought to be shite (Kulu) finding form and also smog lifting.

Consistency and leadership. That's why I like Davies, Vicario and Son playing together. "
9797,Tottenham,"With Forster in, it may give us a lot of practice scoring late minute winners... "
9798,Tottenham,[the maybe phase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO_Se7ng6XQ) 
9799,Tottenham,"It's kinda crazy how relatable this seems to be, including how the media and pundits seem to be behaving. Ofc it's predictable and typical of them, but still.

Kinda sad that there's so many fans who haven't bought into his philosophy. Probably most are the kind that grew up watching early 2000s PL hoofball, or idolize managers like Mourinho. "
9800,Tottenham,"I think we’re at “certain players who were thought rubbish…”

Such as: Maddison if this weekend carries, Johnson, Kulu this season.

People forget we made the habit last season of being the “goals in final 10 minutes” matches. 

If we could stop losing to bottom 5 teams I think we reach that “creeping inevitability” stage "
9801,Tottenham,"I've seen every version of Angeball played so far, since his days at South Melbourne (before it was Angeball). 

You guys aren't far off. 

To me, what's most interesting though is that in his press conference Ange alluded to the fact that he's been reviewing how he also may need to communicate to the players or how maybe he needs to look at changing things up. Ange has always really, been a pragmatist. But he's been a pragmatist within his whole framework - that is, the framework of ""Angeball"". "
9802,Tottenham,I will run through the Berlin wall for this mfer and I haven't even met him 
9803,Tottenham,I am absolutely rock solid reading this chills
9804,Tottenham,Between 'blood' and 'clear'. 
9805,Tottenham,"I’m not an Ange-out guy but I’m still Ange-skeptical. 

Nonetheless, if he pulls through and puts in cup wins and title challenges I won’t complain. :) "
9806,Tottenham,"It's so over  
We're so back  
It's so over  
We're so back  
It's so over  
We're so back <-- we are at this stage "
9807,Tottenham,Acceptance 
9808,Tottenham,"Another thing that's telling is in all the losses they've been by a single goal.  If we were losing by 2 or 3 or more goals in those losses, then that would be a major concern.  In most if we just put away a few more chances they'd have been wins or draws.  It's just a consistency thing which only comes with time.  Injuries have not helped at all either and now we have to do it without our starting keeper.  But these guys have found ways to do it case in point at the Dekihad. "
9809,Tottenham,Hopefully an early one. There’s still a lot of work to do. 
9810,Tottenham,"I think we need some more “late equalizers or winners” for that. Or at least follow up our amazing performance against a top side with a convincing one against a so-so side (Fulham). But I do believe we are nearly there! Hopefully… Agreed, we need to turn those Brighton and Ipswich matches into draws or, like Brighton, maybe let them back in 2-2 but then find that last gear to finally get back ahead and then keep it. That's the next step. I think we had that last season. This year it’s little different for whatever reason"
9811,Tottenham,I actually agree with this more than what I said 
9812,Tottenham,Let's circle back to this after Fulham 
9813,Tottenham,I thought that after the Man U game. Hopefully this time it's true. 
9814,Tottenham,"Would you prefer to be a team who has the capability of defeating man city at the Etihad 4-0 but needs to work on consistency?
Or would you prefer to be a team that consistently takes wins off Ipswich and palace but needs to work on how to beat top sides? Which one seems easier to solve? The consistency is much easier to solve in my opinion. We are proving what we are capable of, and it’s not just lucky 1-0 wins, it’s 3+ goals. Consistency is Ange’s problem to solve because that’s what we need to be great team. I think it will come though. Fulham is huge, I think we’ll get the monkey off our back. We had exactly that under Poch. We beat all the mid-table and lower teams comfortably, with rarely a hiccup. We beat the top sides at home regularly too, but very rarely beat them away or ever looked like doing. This is better because we know we are capable. If you can beat City 4-0 at the Etihad then it’s not unreasonable to also expect to beat Ipswich and Palace. It shouldn’t be either/or. And it doesn’t need to be. I think the fans have a responsibility for to expect consistency to come with quality we’ve shown."
9815,Tottenham,Love it. 
9816,Tottenham,"As far as your first point goes: losing to the lower league sides feels like it's in the mental/concentration, man management or form deficiency side of things.

9829,Tottenham,"The consistency is much easier to solve in my opinion. We are proving what we are capable of, and it’s not just lucky 1-0 wins, it’s 3+ goals. Consistency is Ange’s problem to solve because that’s what we need to be great team. I think it will come though. Fulham is huge, I think we’ll get the monkey off our back. "
9830,Tottenham,"We had exactly that under Poch. We beat all the mid-table and lower teams comfortably, with rarely a hiccup. We beat the top sides at home regularly too, but very rarely beat them away or ever looked like doing. This is better because we know we are capable. "
9831,Tottenham,If you can beat City 4-0 at the Etihad then it’s not unreasonable to also expect to beat Ipswich and Palace. It shouldn’t be either/or. And it doesn’t need to be. I think the fans have a responsibility for to expect consistency to come with quality we’ve shown. 
9832,Tottenham,"if only. can't think of many players less suited to Ange's ethos. well ange and ndombele are both fat, cant think of a better common are for these two, BRING HIM BAC"
9833,Tottenham,up 4-0 against against the 4 year reigning PL champions. Without our 2 first choice center backs. Yeah Ange really needs to stop the naivety already. 
9834,Tottenham,"Didn’t Spurs lose to Fulham last year immediately after that Villa rout? Yes, and didn't score a goal against them after scoring in like 20 something matches before that,  I think."
9835,Tottenham,"well ange and ndombele are both fat, cant think of a better common are for these two, BRING HIM BAC "
9836,Tottenham,"Yes, and didn't score a goal against them after scoring in like 20 something matches before that,  I think. Everything is fine."
9837,Tottenham,Everything is fine. 
9838,Tottenham,"Tempering my expectations - Lucas B looked world class in the comps from the league he was in. I’m excited about this signing, very excited, but like Lucas, Moore and our other youngsters, I’d assume it’ll be a year or two before we really start to see them. 

Signing young players to grow in the squad is always a good decision either way! If we see them at all. People need to remember that young players don’t develop linearly. They can hit a point where they just aren’t going to get any better and they don’t work out. Signing young players is always a gamble. If it pays off, you’ve saved 30+ million. If it doesn’t pay off then you’ve lost 30 million instead of the 60 you’d have spent on an established player. Buying Young players can be beneficial, but it’s also a problem. Instead, we should be focusing people on people who will have an immediate effect, not prospects for the future"
9839,Tottenham,"I've said it before, but I have Mitoma levels of hope for him and that he transfers these Korean League highlights into Premier League performances. He’s already a better ball striker than Mitoma"
9840,Tottenham,I like that he does the Sonny turns showing how much influence he's had over youngsters in Korea. 
9841,Tottenham,It’s hard to not fall in to the compilation trap. I do feel like a lot of time and care went in to this decision though. Sonny’s valuable opinion certainly being a part of it 
9842,Tottenham,First time bangers from outside the box at 0:58 and 1:05 are crazy strikes. 
9843,Tottenham,"I’m really excited. His finishing is really solid. Seems to have a natural talent to put the ball in the net which can’t be understated. Honestly not sure if that’s something that can be taught, some players don’t have it as we have seen… Other than that he also looks clever with the ball at his feet and pretty creative. 

He’s definitely going to struggle with the physicality and pace in the premier league. A lot of his game seems to rely on those little runs he makes on the wings after he fools the fullback and takes a heavy touch to chase. That’s not gonna work in the PL. He’s not explosive enough to blow by defenders. If his dribbling gets as clean as Mitoma’s I can see it, but he’s not another Son type winger that can blow by people when there’s space. Definitely another Bergvall level potential talent where you can clearly see it’s all there it just needs to come together and he needs to stay confident "
9844,Tottenham,"If this kid isn’t starting and banging goals by February, I’m going to be upset at Levy. "
9845,Tottenham,"If we see them at all. People need to remember that young players don’t develop linearly. They can hit a point where they just aren’t going to get any better and they don’t work out.

9846,Tottenham,"Buying Young players can be beneficial, but it’s also a problem. Instead, we should be focusing people on people who will have an immediate effect, not prospects for the future Focusing on players that have an immediate effect is a good way to stay average. Players that are already at the level to raise the status of the club are not cheap and more importantly are in demand from clubs like the Real's, Bayern's etc.

The way to break the cycle is to get the right young talents in. The challenge is how difficult that is."

9849,Tottenham,"Obviously still shit but not as bad as some of the estimations suggesting it could be 4+ months. Interesting what the club do with a backup planned for summer anyway. Wonder if they move ot forward or if he's back in Jan/Feb anywya they just hold off  What's the FA rules about him playing with one of those protective boots?! just slap some studs on the bottom and you're good to go surely! Who said surgery, yet? Does that include resetting a bone? Do people call that surgery? Simple Fracture is always 6 weeks+"
9850,Tottenham,"If he truly broke his ankle and required a plate and screws construct (vs a ligament avulsion fracture that can be treated more like a sprain), he'll be nonweightbearing for likely a minimum of 6 weeks. If he injured his syndesmosis (ligament complex between your tibia and fibula around your ankle, involved in high ankle sprains) and needed additional fixation for that, it might be 8 weeks before putting much weight on that leg. Then you factor in rehab ie range of motion, strengthening, proprioception, balance, etc and you're looking at least 8-10 wks before return to play. And that timeline is assuming all goes well from a healing perspective, which isn't guaranteed given the foot/ankle and it's shitty blood supply. Personally, I'd be shocked if we see him before February and more expect him closer to March based on what limited info we have and what's most common with ankle injuries. 

Source: I'm an orthopaedic surgeon This makes me curious, how was he able to play for 12+ min with an ankle fracture? Is it because goalkeepers don't need to run that much? Wouldn't it have hurt like hell? Having suffered many ankle injuries myself, surely it’s at the minor scale if he was able to play on it for an hour?"
9851,Tottenham,"Am I misremembering or did Forster have a spell in the team a couple of years ago when Lloris got injured and was pretty solid.

Reserve keeper is a very tough gig. Basically play the odd Cup game and never settle into a rhythm. I reckon he'll be alright with a run in the team. The issue is his ball playing out from the back, which is much more important in Ange’s system Forster took over after the Newcastle game that was a disaster In terms of shot stopping it’s not a bigger gap than you’d see at other clubs between first and second choice. The problem comes when we have possession and when we’re pushed up high, Vicario was very involved in the back line and did a lot of moving and ground passing. Something Forster seems less suited for, that’s where the larger falloff is gonna come from"
9852,Tottenham,"Gee, that's a much better timeframe than I would have guessed. "
9853,Tottenham,"Not all ankle fractures require surgery, only the more unstable ones so its probably closer to 10 than 6. The post has taken into account he had surgery, not just its an abkle op 6-10 is based on that"
9854,Tottenham,"By my estimates, he'll be back by 27 Jan (9 weeks)... Missing 11 league games, including Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool.  


 
But, you never know... He might be back in 6 weeks (in time for Arsenal on 15 Jan...maybe even Newcastle, 4 Jan?)


Edit - but what does this mean, for our league prospects?? I'd suggest that there will ZERO negative impact.  


Why am I coming out with this crazy talk? Consider the facts: 


1) nearly every single league game that we've won...we done it by 3 or 4 goals.  (There was one match, spurs 3 - 1 Brentford, where the margin was 2 goals).


2) we are getting better at playing the Ange system, and ange is starting to play some more pragmatic tactics. 




So let's assume that Forster concedes on average, 1 more goal per game than Vicario..  my conclusion is that it won't matter. 


In fact, we will actually get BETTER over the next 11 PL games, due to broader improvements across the team / changing tactics. This makes sense if you consider there’s no mental impact of conceding first. 

Reality is that despite his flaws Vic makes some incredible saves. Even against City, Haaland early attempt would’ve gone in if it wasn’t for Vic and the game could’ve gone very differently. Yeah we win by 3 or 4 goals because vic makes 3-4 great saves per game lol Can't believe I typed ""we done it by...."".  Lol.


Can't be arsed to correct it on my mobile phone though...Rddit is just too painful to use."
9855,Tottenham,Not bad 
9856,Tottenham,"There’s are two injuries he likely suffered based on where he was favoring and the fact that he finished the game. Both could be managed non-op, so I’m thinking back to practice by early Jan, hopefully game ready by Leicester or Brentford. He's had surgery though? "
9857,Tottenham,We have to remember this is Tottenham where 10 weeks turns into 4 months 
9858,Tottenham,"I just hope the rest of the team steps up with that press, i have complete faith in them and especially in Forster. This is where the team and Ange will shine. Back the manager and the team, game by game and we know they can do it, we have to shout even louder COYS COYS COYS and help push the team on "
9859,Tottenham,Where's Michel Vorm when you need him! 
9860,Tottenham,Fuck it. We ride. 
9861,Tottenham,"What's the FA rules about him playing with one of those protective boots?! just slap some studs on the bottom and you're good to go surely! Fucken hell, even though this is sarcasm I winced on reading this That’s the spirit!"

9865,Tottenham,"The issue is his ball playing out from the back, which is much more important in Ange’s system Particularly if playing with Dragusin, who also struggles in this area. and that he's 36 now... I don’t think he’s that bad at playing the ball from the back. I mean Joe Hart handled it at Celtic, and by no means Vicario was good at playing out from the back. 

I’m more jarred by his penalty shootout performance against Fulham. Other than that.. I believe in the lads And getting down on low shots to the corner. Especially near post low shots, he can’t get down quick enough."
9866,Tottenham,Forster took over after the Newcastle game that was a disaster

All we can do as fans, is cheer on the team. 👍 Bruh, of our last 15 league games at home we've conceded first in 12 of them. We beat Man City 0-4 but it could’ve easily been 3-4"
9870,Tottenham,Yeah we win by 3 or 4 goals because vic makes 3-4 great saves per game lol True! Haha 
9871,Tottenham,"Can't believe I typed ""we done it by...."".  Lol.

9874,Tottenham,That’s the spirit! 
9875,Tottenham,"The club statement said he had surgery yesterday. Thanks. Must have read it half asleep. I thought they just said he was being treated for a bone fracture, so assumed cast, big boot etc. I was expecting no more than 6-10, based on him finishing the game."
9876,Tottenham,Adrenaline's a hell of a drug 
9877,Tottenham,"Particularly if playing with Dragusin, who also struggles in this area. Exactly. Teams are going to know when and where to press us and we’re going to have limited options to get out. 

Perfect example was the galatasaray game - Forster and Dragusin were shocking playing it out Spurs are doomed if Cuti and VDV are not back soon. Starting a backup GK and the third and fourth choice CBs is something no club can survive without dropping spots in the table."
9878,Tottenham,and that he's 36 now...

I’m no doctor, but I don’t think surgery makes too much difference in recovery time for an ankle break, when compared with muscular surgeries."
9887,Tottenham,"Exactly. Teams are going to know when and where to press us and we’re going to have limited options to get out. 

Perfect example was the galatasaray game - Forster and Dragusin were shocking playing it out There may be times when we just have to hoof it long. I hope Ange can see that these two just can't do this the same as Romero and Vicario can. 

If we're pressed too badly, just hoof it. If we lose the ball trying to hoof it to Solanke, no worries, our pressing the other team will win us the ball back."
9888,Tottenham,Spurs are doomed if Cuti and VDV are not back soon. Starting a backup GK and the third and fourth choice CBs is something no club can survive without dropping spots in the table. I want to get off Big Ange's wild ride.
9889,Tottenham,"I think Vicario’s passing ability was known even at Empoli. Good point on Hart though, he did specifically note how ange helped him in that respect at Celtic I thought Vic’s passing was always considered weakness compared to his other abilities?.. maybe I’m mistaken."

This is one thing I really wish we did more. Yes, our first goal against City was a long buildup. But the other 3 were the result of pressing and/or turning the ball over. Often we are much more efficient when we *don't* have the ball. So get comfortable kicking it long. Maybe you win the ball and then start something. Or, you lose it and immediately press, trying to turn the ball over and start something. I don't think it's anathema to ange-ball to send it long sometimes, because the press is just as important (maybe more so) than the build up."

I love watching us play right now and I rarely bothered with 4.30am matches under Conte. Now I'm usually up before 4 I'm so excited. I'm like a kid at Christmas with the time difference for these matches lok. 

I also think it's not going to be as bad as some folks here suggest.

You'd think Forster had never saved a goal for us the way people are talking. He made a couple of pretty important ones against Galatasary for example. 

He's not as good for Angeball, sure. But we can compensate for his deficiencies and play to his strengths.

Big man.

Hands like frying pans.

9901,Tottenham,Merlin? It is a Topps brand
9902,Tottenham,Love it. Big fan of the Merlin set. Can’t wait until we are back in it next release. Had a couple bale autos from the set but had to sell when money was tight. 
9903,Tottenham,It is a Topps brand 
9904,Tottenham,Gonna be a wild ride But I’m here for it Trust in Thanos
9905,Tottenham,"Needs to keep the burner low and not immediately crank it up to high.

But I'm afraid he's constitutionally incapable of playing out from the back. Wouldn’t be surprised if we end up getting a few more long balls out to Solanke and play a little more old school football. The team would need to be ruthless at chasing after the second ball if it doesn’t stick to Solanke. I feel like I read that we are one of the most successful teams playing it short from the back."
9906,Tottenham,"I have an unreasonable amount of faith in Forster. I think he’ll start shaky but will gradually get better with consistent game time. I’ll always remember how clutch he was during Conte’s last season I think he will be fine in defense. But I'm not sure we can execute Ange's defensive plan with Forster, Davies, and Dragusin on the ball. None of them are confident or skilled enough with the ball at their feet to provide some relief when playing out of the back.

But I think we will be fine defensively. We may need to focus more on shutting up shop, I'm hoping Ange can adjust. Score first and defend from the front He was so trash against galatasary When"
9907,Tottenham,Don’t the boys often say that Fraser is the funniest guy in the dressing room? Personally I think it would be hilarious if Fraser turned in to prime Buffon these next few matches… He has the beard for it.
9908,Tottenham,Big hands! Big saves!
9909,Tottenham,Not gonna lie. There's someone in a white shirt blurred between his legs and for a second I genuinely thought it was his giant cock pocking out from his underwear. Like the kids show Big Cock Little Cock Me too bro me too
9910,Tottenham,Big man! 
9911,Tottenham,Full English on a raging hangover. 
9912,Tottenham,"To cook or be cooked? That is the question we’re all dreading right now. Please heal with haste Vic! Healing with Haste won't work, try healing with Lay On Hands"
9913,Tottenham,Yes Chef! 
9914,Tottenham,"If the club didn’t think he could take over, then he wouldn’t be there. Vicario managed to play an hour, so the break must be at the minor end, sometimes surgery speeds things up. I reckon he’ll be back by February. I'm assuming 3-4 months for my own sanity's sake It's the loss in match fitness as well you need to account for. Vicario will take a few weeks getting back to full form once his physical fitness is 100%.

Fuck this fucken sux."
9915,Tottenham,"This is where we will need to win 5:4 every game Lol.

The best way to keep a clean sheet is to go full blown attack and possession where the other team doesn't even get the ball."
9916,Tottenham,"His distribution will be ok, pretty damn good when he can start from holding, maybe even spark some counters off a long throw. and he’ll stop shots but worried about him getting down to cover the low posts  "
9917,Tottenham,"How are his corners? Probably the only part of his game that is a straight upgrade on Vicario, he's pretty imposing Bloke is a fucking man tower and built like a brick shithouse, I can't see anyone trying the shoving shite on him"
9918,Tottenham,"Fraser isn’t a bad keeper at all, and has some attributes over Vic with his presence and strength in the box. We just have to pray Ange doesn’t force him to play like we do with Vic and we got a bit more direct/long ball, Frase ain’t got Vic’s feet and that’s not his fault. "
9919,Tottenham,He's gonna be the guy because the rest are young and inexperienced.  I wouldn't be surprised to see us playing more compact kind of like how we did against City with the fullbacks not so high up to help out since he's not a sweeper keeper like Vic is.  As I've said before if we play the way we're capable of he shouldn't have a lot to do. 
9920,Tottenham,"I'll back him. Let's go Forster, he will do well "
9921,Tottenham,More like we are cooked💀. 
9922,Tottenham,He surprised me in the European games so I hope he'll do alright! I'm definitely confident he won't cost us (many) goals 
9923,Tottenham,"I’m sorry but we need cl football, is Austin not ready? Or we just slack "
9924,Tottenham,Why is your userna… you know what I don’t wanna know What’s his userna… yeah why did I scroll back up.

9926,Tottenham,As long as he avoids the butter... 
9927,Tottenham,After the coventry game & the 1st half against galatasary i have no faith & can see us not winning a domestic game until January. 
9928,Tottenham,I think Fraser is as good a shot stopper tbf. It’s just his playing out from the back that worries me but I think once he gets a couple of games into his belt he’ll be good. He’s definitely not a bad keeper! 
9929,Tottenham,We're so cooked 🤣🤣🤣 
9930,Tottenham,I trust this big guy 
9931,Tottenham,"I think I'm in the minority in thinking that Forster is not terrible playing out of the back under Ange. It's not that we demand the world out of either him or Vicario, it's just about maturity, composure and (like Joe Hart said recently) understanding your options dynamically.

The bigger concern is that Vicario is massively overperforming his expected saves I believe. Our defending will have to improve significantly, particularly box defending, because Vic won't be there to bail out the back four. "
9932,Tottenham,just worried if we have a good enough back up for him incase he gets injured 
9933,Tottenham,Fax! Hes been good eveytime hes started 
9934,Tottenham,"As long as he doesn’t have too many penalties to face , he was decent for us in Europe "
9935,Tottenham,We need to bring someone in. 
9936,Tottenham,You either are a teenager or have teenagers.

Score first and defend from the front I thought Davies passing at least was phenomenal against city. Always looked calm and cool and consistently found the correct outlet with precision. That was against an extremely skilled and organized press. I hope he can keep it up Weird because 2/3 of those blokes just kept a clean sheet against city, and fostered a 4-0 win."
9944,Tottenham,"He was so trash against galatasary Was it AZ that he had a good game? Forster far down the list of blame for the Galatasaray game. Galatasary he did OK. That stadium was brutal on all our players, as expected.

He made some fairly important saves that match."

The best way to keep a clean sheet is to go full blown attack and possession where the other team doesn't even get the ball. "
9954,Tottenham,"Probably the only part of his game that is a straight upgrade on Vicario, he's pretty imposing "
9955,Tottenham,"Bloke is a fucking man tower and built like a brick shithouse, I can't see anyone trying the shoving shite on him "
9956,Tottenham,What’s his userna… yeah why did I scroll back up. 
9957,Tottenham,"Honestly, with the way we play against teams lower down the table, that would probably be a very effective way to mix things up. Like back in the Poch days when we went for route one to bypass the midfield."
9958,Tottenham,"I thought Davies passing at least was phenomenal against city. Always looked calm and cool and consistently found the correct outlet with precision. That was against an extremely skilled and organized press. I hope he can keep it up Davies actually is a tidy passer of the ball. And he's decent at dribbling forward in a straight line or making that inside forward pass and run from fullback. I think he's actually a pretty decent backup fullback in Ange's system, given his utility and seniority in the squad.

But Davies is not great at possessing the ball under pressure or dribbling out the back from centerback. I think this is why he was shifted more towards fullback in his career and can also do a job as an outside centerback. As the more progressive and technical partner in a back 2 with Dragusin, Davies leaves a lot to be desired in that role."
9959,Tottenham,"Weird because 2/3 of those blokes just kept a clean sheet against city, and fostered a 4-0 win. Ba dum"
9960,Tottenham,Was it AZ that he had a good game? Yes.
9961,Tottenham,Forster far down the list of blame for the Galatasaray game. Yes.  The first goal was a thunderstrike that most any keeper couldn't have gotten to.  And defensive miscues are always rough to deal with for any keeper as well.
9962,Tottenham,"Galatasary he did OK. That stadium was brutal on all our players, as expected.

He made some fairly important saves that match. "
9963,Tottenham,"Haha, great reference. "
9964,Tottenham,We found the Paladin 🗡🛡 
9965,Tottenham,I fear its a ‘slow burner’ injury that lasts until the end of the season.

As the more progressive and technical partner in a back 2 with Dragusin, Davies leaves a lot to be desired in that role. I think he ended up where he was (at that time) was because he wasn't physical enough for a midfield destroyer type or a CB, but he was technically too good to play at CB (from the pov of the English game). 

It's his consistency, and the shift towards a back three and playing out from the back, over the last decade, that landed Davies as a jack of all trades."
9968,Tottenham,Ba dum 
9969,Tottenham,Yes. 
9970,Tottenham,Yes.  The first goal was a thunderstrike that most any keeper couldn't have gotten to.  And defensive miscues are always rough to deal with for any keeper as well.

9972,Tottenham,He’s usually so rational and level headed. This seems off. He doesn’t seem like the type to lash out at others when things aren’t going well for him. Mate he’s always been a bellend but if you compare him to Liam then he looks sane

Also, he's not completely wrong for predicting we'll lose to Fulham this weekend. Be positive, we will win 4-1"

‘They’ll get battered by Fulham at the weekend, no problem. But they always turn up for us.
‘I wasn’t expecting to win that game, I certainly wasn’t expecting to lose but 4-0 was a shocker.’ I don’t understand how that even makes Spurs frauds. Is everyone supposed to capitulate to the mighty citeh? Are little old Tottenham supposed to fear them and go into a low block and not try to score?

The harsh reality of it is Manchester City will always be our bitch, no matter where they are in the world of football, no matter who their manager is or the players they have or the circumstances involved, I will always feel that we will beat them because we can.

It's also why I will never consider them a club in the same magnitude as either Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United or Chelsea. Shit I am more worried about us playing West Ham than them. "

1) There's a typo in the title of the Table Position graph.  
2) Since you already have the data from last season's graphs, can you add the 22/23 Table position data so we can see how we are progressing compared to the last pre-Ange season?

Thanks again for all the work you put into this! "
10036,Tottenham,It's because we lose the seemingly easy games and apparently demolish the difficult ones 
10037,Tottenham,"A less talked-about improvement this season is Vic's passing ability. There are very few keepers in the league I'd trust with the ball at their feet more than Vicario. 

I think the drop-off from Vic to Forster in playing out the back could be the biggest issue we face during Vicario's absence. Forster has had some good shot-stopping performances but his ability to pass under pressure has looked shaky in every appearance so far It’s his vision for passes which stands out a lot imo. He has a great sense for where people are on the pitch without looking, something a lot of midfielders don’t even have. 

The pass to Sarr at around 55secs is perfect. Literally cuts through their press and takes us half way up the pitch instantly. Have not seen him play at Celtic under Ange but surely he must have learn something about playing in the back."
10038,Tottenham,"The haaland save at point blank range with his right hand in the second half didn't get enough credit in commentary Neither did the one with his right foot either. That’s some serious reflexes and reactions to get down so fast. Agreed.

The pundits keep going on and on about Haaland not being clinical. 

I think that one is a case of Haaland taking a very good shot that is normally a goal but Vic just made an incredible save on it. 

Also, the chance in like the 10th minute of the game where Vicario saved Haaland's shot from about the penalty area with his foot (kick save). I've seen Haaland do that same shot many times where it's a goal, but Vic was just too good.

Vicario should be getting a lot more credit from the pundits than just ""oh, Haaland wasn't clinical."""
10039,Tottenham,"Jojo-esque performance. Severe organ damage and high blood loss (well, not quite but you get me), still moves with incredible precision, agility and strength "
10040,Tottenham,How lucky are we that we ended up with Vicario immediately after Lloris. I love this man. 
10041,Tottenham,This injury hurts us the most bar maybe Kulusevski. Where is Kulu? Is he safe? Is he alright?
10042,Tottenham,"a big miss, was brilliant at the weekend. "

10074,Tottenham,"I watched this movie somewhat recently as it was on cable. It's really hard to watch those A's glory runs now with everything that has happened to the team recently. 

What I had forgotten is how much of a period piece it is, all the technology and cars and clothes from the early 2000s, which didn't feel THAT long ago when it came out. If you're from the Bay Area, they just did an excellent job capturing the sights and sounds from that era. Now it feels pretty dated, excellent nostalgia from what feels so long ago. RIP Oakland A's and the Coliseum, I'm glad some of your energy is preserved in this film. I know American sports generally don’t have the same sense of community as European sports clubs but seeing the reaction to losing their stadium was so hard to watch. It’s also sad that the universality of data based recruitment doesn’t leave space for underdogs to find gaps in the market like this I don't follow baseball. What happened? Did they get relegated? Yayareaaaaaaaaaa Watching it recently alongside the 2003/2004 redsox documentary knowing how Beane was so close to coming to Boston that year gives an extra level to how influential he was and how close to getting it all he got Are you a Spurs and A's fan?

It’s also sad that the universality of data based recruitment doesn’t leave space for underdogs to find gaps in the market like this The A's did not lose their stadium. The ownership decided to relocate after decades of underinvestment.  It's pretty similar to an MK Dons type of situation, except everything is just macro in the US compared to England. Instead of a small move from Wimbledon to Milton Keynes, this would be more like Villa upping stakes from Birmingham and deciding to relocate to Monaco. 

And it's not just the football club. Oakland has repeatedly been kicked in the teeth in the last decade. The Town lost the Raiders, lost the Warriors, and are now losing the A's, all of whom at one time occupied the same arena complex.  Homelessness spiralled out of control, the pandemic shocked the Bay Area job market, ineffective police, meanwhile housing costs skyrocket. The economy just isn't functioning in Oakland, income inequality is stark, and major business players are leaving. > I know American sports generally don’t have the same sense of community as European sports clubs but seeing the reaction to losing their stadium was so hard to watch.

It's why I really struggle nowadays to get excited about Franchised sports. As an Australian.. that kinda sucks because almost all of our professional sports are franchised. I love watching the lower leagues of our sports, particularly football, and understanding the involvement from the community that helps those clubs succeed. 

Imagine having your team just up and move to the other side of the country.. a country as big as say... Australia or the US. What a joke. Incredibly sad to see what has happened to the A's, and how for the sake of greed they ran a team into the ground to force a move away from it's community. Oakland A's fans must be hurting... I hope they can really get behind the Oakland B's in the Pioneer League, but I understand the attachment they'll still have with the A's... what a internal conflict that must create :( One place you’ll find it is Green Bay, Wisconsin. The team is still publicly owned. It’s the smallest city in America to have a professional sports team (just over 100,000 people). The city school board decided to start school a week earlier than the rest of the state this year because Green Bay is hosting the NFL draft and they are going to give the kids the week off for it."
10101,Tottenham,"I don't follow baseball. What happened? Did they get relegated? Hahaha nooo, there is no relegation in baseball. But there is also no salary cap similar to soccer. This means that there are teams with owners that invest crazy amounts and always win (Dodgers, Yankees) and there are teams that are perennial bottom feeders bc the owners don't invest (A's, Rays). 

Hence, Billy Beane and statistics based sports analytics. If the A's could deliver the same statistical results while spending less, they could be successful. Beane and his Ivy League quant nerds changed the game, and now that influence is being expanded to all sports. From an American perspective, it's hilarious that you all are still having the debate around data analytics. The only reason it's still a debate in soccer is that the scores and stats are so low in absolute value that sample size becomes an issue for analysis. Baseball, on the other hand, lent itself to this approach as everything is a statistic and quantified. There are 165 games a season, 5 at bats per average game, and 5-10 pitches per average at bat. The team is getting moved to Las Vegas. I don't follow baseball either, but there's no relegation in MLB. Nor the NFL, nor the NHL, MLS, ad nausea. Relegation isn't ""Murican."""

10108,Tottenham,"Same here. I know nothing about baseball, but I watched this movie 3 times. Brilliant movie. Personally I think it was a little short.. Was just getting into it when it abruptly ended..."
10109,Tottenham,"Haha, the Johnon G Werner A combo is pure moneyball Watching Timo smoke Kyle Walker ... by that stage I was just laughing."
10110,Tottenham,Ah fuck he beat me to it 😂 
10111,Tottenham,"Man, re-reading that thread is funny.

The fear about not signing an attacking player.

I think Solanke joined a week later and then Odobert not long after that. "

""Exactly.""
""Five years ago, Werner, big name. Been in a lot of big games. Now he's an offensive liability, we'd be lucky to get five goals out of him. Why do you like him?""

""He gets into the box."" wish I had an award to give you for this ""He gets in a cross!?""

He gets in a cross. Excellent"
10114,Tottenham,"That Werner low cross to Johnson tap in feels like when you’re playing a sweat on fifa and they’re spamming the same unstoppable move While I enjoy Johnson starting well enough, the super sub pairing of Werner and Johnson against tired legs is the dream."

10116,Tottenham,"The A's did not lose their stadium. The ownership decided to relocate after decades of underinvestment.  It's pretty similar to an MK Dons type of situation, except everything is just macro in the US compared to England. Instead of a small move from Wimbledon to Milton Keynes, this would be more like Villa upping stakes from Birmingham and deciding to relocate to Monaco. 

And it's not just the football club. Oakland has repeatedly been kicked in the teeth in the last decade. The Town lost the Raiders, lost the Warriors, and are now losing the A's, all of whom at one time occupied the same arena complex.  Homelessness spiralled out of control, the pandemic shocked the Bay Area job market, ineffective police, meanwhile housing costs skyrocket. The economy just isn't functioning in Oakland, income inequality is stark, and major business players are leaving. The state of ... Everything.... Is so depressing these days, as a kid I couldnt wait to be an adult living my best life and now im just... Troubled by it all Just watch Eddie Izzard’s stand-up about the movie The Rock and you’ll see how even 10-15 years ago it was heading that way

“Oakland? OAKLAND??? No-ones going to pay [a ransom] for f***ing Oakland!”"
10117,Tottenham,"> I know American sports generally don’t have the same sense of community as European sports clubs but seeing the reaction to losing their stadium was so hard to watch.

It's why I really struggle nowadays to get excited about Franchised sports. As an Australian.. that kinda sucks because almost all of our professional sports are franchised. I love watching the lower leagues of our sports, particularly football, and understanding the involvement from the community that helps those clubs succeed. 

Imagine having your team just up and move to the other side of the country.. a country as big as say... Australia or the US. What a joke. Incredibly sad to see what has happened to the A's, and how for the sake of greed they ran a team into the ground to force a move away from it's community. Oakland A's fans must be hurting... I hope they can really get behind the Oakland B's in the Pioneer League, but I understand the attachment they'll still have with the A's... what a internal conflict that must create :( What's terrifying is to watch the franchis-ification of collegiate sports in the US.  College football is the closest to the tribalism and intense regionalism of European soccer. People are very emotionally connected to their school, let alone the football team. Obviously the large universities that compete in football have strong local/regional ties, public schools being directly tied to the state. 

But now our once regional conferences are being ""re-aligned"" to ensure that the teams that draw the most TV viewers are all compiled into one or two national scale conferences. A ""Super League"" if you will. They all schedule each other and leave the smaller programs behind for enhanced TV revenue contracts. You need the TV revenue in order to pay to recruit the best players, who are no longer amateurs and sign large contracts to play at big programs.  The only thing left is to divest the football team from the university completely. Let the profitable programs run on their own and the rest of the programs will simply fold, as they cannot afford to compete with the Super League without substantial subsidy from donors or the university budget."
10118,Tottenham,"One place you’ll find it is Green Bay, Wisconsin. The team is still publicly owned. It’s the smallest city in America to have a professional sports team (just over 100,000 people). The city school board decided to start school a week earlier than the rest of the state this year because Green Bay is hosting the NFL draft and they are going to give the kids the week off for it. "
10119,Tottenham,"Hahaha nooo, there is no relegation in baseball. But there is also no salary cap similar to soccer. This means that there are teams with owners that invest crazy amounts and always win (Dodgers, Yankees) and there are teams that are perennial bottom feeders bc the owners don't invest (A's, Rays). 

Hence, Billy Beane and statistics based sports analytics. If the A's could deliver the same statistical results while spending less, they could be successful. Beane and his Ivy League quant nerds changed the game, and now that influence is being expanded to all sports. From an American perspective, it's hilarious that you all are still having the debate around data analytics. The only reason it's still a debate in soccer is that the scores and stats are so low in absolute value that sample size becomes an issue for analysis. Baseball, on the other hand, lent itself to this approach as everything is a statistic and quantified. There are 165 games a season, 5 at bats per average game, and 5-10 pitches per average at bat. Idk if I’d call the Rays perennial bottom feeders, they’ve been rather consistent since ‘08 and have had only 5 seasons with a losing record since. Rockies would be a bit more apt. But the way baseball playoffs are set up the top teams cannot always win

Dodgers finally won one after winning the shortened season in 2020, Yankees haven’t won it since 2009, last year the Rangers won it all for the first time, 2022 was won by nobody bc the Astros need to be fired into the sun and yuli gurriel should be drawn and quartered, in 2021 the Braves won it all for the first time since 1995"

10121,Tottenham,"I don't follow baseball either, but there's no relegation in MLB. Nor the NFL, nor the NHL, MLS, ad nausea. Relegation isn't ""Murican."" It has nothing to do with it being American and everything to do with how the leagues developed. Basically all pro sports in the US were regional and grassroots to begin with. College sports were much bigger at the beginning of the 20th century.

There were several competing baseball leagues that were all trying to establish themselves as the top league. There were a lot of free agent players moving between leagues and clubs for higher salaries. Clubs would also drift between leagues depending on geography, finances, and incentives. The original ""National Agreement"" in 1903 was a group of teams that basically agreed to honor each other's contracts and to stay in the league the following year. This created a framework where positions in that league were highly valued and they didn't want to disrupt membership."
10122,Tottenham,"I'm actually a Giants fan but my mom's brothers are A's fans so I've always had a soft spot for the A's. I lived and went to college in the East Bay, spent a good amount of time at the Coliseum.  Really sad to lose the A's, largely because of the lost rivalry with the Giants and that Bay Area baseball history. Yeah, definitely a loss for the Bay Area as a whole. I grew up in the East Bay but now in New England, and so many people out here feel terrible for me and the A's fanbase. I'll keep rooting for th Giants though!"

10144,Tottenham,"Data from [https://understat.com/league/EPL](https://understat.com/league/EPL)

I highlighted Fulham since they are our next opponent. They are massively underperforming based on expected points/goals/goals-against. 

Bournemouth, whom we play after Fulham, are also underperforming their expected scoring and position.

So, both of these games are not gimmes, which, gimme or not, does not matter in the case of Spurs.   
  
Also, as always, and as with any statistic, xG/xGA might not be very useful for evaluating performance in a single game. However, they are good indicators when examining performance over a longer period. Fulham have also had the easiest schedule. Their remaining matches before the halfway point are the clubs in 6th, 5th, 4th, 1st, 20th, 3rd and 13th. (Bournemouth has had the reverse with 17th, 6th, 13th, 14th, 12th, 19th and 9th left to play.) Is there six points there? 

  
Oh Dejan hear my prayer... Lose to Fulham, beat Bournemouth. Didn't realise there was an alternative. There's no such thing as gimme with Spurs. 

Ipswich and Palace both notched their only wins of the season against us."
10145,Tottenham,This also suits my agenda that Brighton is way higher than they should be. I’ve seen quite a few of their fans sticking up their ugly little heads lately and wouldn’t mind a little humbling for them.  
10146,Tottenham,"Doesn't the fact that almost everyone scores and concedes less than XG show that XG fundamentally overestimated the probability of a goal? Re-read your comment: Yes it seems to do so.  
  
However, it shouldn't affect the comparative analysis. If you take these metrics in absolute terms then yes, they are not entirely accurate. However, the ""correct"" way to look at them is in relative terms, e.g Spurs are more clinical than Everton in converting their chances, or Spurs (Vicario :\~( ) are better than Wolves in denying goals when the opportunities fall to the opponents. There are more ways to interpret this of course.

Think about it this way, I could easily apply a correction to make the scatter plot be centered around West Ham. This would still not change the relationships between teams. It would also not change the Expected Ponints/Table. I do think XG is a flawed metric if you are using it to predict anything except how clinical players are. If for example versus city, Johnson had slid right past the ball that Werner cut back instead of scoring, it would have counted for zero XG despite it being a great chance. Yes"
10147,Tottenham,"Shows how wild this season has been so far when you can go from 3rd to 8th in one match, or from 13th to 6th It's not usually this tight at matchweek 12"

10149,Tottenham,Trust the ~~process~~ regression to the mean. 
10150,Tottenham,"It'd be nice to live in this alternate ""expected"" universe where we're above Arsenal and Chelsea.


But I think Fulham in 2nd would be too wild for that universe to really exist! You would think, but as u/carpie21  noted, Fulham had a relatively easy first half of the first half season, so they could have had a much better position if they were more clinical. An incoming run of tough matches, however, predicts that they will never make it there :)  
Remember, this table is not a prediction for the future, just how things could have been if all chances were converted in the expected rate."
10151,Tottenham,"Why not put the positive in the top right like a normal graph? I struggled a little with this decision. Initially, I had it as you suggest, but in the end, I decided to switch it to this.

The reason for that is that I am not sure which one is better (and therefore should be on the top right). I think, it's really subjective.

Is it better to overperform your stats, which may mean you are consistently more clinical?

Or is it better to underperform your stats, which may mean  that you are better than your current position, you may have bad luck, and that the law of averages will dictate that you will overperform your stats in the future?"
10152,Tottenham,"Fulham have also had the easiest schedule. Their remaining matches before the halfway point are the clubs in 6th, 5th, 4th, 1st, 20th, 3rd and 13th.

E.g. one should also account for future strengths/weaknesses of schedule as u/carpie21   pointed out above.

Agreed. A shift is not necessarily the best  (or even a great) correction, however,  it is the fast and easy thing to try for amateurs like me.

10188,West Ham,"The track back, the speed, the desire, the hang time before the slide. Inject it into my veins!! "
10189,West Ham,“Not bad for a right back” 
10190,West Ham,"It's easy, if we get like 2 points per game on average until Christmas, we are very good.

If we get 1 or less, it's still going to stink.

If it's in between... Well I don't know "
10191,West Ham,"Last night was a great performance and if we carry on at that level to Christmas I’ll start to reassess BUT we have been largely terrible up until then and actually extremely lucky ( Man U, Palace and Fulham all lucky points). He’s bought himself some more time, that’s all. I don’t know we’ve been largely terrible, not great obviously but we’ve played 6 of last year’s top 8 teams already we had a tough start to season. 

Man U was very lucky, Fulham we deserved a draw and luckily got it late and palace we outshot them in shots and shots on target it’s hardly lucky. Then add in fulham and palace put 5 in against us in both corresponding fixtures last season. 

Of course we’ve had some terrible performances but not largely terrible. Everton, Chelsea and Tottenham were utterly pathetic, Liverpool are playing extremely well but not an excuse to ship 5 to them in league cup. I agree. We've been carved open many many times this season. If we show some character, and a bit of identity, over the coming weeks up to Christmas he'll get the majority of fans of his back I'd imagine.
For me, I would like a new manager, but the urgency of that will fall away if we can string some games together without giving away so many gilt edged chances! Last night was fun. More of that please! ⚒️"
10192,West Ham,"Sorry, I know this isn't a productive comment, but the Everton scoreless draw was such ass. True, but very close to winning late on. 

7 points from 9 in last 3 games at home and 3 points last night. Upwards ⚒️😁 For sure, I’m not even saying lop is good just there is no dire need to fire him"
10193,West Ham,"I think the issue is more with the performances and with the lack of any real ‘philosophy’ being on display than with the points as such.

Last night was the first time we have played well for more than half a game and I think there were signs of better, more entertaining football.  If we can string a few games like that together then there won’t be many complaints.  

After the Arsenal games we have four very winnable games out of four, and the other is only Brighton.  We should be aiming for 10-12 points from those games and if we do that we will be well placed in the league. "
10194,West Ham,"If we lose like rubbish to Arsenal without any efforts, ppl will demand his head again. Let's wait. Arsenal are a very good side I’d expect to lose, of courses no effort would be a horrible follow up after yesterday but it’s not going to get him fired."
10195,West Ham,"Onwards and upwards, here’s hoping we’ve turned a corner! "
10196,West Ham,The circle of life for poor performing managers... Do shit > Pressure of being sacked > Get a result or two > Buy more time > Do shit > Pressure of being sacked.... Rinse and repeat 
10197,West Ham,"I’ve said all season that good teams make average and bad teams look bad.  If you lose 3-0 it’s a given it was a bad performance.  Given that our 6 losses are all to teams  currently in the top 8, we should expect to be made to look bad much of the time. 

This theory took a big hit when we looked awful against Everton, but I think maybe they aren’t as bad as their place in the table might indicate, but also we should have had been able to score against them in a home game and we didn’t. 

Anyway, now I’m back to being comfortable with my theory.  It will truly be out to the test in the coming weeks when we finally play some bottom half teams. Your theory still works when you factor in bad teams have good days or lucky days, we had a lot of luck against man utd for example. But it also says something when a bad team has one of those good days and we still hold them to a draw I think too. That Everton game was very even for how poor we were all the stars are even they may have looked like they dominated but almost every stat is completely even, again very poor day by us that day (and too many others) but we walked away with a point not lost all 3"
10198,West Ham,"Worth noting the 5 game form table has us 10th. There's not a lot in it.

And obviously this doesn't account for performances. Both United and Newcastle we rode our luck, United we should have been 4 down at half time. And both of those were our best performances of the year.

As others have said, the biggest issue is lack of style or system being apparent. I would add the insistence of using the wrong players in the wrong positions - notably Rodriguez. 

Until the last game, the complete lack of a defined style was a huge problem. Without that, what are we sticking with Jlo for? He has really pulled a rabbit out of the hat with that coming through at last in Newcastle. For a team under pressure there was a lot of confidence.

We need to see a decent performance, even in defeat, against Arsenal. So a lot of hard work to put for that one. 100% agree I’m not Saying lopetgui should be safe and we are gonna win the title. There are of course very worrying aspects but im willing to give him the season to see if he can work it out, and not change managers half way through who the new manager would then need to rebuild to get people he wants for his tactic. We aren’t in real danger of relegation I know some are panicking but we have already opened up a more than 6 point gap from the relegation zone (7 and 11 points from 18&19th) after having one of the toughest starts to the season. There are terrible teams which will afford us the ability to be patient and see how lop is going by end of season if he still hasn’t implemented a recognizable identity or system we can make a smoother move to a new manager instead of panicking now. 

We know Sullivan has never spent a penny on manager compensation so firing lop now isn’t going to get us some great manager doing well elsewhere we will get an out of contract manager again."
10199,West Ham,"If you watch the games you can see the weaknesses and how vulnerable we are, regardless of what a table says. I’ve never said we were a perfect team did I? I watch every single game if you are in UK it’s very likely I watch more games than you. I never said we weren’t vulnerable I’ve said nothing of the sort"
10200,West Ham,"What is the different philosophy because the football looks exactly the same as late Moyes era We have a lot more of the ball now. Last night vs Newcastle away last year was a stark difference. 

Last night we made more passes than we even attempted Newcastle away last season. Moyes tactic is fuck the football and let’s try and knick one on a counter, lop tactic is to try and hold the ball and dictate the play yes it hasn’t worked but it’s nothing like Moyes. 

Last years game against Newcastle they completed 180 more passes than us and last night they completed 35 more. It’s nothing alike in saying that it’s also not like it’s miles better either"
10201,West Ham,"I don’t know we’ve been largely terrible, not great obviously but we’ve played 6 of last year’s top 8 teams already we had a tough start to season. 

Man U was very lucky, Fulham we deserved a draw and luckily got it late and palace we outshot them in shots and shots on target it’s hardly lucky. Then add in fulham and palace put 5 in against us in both corresponding fixtures last season. 

Of course we’ve had some terrible performances but not largely terrible. Everton, Chelsea and Tottenham were utterly pathetic, Liverpool are playing extremely well but not an excuse to ship 5 to them in league cup. We have absolutely been largely terrible this season.

However last night was great, let’s hope we can now kick on We didn’t deserve a draw at Fulham. We were horrendous"
10202,West Ham,"I agree. We've been carved open many many times this season. If we show some character, and a bit of identity, over the coming weeks up to Christmas he'll get the majority of fans of his back I'd imagine.
For me, I would like a new manager, but the urgency of that will fall away if we can string some games together without giving away so many gilt edged chances! Last night was fun. More of that please! ⚒️ "
10203,West Ham,"True, but very close to winning late on. 

7 points from 9 in last 3 games at home and 3 points last night. Upwards ⚒️😁 "
10204,West Ham,"For sure, I’m not even saying lop is good just there is no dire need to fire him "
10205,West Ham,"Arsenal are a very good side I’d expect to lose, of courses no effort would be a horrible follow up after yesterday but it’s not going to get him fired. "

>I watch every single game if you are in UK it’s very likely I watch more games than you.

Don't be childish. I've got a season ticket, I go to pretty much every game but I don't need to throw it in people's face as though it means anything, just so I can try and force my point."

Let's see what the next 5 games bring"
10210,West Ham,"We have absolutely been largely terrible this season.

However last night was great, let’s hope we can now kick on "
10211,West Ham,We didn’t deserve a draw at Fulham. We were horrendous Maybe you’re right deserve might be a bit too high praise if you want to call it that. But we weren’t so far of it a draw was ridiculous

Let's see what the next 5 games bring Shit woeful in 11 out 12 games and 4 points of 5th, can’t wait until we play just average then No clear starting 11 is a huge improvement over last year. Why have a squad of 25 if you are always playing the same 11 guys (and also almost never making subs, either)?"
10214,West Ham,Maybe you’re right deserve might be a bit too high praise if you want to call it that. But we weren’t so far of it a draw was ridiculous 
10215,West Ham,"Shit woeful in 11 out 12 games and 4 points of 5th, can’t wait until we play just average then I'm not even trying to piss on anyones parade here.

If we play like we did last night for the rest of the season then we're in the running for Europe.

Being 4 points off 6th isn't anything to do with how we're playing, thats a reflection on how tight the league is - we're not talking about a few places here, its jumping a whopping 8 places in the league!"

10218,West Ham,A true Hammer. The hammerest hammer hammering we have
10219,West Ham,"Love the guy, not the most skillful, but gives his all every game. The hate he gets on here by some pisses me off tbh. "
10220,West Ham,Superman Soucek! 
10221,West Ham,Can’t wait for my potato salad dinner tonight in honour of him 
10222,West Ham,"Super Tommy.

Already at Ludo levels of love to be honest. "
10223,West Ham,The hammerest hammer hammering we have 
10224,West Ham,Not to mention a Soucek header from a corner! We are so back
10225,West Ham,"Say what you will about JL and his start to the season… he got today 100% correct. With starting line up and timely subs. 

Idk if it a fluke…

Or a start to something new..

I remember when we collectively agreed to give him until December/Christmas to enact his plan…. He still has 3-ish weeks. 

If he can take this and turn what we did today into a regular thing… he’ll have earned a bit of time. Even if we lose to Arsenal, if we show this same level of fight…I’ll give JL a benefit of the doubt that he is creating something worth paying attention to Get that rationality out of there"
10226,West Ham,"under moyes, scoring a goal is the cue to for every man to take up residance in our own box. we saw none of that. we stuck with the high line, squeezed the game, took control of midfield and ultimately bossed them 

genuinely can't remember the last time we did that to a half decent side. When we beat Liverpool a couple years back. 

However today opposition had had lots of chances today and wasted them. That's fine and I'd rather be lucky than good any day but we are still weak while in possession because our backs tend to be displaced when we lose the ball. 

I think we are still set up to not keep the ball but idk if I'm misreading our strategy."
10227,West Ham,"Lopetegui looks already 10 years older than this picture Hey you, you‘re finally awake. You were asleep for the last 10 years. JLo turned it around, we won the prem, Sullivan sold the club, and Bowen is the new owner. Got you some tickets for the CL finale this year, gotta defend the title Wouldn’t be the first manager we nearly killed, and I’m convinced was Avram Grant was already dead."
10228,West Ham,Moyes version of less possession was 20-30% even at home. That was 48% away. Moyes would have had the team sitting back after going one up and we’d all have been having heart attacks during the second half. Sitting back after being one up was the best case scenario last season. Most of the time it was go one nil down and sit back anyway
10229,West Ham,"We are currently 1 point better off than last season after 12 games. I've not been happy with our performances so far, but let's give our new Manager a chance.

He wouldn't have been my choice to replace Moyes, but unless it looks like we're going to be relegated he deserves a season at least. "
10230,West Ham,"That was nothing close to a Moyes performance. 

We had 48% possession not sub 40%

We attempted 474 passes and completed 390 (82.3%) to Newcastle 499 attempted and 425 completed (85.2%)

Same match last year: we attempted 379 passes and completed 266 (70%) to Newcastle 558 and 446 completed (80%)

Or another way to look at it last season Newcastle completed 180 more passes than us that night and tonight they completed 35 more


We never wanted the ball under Moyes we attempted fewer passes last year at st James park than we completed tonight. We completed 11 more passes tonight than we even attempted under Moyes. "
10231,West Ham,"Lol under Moyes, we would have sat back after that 1-0 lead and lost the game 2-1 in the end. Who can forget last year's 4-3 fumble... "
10232,West Ham,We are officially massive 
10233,West Ham,That’s one of our best ever managers 
10234,West Ham,Fck me  you lot are so determined not to give Moyes any  credit at all... 
10235,West Ham,I did feel during this game that this was a classic Moyes performance. Can anyone convince me that I'm wrong and that there are differences? Sure 48% possession vs 18%.
10236,West Ham,We are so back Hope we keep winning 🏆
10237,West Ham,Get that rationality out of there 
10238,West Ham,"When we beat Liverpool a couple years back.

10240,West Ham,"Wouldn’t be the first manager we nearly killed, and I’m convinced was Avram Grant was already dead. On the other hand, I often felt Moyes looked better during his time here"
10241,West Ham,Sitting back after being one up was the best case scenario last season. Most of the time it was go one nil down and sit back anyway 
10242,West Ham,Sure 48% possession vs 18%. What is the 18% you're comparing it to?
10243,West Ham,Hope we keep winning 🏆 
10244,West Ham,"And our star striker is still injured Wait, we bought a striker?"
10245,West Ham,"On the other hand, I often felt Moyes looked better during his time here "
10246,West Ham,What is the 18% you're comparing it to? Literally every match we won under Moyes against a big 7 side?
10247,West Ham,"Wait, we bought a striker? It’s still Danny Ings"
10248,West Ham,Literally every match we won under Moyes against a big 7 side? And lost
10249,West Ham,It’s still Danny Ings 😂
10250,West Ham,And lost … that too.
10251,West Ham,😂 
10252,West Ham,… that too. 
10253,West Ham,"We need more of this Paqueta if we wanna go anywhere up the table. No more of that faffing about with shitty backheels and lobs and delayed passes I’ll take it all, honestly. I dread the day he leaves"
10254,West Ham,"I think the rotation between the three of them was causing Newcastle serious problems figuring out who to mark. I was confused myself. Soler started as the 10, but at times Soucek and Paqueta were both there.  

I definitely think Soler and Paqueta both earned another start.  It does seem a shame that Summerville seems more likely to be benched when Kudus return now, though I suppose the Arsenal game could change that. A very fluid midfield. Soucek and Soler both regularly around the box when you might have expected one or both to be sitting deeper.

We looked a lot better in build up and going forward, I would imagine as a result of the much improved midfield. Still shaky at the back and rode our luck. Todibo and Kilman did a good job covering any breaks and were comfortable on the ball under pressure. I'd have expected them to be more exposed with a rotating midfield.

Interested to see if we do the same v Arsenal or opt for something more defensive. I don't think we'd be quite so lucky against a better side."
10255,West Ham,"Paq/Soucek/Soler has to be the midfield from now on Yeah, I know a lot of fans love Guido Rodrigues because he's a world cup winner or whatever, but it's evident that he's simply too slow for the Prem. It's interesting to see if Lopetegui feels compelled to put Alvarez and Kudus in the starting XI."
10256,West Ham,His best game in ages ⚒ 
10257,West Ham,"We are too dependent on him.
If he has a good day we can win against anyone. If he has a bad day we lose. "
10258,West Ham,"Not playing a double pivot is the key. We don't need a number 10, two central midfielders in front of a defensive midfielder. 


It's less about the personnel and more about the shape of the team.  Paqueta has been playing well for a few weeks but has been scapegoated.  "
10259,West Ham,I see he's getting back into form ready for the January transfer window! 
10260,West Ham,The goat Just to clarify: I’m referring to his beard
10261,West Ham,I genuinely think when Paqueta is playing against his compatriots (Bruno and Joe) he ups his game. U could see the intensity of his press when either of them were on the ball. 
10262,West Ham,He’s a beast 
10263,West Ham,"Did anyone else think he still gave the ball away far too easily at times? I mean, it was a much better performance than what we are used to but there were still a good number of very frustrating moments for me. Perhaps I just have it in for him. "
10264,West Ham,He had a point to prove against his mate Bruno and definitely won the midfield battle 
10265,West Ham,"I’ll take it all, honestly. I dread the day he leaves "

It's interesting to see if Lopetegui feels compelled to put Alvarez and Kudus in the starting XI. I can't say I know many west ham fans that love Guido, he's been so bad Guido just doesn't have the pace for the Premier League - he's been given time (more than enough time) to try and adapt and it just isn't happening. I'm sure that he's a very adept player in a league that allows for more time and flair than the prem, but he's out of his depth here, and I think he knows it, which is why he's already pushing for a return overseas. I  actually think that Alvarez struggles with the pace still as well, only with Alvarez he's off pace to the extent that he fucks up the timing of his tackles and gives away a boatload of fouls, whereas with Guido he's so off-pace that he utterly tears open our entire midfield. I don't know who the fuck as been telling you they love him, haha. 
 
Honestly, with the form they've had this season so far, I don't think that Alvarez or Kudus *should* be straight back in the starting XI. I know a subsection of fans love to bash Soucek for some reason (even though I think he's proven time and again that he's our lynchpin in midfield and has never phoned it in for us), and I know Mo was our golden boy last season, but I honestly don't see how with their current form either one of them is an upgrade on the starting XI we sent out last night.
 
Kudus has forgotten that he has teammates and has literally cost us more goals than he's contributed to this term, and Alvarez has been collecting yellow cards like they were Panini stickers (which, to be fair, he did last year too, but at least last year he had the chops to back it up when he wasn't banned, but I'm not seeing that this year)."

10271,West Ham,"We don't need to force Alvarez back in, but Kudus should immediately start. Summerville was electric last night. I like kudus but he doesn’t get his head up enough. I think he’s earned his spot for now."

10273,West Ham,The circle of life. 
10274,West Ham,"Oh yeah the fans thinking their team is the absolute worst. Tell me about it. Everyone in Poland is so over the top whenever the national team looses. You can always hear ""We need to terminate our football association"" after we lose to Portugal or someone like that I dread to think about the reaction when you lost to Scotland, then. Rioting?"
10275,West Ham,"Put the arrow a cm to the right and it's more accurate imo. We had moments where we fucked up and almost got punished, and moments where we passed the ball to Antonio, which begging to get hit on the counter

On the positive, Soler and Paqueta marshalled the midfield, with Soler in particular bossing the play. Antonio, when he went wide, looked more like a footballer and Summerville was just off the chain. Some good building blocks to work with now "
10276,West Ham,"I dread to think about the reaction when you lost to Scotland, then. Rioting? Well first of all we HAVE to fire our current coach (it's the 5th one in the last 5 years) then fire everyone in the association. Then we have to degradate ourselves to the lowest division out of respect to the opponents and pray that San Marino will spare us

Seriously tho it's always these type of fans that have no idea about football and would just watch a game every 3 month when our national team plays. Only to see them lose and write online how all the players should get a real job and stop stealing our money or something like that

There's always some true to that but some people are exaggerating so much I'm surprised they're not getting bored"

10278,West Ham,"For those not blessed with 7 year long memories, this is in reference to Wilson's handballed late equaliser that was ruled out by the lineo but ruled back in by the ref.

https://www.skysports.com/football/bmouth-vs-west-ham/report/373287

https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11743/11185865/watch-a-little-touch-of-magic-helped-with-late-goal-says-bournemouths-callum-wilson Was it 7 years ago? It feels like it was last week - especially the interview. Why does this make me so irrationally angry. Fucking hell I miss Ginge. Loved Cheik so much too. This really was a great era despite the fact we were a bit shit post-Payet Yeah I would’ve had more sympathy if it was any other Newcastle player that Mavro took down 😂"
10279,West Ham,Antonio is reffed like he’s prime Shaq. It’s absolutely ridiculous what other teams get away with when it comes to Antonio. Agree with this. The last few years in Europe he got absolutely nothing despite teams intentionally grappling with him and pulling him to ground. I always thought Premier League refs were a bit better at calling it but this season it’s like every week is a Thursday night ref. If Isak was on the receiving end of that physicality last night we’d have had 5 in the book He does flop a lot depending on the game.
10280,West Ham,"Mavro is attacking the ball, Wilson is only trying to win a penalty.

Half think that's why it wasn't given, was more interested where the defender was than the ball. "
10281,West Ham,"Slow mo replay makes it seem way worse. I felt that was soft. Defo no pen Agreed.  As draped on him as he appears, at regular speed there doesn’t appear to be much force behind it.  The ref had let numerous similar fouls against Bowen and Antonio go, so while this may or may not be good refereeing, it’s at least consistent."
10282,West Ham,"You are right, disgusting intentional elbow into Mavropanos, surprised he didn't get done for violent play "
10283,West Ham,Makes up for the one they got last season! 
10284,West Ham,"According to ref analysis on Talk Sport tonight, Wilson was offside anyway. That's how he got the wrong side of Mavro. "
10285,West Ham,Just a friendly hug 
10286,West Ham,Offside anyway so doesn’t matter And the ball was over his head by the time Wilson initiated contact. No pen all the way round.
10287,West Ham,Is this really not a foul or it’s a foul? I’m confused 
10288,West Ham,Was it 7 years ago? It feels like it was last week - especially the interview. 
10289,West Ham,Why does this make me so irrationally angry. 
10290,West Ham,Fucking hell I miss Ginge. Loved Cheik so much too. This really was a great era despite the fact we were a bit shit post-Payet 
10291,West Ham,Yeah I would’ve had more sympathy if it was any other Newcastle player that Mavro took down 😂 
10292,West Ham,Agree with this. The last few years in Europe he got absolutely nothing despite teams intentionally grappling with him and pulling him to ground. I always thought Premier League refs were a bit better at calling it but this season it’s like every week is a Thursday night ref. If Isak was on the receiving end of that physicality last night we’d have had 5 in the book 
10293,West Ham,"He does flop a lot depending on the game. If he powers through it, he doesn't get a call.  If he goes down, he doesn't get the call because he went down easy.  Strength is punished instead of rewarded in this league."
10294,West Ham,"Agreed.  As draped on him as he appears, at regular speed there doesn’t appear to be much force behind it.  The ref had let numerous similar fouls against Bowen and Antonio go, so while this may or may not be good refereeing, it’s at least consistent. "
10295,West Ham,And the ball was over his head by the time Wilson initiated contact. No pen all the way round. 
10296,West Ham,"If he powers through it, he doesn't get a call.  If he goes down, he doesn't get the call because he went down easy.  Strength is punished instead of rewarded in this league. Yeah I'm not sure if he gets frustrated and does it or what. I don't think there's a right answer in terms of getting calls.  There's just some games when he could hold the ball and falls instead and it's frustrating."
10297,West Ham,Yeah I'm not sure if he gets frustrated and does it or what. I don't think there's a right answer in terms of getting calls.  There's just some games when he could hold the ball and falls instead and it's frustrating. 
10298,West Ham,I can feel either a 4-1 defeat at home to arsenal or a 3-1 victory I don’t know why I just know that it won’t be close 
10299,West Ham,Forever blowing JLo? 
10300,West Ham,"Wow! One half decent performance and he’s all good?.. let’s hope it carry’s on before we name a stand after him welcome to football fans on the internet, where a player / manager can go from zero to hero and back again all in the same week"
10301,West Ham,"Maybe J-Lo has hit his sweet spot. 
Not sure how it came to be but it was a relief that the defense was tight and kept their form which had a lot to do with the win, and on the attack, it was good ball handling with short precise passes. Looked like a team for the first time this year. I’m with Guilty-Definition-63 on Friday’s match prediction, either a 3-1 win or a 4-1 defeat. Either way, I won’t be surprised. "
10302,West Ham,"This girl I'm trying to shag did tell me Mercury was in retrograde. I didn't believe her. She's into astrology apparently have you never heard of the saying ""don't put your dick in crazy""? https://www.ismercuryinretrograde.com/"
10303,West Ham,Gonna need a lot more wins and better looking football before I fill one of those out. 
10304,West Ham,The way we played tonight compared to how we have played the rest of the season they should be apologising to us.  
10305,West Ham,"I am more interested if we can continue a train of thought moving forward than the win today…

Sure. We smash and grabbed a first goal, typical West Ham fashion… and then we actually spent time in the attacking third for once after that…
It was fun to watch, but it’s a few squeaky bum moments, but ultimately we played very much like a Moyes team wouldn’t. And that is something we should appreciate. It was nice to see a game out without being completely bombarded like it was under Moyes. The crowd were doing the olés at the 89th minute as we passed it about.
Ings even got a couple of chances to make it to 3."
10306,West Ham,"..... or maybe he should have just been coaching this way since the get-go. it was a very good display of what kind of football we should be playing, ball handling time management and set plays were key. "
10307,West Ham,Bruh we still have arsenal to play on Saturday 
10308,West Ham,Am printing off and signing as I type 
10309,West Ham,"I’m on Bet365 on us 3-1……. You called it…… oh if I lose you owe me tenner, yeah? "
10310,West Ham,"I missed the game. How did we play overall? I seen the highlights West Ham posted but doesn’t give the full picture x Played very good. Not prime Barca as some fans expect from this new project, but beat the Saudis away and did so with class and hard work."
10311,West Ham,I’ve backed him since day 1. Hate these “fans” who betray our players and managers. 
10312,West Ham,One swallow does not a summer make 
10313,West Ham,"See how gets through the Christmas period , plenty winnable games "
10314,West Ham,No where near close to an apology yet 
10315,West Ham,"I wanted him out before the international break so we had time to readjust, but if he really has been given 2 games (difficult fixtures too) to turn it around, it's hard to complain when he actually turns it around? 

It's only one game, and wasn't a faultless performance, but it's worth waiting to see if the rhythm we had was a fluke or not because maybe the team are genuinely starting to click and make sense of his tactics. 

Last night's the first time in a while I've really seen us be positively aggressive, positionally aware and the quick passing and movement we've been crying out for.

A few more games and I guess we'll know. "
10316,West Ham,"No, he's a bellend. "
10317,West Ham,"One good result out of 12? Nah fuck off. He isn't the right manager and should still go. Your memory is atrocious. Progress is progress, and there was visible progress across the board today."
10318,West Ham,"Fuck off with this shit. Lop cannot stay long, but I'll take the wins until we are safe. "
10319,West Ham,"what? fucking stop and fuck Slopetegui. we're still bottom third in goals scored and goals allowed. the team looks decent every third game and has looked helpless more than competent this year. I'll apologize if the Slop ever gets us into Euro contention, but until then he is a major wank "
10320,West Ham,"Nah. Newcastle could've put 4 past us. The weaknesses and issues are still glaring and one good half doesn't erase that.

I look at that performance and see the weaknesses and I think we could get smashed the next game. if I were a Newcastle fan I'd think that they were unlucky and wouldn't worry too much. "
10321,West Ham,"welcome to football fans on the internet, where a player / manager can go from zero to hero and back again all in the same week Same day!!! Tbf they're like that in real life too"
10322,West Ham,"have you never heard of the saying ""don't put your dick in crazy""? There's a sliding scale where a certain amount is ok."
10323,West Ham,"https://www.ismercuryinretrograde.com/ Well, this explains so much this season. Looking forward to December 15th. Well, of course that's a thing!"
10324,West Ham,"It was nice to see a game out without being completely bombarded like it was under Moyes. The crowd were doing the olés at the 89th minute as we passed it about.
Ings even got a couple of chances to make it to 3. "
10325,West Ham,"Played very good. Not prime Barca as some fans expect from this new project, but beat the Saudis away and did so with class and hard work. Great! Hopefully signs of good things to come. Won’t expect a result against arsenal but hopefully we are heading in the right direction 😁😁"
10326,West Ham,"Progress is progress, and there was visible progress across the board today. Too little too late."
10327,West Ham,Same day!!! 
10328,West Ham,Tbf they're like that in real life too 
10329,West Ham,"There's a sliding scale where a certain amount is ok. I can't argue with that, but tread carefully"
10330,West Ham,"Well, this explains so much this season. Looking forward to December 15th. "
10331,West Ham,"Well, of course that's a thing! "
10332,West Ham,Great! Hopefully signs of good things to come. Won’t expect a result against arsenal but hopefully we are heading in the right direction 😁😁 
10333,West Ham,Too little too late. Says you.
10334,West Ham,"I can't argue with that, but tread carefully "
10335,West Ham,"Says you. Yeah no shit. Hence why I said it, you dolt."
10336,West Ham,"Yeah no shit. Hence why I said it, you dolt. Just fill out the form"
10337,West Ham,Just fill out the form 
10338,West Ham,SomethINGS wrong there. 
10339,West Ham,They fixed it pretty quick. 
10340,West Ham,Im confused I thought i saw him with nottingahnm forest That was Ogbonna.
10341,West Ham,"Noticed that aswell, I honestly thought bowen was coming off for coufal at that moment "
10342,West Ham,"What you get for watching a channel called ""usa"" Beat 5£ a month and I’ll skip"
10343,West Ham,Hope he does - miss thst dude 
10344,West Ham,Wish he fucking did...absolutely stinking the place out for Forest. 
10345,West Ham,That was Ogbonna. 
10346,West Ham,Beat 5£ a month and I’ll skip Fair enough aha
10347,West Ham,Fair enough aha How’d you know it was called USA
10348,West Ham,How’d you know it was called USA Saw someone in the matchthread complaining about the same thing and have sailed the seas enough on 3pm kick offs to know it's an actual channel
10349,West Ham,"Saw someone in the matchthread complaining about the same thing and have sailed the seas enough on 3pm kick offs to know it's an actual channel Yeah im not from the us either, but it is surprisingly easy to buy the subscription in the US for pennies. What do you mean by 3 pm kick offs?"
10350,West Ham,"Yeah im not from the us either, but it is surprisingly easy to buy the subscription in the US for pennies. What do you mean by 3 pm kick offs? Kickoff was at 3pm Eastern in the US today."
10351,West Ham,Kickoff was at 3pm Eastern in the US today. 
10352,West Ham,"Today was definitely the best we've looked since City. Soler was what I expected him to be when we got him on loan and I think he's helped unlock Paqueta because they're both able to pass well and move well off the ball and none of Soucek/Guido/Alvarez have really been able to give him that when any of those two were in the midfield with him. Not a perfect performance, especially in the first half where we looked a bit suspect defensively but I think today is the first time it felt like where we're playing the way Lope wants us to. We passed well but I wish we'd be a bit more clinical with our chances "
10353,West Ham,"By God did we need that! Good win and performance, let’s hope this kick starts the beginning of a decent run. 

Saturday won’t be easy, but we’ll be up for it. COYI ⚒️ "
10354,West Ham,Can someone let JLo have a lie down now - the bloke looks like he is about to collapse. Always lovely to get one over the Geordies. Say what you want about Lopetegui but he clearly cares at least 😂
10355,West Ham,"Only 7 points of top 3 Man, I love your optimism"
10356,West Ham,"Wow. This is the first time all season I've been impressed by our performance. Until tonight all we really did was pass the ball backwards and sideways, slowly and laboriously, but this was the first time that we've moved the ball with speed, intent, and were able to really threaten the opposition with balls between the lines. 

I was really impressed by Paqueta and Soler tonight. Both of them played a simple but effective game of quick, incisive passing and movement. Soler looks a much more dynamic player than Rodriguez. Also I really liked that Paqueta seemed to keep it simple tonight. A lot less of the silly backheels, flicks or trying to win free kicks. Just quick and smart balls between the lines. He also seemed to be playing deeper - more alongside Soucek, with Soler typically the furthest forward of the three. 

Also I noticed that we were caught out with balls in behind a lot in the first ten minutes, but we seemed to drop a bit deeper after that. That resulted in us conceding a lot of crosses, and we did have to ride our luck defensively. We were fortunate to go in at half time with a clean sheet, and not to concede a pen at the 70th minute. I am still not convinced by Todibo, but hopefully we can continue to improve the defence. 

Hopefully tonight was the beginning of something and not just a false dawn. Certainly the way we passed the ball around tonight made me think, for the first time this season, that Lopetegui actually has some kind of a plan. "
10357,West Ham,"We had a functional midfield for the first time this season? Paqueta was back to Paqueta, Soler showed us why he's here, Soucek was great as usual this season. 

Huge improvement! That has to be our default midfield trio going forward, surely.
 
Soler was absolute class when he was played in the right position - this felt like his actual debut tonight, and not only that, but his pairing with Paqueta was the first time this season that Paq has looked like the player we knew - bloody hell, it was like having two new signings tonight. And Soucek is just a pure warrior in the shirt - he always gives everything, and he's proven time and time again that he's the lynchpin of the midfield - it's genuinely baffling that people spent a lot of the early season wanting him dropped - for me he's every bit as West Ham as Bowen, and should be one of the first names on the team sheet every week.
 
Fitness permitting, I just don't see a world where we go back to Guido's absolute lack of pace tearing the whole midfield open, or Alvarez's shoddy timing giving away reckless free kicks and picking up constant bans.
 
This is it, now, I think. This is our formation. This is our starting lineup. If Rodriguez, Alvarez or Mo want back in, they need to do something to earn it."
10358,West Ham,"AWB deserves a shout out too. What a bloke. He was great today, and not just the goal"
10359,West Ham,Headline: Former champions of Europe return to form in St James Park to give Oil money Club the beating it deserves. Will they manage to keep this form? Can JLo finally get some sleep? Has anybody said Europe? More to come next week when it’s time again for West Ham: get your week ruined or have fun; we flip a coin before the game to decide what‘s it gonna be! 
10360,West Ham,JLo’s “man who just had to shoot an escaped horse stuck in the central reservation of the A13” look really working for the team. Divorced Dad FC ⚒️ Tbh I look like that when having to drive in the A13 he looked like me on MOT day waiting for the phonecall from the garage. That’s a very specifically tilbury mood that
10361,West Ham,"Soler was just amazing in that he hasn't shown what he can really do until now. But what a team performance! We can pass the ball!! Fuck me dead, who are these jokers and what have they done with my team?

COYI "
10362,West Ham,"We now have 10 points in our last 6, I think it's time to back the manager. We've had a very tough run of fixtures to open the season and still play Wolves, Leicester, Southampton, Brighton and Bournemouth before we get to the halfway point in the season. Our passing and possession is light years ahead of last season and improving. Defense has been improving and I think Lopetegui has finally figured out Guido shouldn't start. And this run has been mostly without Kudus available, his return will be a major boost.

Not saying the performances are great yet but they're improving and we're starting to build chemistry and an identity.

With all that being said, I thought Newcastle were awful tonight. Exactly, I said before the season started that I thought it would take until December for the team to start together. Definitely not getting ahead of myself as it’s only one match, but the next month will be so important I'm more than willing to be proven wrong but I think this is a blip and we'll soon go back to being turgid and dire. Remain utterly unconvinced but this is a small step forward. No reason to back the worst manager in the prem, he has got to go, this win was in spite of him not because of him. You can still see none of the players respect or even want him talking to them."
10363,West Ham,"A comfortable 0-2 win away at an oil state? Have we clicked, boys? "
10364,West Ham,Can't wait for the 5 minutes of post-match analysis in between Amorim's first game in charge of Man Utd and the ongoing Salah contract talks at Liverpool. 
10365,West Ham,"I think the presence of Soler helped Paq. to have his best game in ages.  

Rather than trying to pair Paq. with Soucek, we actually had 2 proper on-the-ball midfielders in the right areas and right distance apart, rather than having a slower than slow Rodrigeuz lagging behind and Whirley Boy Soucek bombing ahead, leaving Paq. an island in the middle.

Also, we controlled the second half very well, we were especially composed in the last 7-10 mins when Newcastle were desparate, we kept stringing the passes along and took any late sting they might had. "
10366,West Ham,"Is this the first time that Calum Wilson hasn't scored against us? First Dominic Calvert-Lewin the other week, now Wilson. What on earth is going on? Breaking the cycle has to start somewhere"
10367,West Ham,"If we're going to slate him for what he does wrong we also have to praise what he does right. Loppy made the right choices tonight. As far as I am concerned the first 11 now picks itself. Much more comfortable on the ball. Frequently picking the right choices for the first time across a full 90 mins. Looked solid enough against a real pacey Newcastle tonight. The defensive line was excellent - All held together and moved back and forward as a unit. Not a single complaint from the on match performance.

A question - What do we do when Kudus comes back? It'll come around quickly. Honestly, I really don't think that Kudus just walks back into this side.
 
The line-up and formation we saw tonight has to be our go-to from now on I think, we looked like an actual cohesive unit in midfield and going forward for arguably the first time this term. Soler was immense when he was actually played in the correct position, and he actually brought out the best in Paqueta and tempered his more outlandish nonsense from earlier in the season. Those two need to play together in the middle. Soucek has better pace, better judgement and a better temperament than Alvarez, and is an absolute warrior. Bowen belongs on the wing, trying to stick him up front has never worked well. And Cree has looked so fucking tidy and is a real team player - I love seeing how well he's gelled with Emerson to make an absolute unit on that left side. If Kudus plays in the same style that he has done so far this season, I don't see how replacing any of those guys with him brings us an upgrade tbh.
 
We all loved Mo last season - rightly so - but he's been an absolute liability this season. He's become allergic to passing the ball, and has absolutely forgotten he even has teammates - his selfish play and refusal to send the ball to other players with an open chance in favour of trying to go for the trickier glory play himself has cost us more goals than he's contributed to, and his one-man game of Double Dragon against Spurs was just embarrassing.
 
He's spent this season trying to put together a highlight reel to get himself in the shop window rather than playing for the team, and all he's ended up doing is showing us that the team can do well without him. 
 
Sorry, but if he wants back on the pitch after his suspension he needs to earn it rather than just being handed it."
10368,West Ham,"I think that is the best we’ve played in 2024.  

The key was the midfield- much more mobile and tactically flexible.  

Definitely did not see that coming. "
10369,West Ham,The league table is insanely congested; we're only 4 points off 6th place 
10370,West Ham,"Andy Irving looks promising I agree. He looked very comfortable on the ball and his passes were dead on (9/9 on 12 touches). He’s 23, hardly promising. Decent squad player, nothing more."
10371,West Ham,"A very solid team performance, the like of which we expected a lot more of 12 weeks ago. 

Antonio set the pace with his hustling. Soler looked perfectly competent when actually playing a position he’s familiar with.  The defense was organized.  AWB wasn’t play insanely far forward.  

More of this please. "
10372,West Ham,"Best performance of the year from Paqueta and we looked much better. 

Not really sure where it came from, but the level as generally much higher. Perhaps a bit of seige mentality? Partly the boss under pressure and partly players being out meaning there's more pressure on those who start? Whatever it was, Jlo needs to bottle that lightning. 

Still a lot to improve on, but there was a lot of confidence from a team that have been so poor. And dare I say it, a sense of style coming through? Soler actually being played in his proper position for what feels like the first time in the shirt made him actually seem like a tidy player - I think that's the first time we've *really* seen him this term...
 
No Guido trudging around actually gave our midfield a bit of pace and urgency...
 
No Alvarez just spamming the tackle button like a ten-year-old on FIFA, and no Kudus forgetting he has teammates going for the daft glory plays...
 
...This felt like the first time this season that we actually had a legit starting XI that were all gelled and were playing for each other as a team. 
 
I still think that Ings is probably more suited to Lopball than Antonio is, but Antonio is Inevitable so I won't dwell on that 
 
We'll see what next weekend brings, but it almost feels like we're turning a corner, lads. Soler and Paqueta around Soucek were more mobile and disciplined than Alvarez and Rodriguez. I know we like the mexican and he has qualities but he wasn't missed.

Nor Kudus on the left either TBF The managers job was on the line and they played for him, that’s enough really"
10373,West Ham,A miracle Wilson didn’t score against us 
10374,West Ham,"Finally, what a relief! I really enjoyed watching the game. I believe in the guys, and we should support JLo. I think he just needs a bit more time. "
10375,West Ham,"Not sure we would let the geordies score if we played another 90. They brought on all their big guns and got nothing. Won't say we've turned the corner but we needed that tonight. Paq did less stupid shit than normal.  Soler looked decent. Great from everyone, playing as a team finally. Enjoy your return to La Liga Guido, won't miss ya. "
10376,West Ham,did Theo Walcott completely write off our chances of a win right at the end of Skys match build up? Yes and then Newcastle were losing from the 10th minute onwards lol
10377,West Ham,"Lads, are we actually good? "
10378,West Ham,Happy with the result today. Lopetegui looks like he's carrying the weight of the world with that beard. He's not allowed to shave if we play like that with the beard.
10379,West Ham,We needed that. 
10380,West Ham,"Still don’t think Lopetegui is the man to take us forward, but time will tell. To all those who think his performance so far is a vindication of Moyes, however, I ask - can you see him doing anything other than sitting on the early lead? It’s a great result and credit to J Lo but I think he needs to do it on more than one occasion. Let’s see how we look on Saturday against Arsenal."
10381,West Ham,"This was a very good performance from the team. Although the Geordies were shit.
It’s just a great feeling to see a decent account of ourselves, by far the best display this season so far! COYI
LETS DO THE GOONERS NEXT. "
10382,West Ham,"We would've absolutely sat back for that second half last season. Coming out and dominating them for the majority of the second half is absolutely huge, and something we have to build on. It's easy to acknowledge that Newcastle simply weren't very good and should've scored one or two through Isak, but I'd also argue we let a couple of equally good chances go to waste in the second half. Very happy tonight! COYI!!! "
10383,West Ham,"I do genuinely think because Bruno and Joe are playing for NEW, Paqueta plays with greater intensity against them. He was much improved today and the link ups with Soler were great. "
10384,West Ham,Pretty f...ing great if you ask me. Beating Saudi away and doing so in style is impressive. Thought every single player ran their socks off. 
10385,West Ham,I’m still trying to understand how Joelinton managed to avoid being carded… 
10386,West Ham,Never in doubt 
10387,West Ham,Well I didn't have that on my bingo card.  Hopefully this can be a turning point for us. 
10388,West Ham,what a game from the boys! 
10389,West Ham,"I'm happy to see that performance, takes away a bit of my worry regarding the dressing room.

Onwards and upwards. "
10390,West Ham,What is this feeling of actually not being depressed after we play? 
10391,West Ham,"Amazing intensity in the first half and still taking the game to them at 2-0 up too, rode our luck a bit at times but you always have to at some point. Best performance I’ve seen from us in a long time!

So happy for everyone that travelled up there too, Newcastle away on a Monday night is ridiculous so they deserved that tonight! "
10392,West Ham,"Paqueta was class. Got stuck in and seemed to have a touch in every attack.

And finally, a performance from Soler! The bloke seemed to be everywhere to receive a pass and keep things moving. "
10393,West Ham,COYI!!! 
10394,West Ham,"Where has this football been all season 😂 Some of the football was scintillating, looked better defensively too.

Soler and Paq must start together in the middle with a holder behind, controlled the game much better being able to play through the press I agree it must be Soler and Paqueta together going forward, and have either Alvarez or Soucek behind them. Night and day performance actually giving Paqueta a good passer to work off of"
10395,West Ham,"Finally Lop learned he could start a game without Guido - what a difference it makes to have a midfield that is comfortable on the ball!

I like the look of Soler and Paqueta if they can continue to build chemistry! "
10396,West Ham,"Bloody hell boys, we won a game! Guess JLo remains in position for the foreseeable. Whether that’s a good thing or not I’m not sure. "
10397,West Ham,Started slow-petegui 
10398,West Ham,"Kilman was the best player I thought. Lots of good and some very good performances, but I thought he was exceptional and even in our dreadful performances he's been decent. Really great signing and a great player. "
10399,West Ham,Amazing performance compared to the last 3 months of side and back passing tosh. Lots of players deserve credit alongside the boss. Solid display from Fabs. 
10400,West Ham,2nd half was actually fun to watch. Haven’t felt that emotion in a while. 
10401,West Ham,Some excellent saves from Fabianski today too. 
10402,West Ham,"Was a great game for us. And I think it was all down to our constant movement in the midfield. At times we passed in a triangle like Barca in the golden days, it was really impressive. Heck, when I pointed it out, even my wife, who has little to no clue about football, but still watches WHU games with me, said she could see it as well.

Although Paqueta had a good game, he still has to up his composure and not lose the ball in a foolish way. Most of their counters came from just that, Paqueta trying to be ""smart"" with heel passes etc.

We also have to give praise to Antonio, he terrorized their defense, never stopped running, was always an outlet for our midfield.

I expected us to get battered, but I am pleased that we basically dominated the game. It could have changed if VAR did the correct call and give a pen against Mavro, that was a foul. We were lucky with that, but overall we outplayed them. "
10403,West Ham,I'm so impressed with Kilman's calmess when pressed/in small spaces. 
10404,West Ham,what I learnt from the game is that I wouldn't be upset if we sold Kudus (for big money of course). He seems to unbalance the team when he plays. 
10405,West Ham,It was a fantastic and timely result. I still believe we need to figure out what's wrong with our first 10 minutes of any game though... 
10406,West Ham,"Three points is great but this is just papering over the cracks. Just like the United game, we rode our luck with two clinical finishes while conceding several key chances (and once again had a very dubious VAR call go our way)

Ill probably get downvoted but this really doesn't seem like Lopetegui has figured anything out. Another performance where we only played well for one half, another performance where we were caught out playing a high line and cut open through the middle. 

I hope I'm wrong and this is a turning point, but it's remarkable we kept a clean sheet that game based on the first half chances, the Todibo mistake and the penalty, which we'd be livid if it was the other way

Mind you, I think we looked a lot better without Rodriguez "
10407,West Ham,"I love supporting this club! Totally agree with a majority of these comments - especially Paq and Soler doing well - I don’t think any other club has such clued up, knowledgable supporters. Just wish the managers would read these threads and take sone inspiration! "
10408,West Ham,Back like need to tighten up as we could get punished by someone else better 
10409,West Ham,Say what you want about Lopetegui but he clearly cares at least 😂 
10410,West Ham,"Man, I love your optimism Makes a nice change, considering yesterday the talk was we were in a relegation scrap and could lose the next 6 matches (which includes both Leicester and Wolves)."
10411,West Ham,"That has to be our default midfield trio going forward, surely.
 
Soler was absolute class when he was played in the right position - this felt like his actual debut tonight, and not only that, but his pairing with Paqueta was the first time this season that Paq has looked like the player we knew - bloody hell, it was like having two new signings tonight. And Soucek is just a pure warrior in the shirt - he always gives everything, and he's proven time and time again that he's the lynchpin of the midfield - it's genuinely baffling that people spent a lot of the early season wanting him dropped - for me he's every bit as West Ham as Bowen, and should be one of the first names on the team sheet every week.
 
Fitness permitting, I just don't see a world where we go back to Guido's absolute lack of pace tearing the whole midfield open, or Alvarez's shoddy timing giving away reckless free kicks and picking up constant bans.
 
This is it, now, I think. This is our formation. This is our starting lineup. If Rodriguez, Alvarez or Mo want back in, they need to do something to earn it. Agreed. 

I could see them still as useful subs. Bringing them on in the second half to defend a lead, or maybe starting against City if you wanted a low block from the off (although Lopetegui doesn't seem to do those kind of radical game-to-game changes, which is fair enough). 

I'd still love Soucek as captain. But I understand the choice of Bowen and why people would want to stick with him."
10412,West Ham,"He was great today, and not just the goal "
10413,West Ham,Divorced Dad FC ⚒️ Only presidents age quicker than West Ham managers.
10414,West Ham,Tbh I look like that when having to drive in the A13 
10415,West Ham,he looked like me on MOT day waiting for the phonecall from the garage. 
10416,West Ham,That’s a very specifically tilbury mood that 
10417,West Ham,"Exactly, I said before the season started that I thought it would take until December for the team to start together. Definitely not getting ahead of myself as it’s only one match, but the next month will be so important My exact comment after we signed Todibo:

""I love the signing if it goes through, but we should still temper expectations a bit. The new signings need time to gel and it's a new system everyone is adapting to this season. Top 10 should be expected but there's still a lot of good squads competing for European places."""
10418,West Ham,I'm more than willing to be proven wrong but I think this is a blip and we'll soon go back to being turgid and dire. Remain utterly unconvinced but this is a small step forward. Woah don't get ahead of yourself Mr positive
10419,West Ham,"No reason to back the worst manager in the prem, he has got to go, this win was in spite of him not because of him. You can still see none of the players respect or even want him talking to them. Hard to respect with the grammar in that username Utter joke nonsense Ridiculous comment Lol What game were you watching?  This was the most inspired performance of the season. Ok... time to watch something else."
10420,West Ham,Breaking the cycle has to start somewhere 
10421,West Ham,"Honestly, I really don't think that Kudus just walks back into this side.
 
The line-up and formation we saw tonight has to be our go-to from now on I think, we looked like an actual cohesive unit in midfield and going forward for arguably the first time this term. Soler was immense when he was actually played in the correct position, and he actually brought out the best in Paqueta and tempered his more outlandish nonsense from earlier in the season. Those two need to play together in the middle. Soucek has better pace, better judgement and a better temperament than Alvarez, and is an absolute warrior. Bowen belongs on the wing, trying to stick him up front has never worked well. And Cree has looked so fucking tidy and is a real team player - I love seeing how well he's gelled with Emerson to make an absolute unit on that left side. If Kudus plays in the same style that he has done so far this season, I don't see how replacing any of those guys with him brings us an upgrade tbh.
 
We all loved Mo last season - rightly so - but he's been an absolute liability this season. He's become allergic to passing the ball, and has absolutely forgotten he even has teammates - his selfish play and refusal to send the ball to other players with an open chance in favour of trying to go for the trickier glory play himself has cost us more goals than he's contributed to, and his one-man game of Double Dragon against Spurs was just embarrassing.
 
He's spent this season trying to put together a highlight reel to get himself in the shop window rather than playing for the team, and all he's ended up doing is showing us that the team can do well without him. 
 
Sorry, but if he wants back on the pitch after his suspension he needs to earn it rather than just being handed it. "
10422,West Ham,I agree. He looked very comfortable on the ball and his passes were dead on (9/9 on 12 touches). 
10423,West Ham,"He’s 23, hardly promising. Decent squad player, nothing more. You fucking take that back, he’s the best player Scotland had produced since Christian Daily and if it weren’t for his distinct lack of curly hair too I’d be worried about my impending marriage because my missus would surely find a life of luxury with him significantly more appealing"
10424,West Ham,"Soler actually being played in his proper position for what feels like the first time in the shirt made him actually seem like a tidy player - I think that's the first time we've *really* seen him this term...
 
No Guido trudging around actually gave our midfield a bit of pace and urgency...
 
No Alvarez just spamming the tackle button like a ten-year-old on FIFA, and no Kudus forgetting he has teammates going for the daft glory plays...
 
...This felt like the first time this season that we actually had a legit starting XI that were all gelled and were playing for each other as a team. 
 
I still think that Ings is probably more suited to Lopball than Antonio is, but Antonio is Inevitable so I won't dwell on that 
 
We'll see what next weekend brings, but it almost feels like we're turning a corner, lads. Spot on 👍🏼"
10425,West Ham,"Soler and Paqueta around Soucek were more mobile and disciplined than Alvarez and Rodriguez. I know we like the mexican and he has qualities but he wasn't missed.

Nor Kudus on the left either TBF "
10426,West Ham,"The managers job was on the line and they played for him, that’s enough really "
10427,West Ham,Yes and then Newcastle were losing from the 10th minute onwards lol 
10428,West Ham,"He's not allowed to shave if we play like that with the beard. Next step he shaves his head.
 
Beardy baldy foreign managers are the future, lads, and if we can't hire one, then by god we can create one. I agree"
10429,West Ham,"It’s a great result and credit to J Lo but I think he needs to do it on more than one occasion. Let’s see how we look on Saturday against Arsenal. Without him….

I’ve actually got no idea who our assistant manager is. Time to find out!"
10430,West Ham,"I agree it must be Soler and Paqueta together going forward, and have either Alvarez or Soucek behind them. Night and day performance actually giving Paqueta a good passer to work off of I think Guido could also work in that system with the 2 as both Paq and Soler are workhorses, but yeah the platform it gave us was unreal. Probably only disappointment was that neither Soler or Paq grabbed a goal"
10431,West Ham,"Makes a nice change, considering yesterday the talk was we were in a relegation scrap and could lose the next 6 matches (which includes both Leicester and Wolves). "
10432,West Ham,"Agreed.

10436,West Ham,Hard to respect with the grammar in that username I think the fact that it was the most ludicrous comment I’ve seen for a while was the hardest to respect.
10437,West Ham,Utter joke nonsense 
10438,West Ham,Ridiculous comment 
10439,West Ham,Lol 
10440,West Ham,What game were you watching?  This was the most inspired performance of the season. Were you asleep for the first half? Newcastle were very wasteful. Sure the players rallied and beat an abysmal New Castle. Nothing changes from the issues we have seen all season. If we are this excited at a mediocre performance it is a sad state of affairs at West Ham.
10441,West Ham,Ok... time to watch something else.

At PL level he can only ever sit in front of the back four.   The three in midfield today can all get up and down the pitch and swap positions.   Much more effective."

10452,West Ham,He’s been excellent honestly. 
10453,West Ham,"I was so happy when we signed him, surprised we got him tbh alway seemed a bit under the radar and like he was playing well towards the end of his man utd stint "
10454,West Ham,"""I have the high ground."" "
10455,West Ham,GENERAL WAN BISSOKI 
10456,West Ham,He killed magpies 
10457,West Ham,Ol Slop's really gonna go on a run here and save his ass isnt he Let's hope so! I don't mind watching this.
10458,West Ham,From what I seen Newcastle was just as unlucky as we were lucky. I still don't rate him as a manager. Bro plays people out of position and tries Moyesball with less possession. 
10459,West Ham,"I don’t think we’ve been better, it’s more that Newcastle have been shitter. They missed some chances, but we also played well"
10460,West Ham,I wasn’t happy when Moyes was manager. Nothing had changed. Is it just the players that are too lazy and don’t want to work off the ball? I'm confused? That was one of the most interesting progressive football matches I've seen us play in years? Mate we are winning a game. Don't you realise now we were all wrong all along
10461,West Ham,No match thread is insane. https://www.reddit.com/r/Hammers/s/4toyIGmyiU I deserve mod after this level of service
10462,West Ham,Let's hope so! I don't mind watching this.

10465,West Ham,"Mate we are winning a game.

10470,West Ham,Says it's private for me lol? Am I shadowbanned or something It means that really sensitive mod has blocked you. He does that after he mouths off or makes snarky comments to people and they have a go back. He shouldn't be allowed to make match threads given how many people he blocks tbh.

10474,West Ham,"Antonio exists in a quantum superposition of being both the worst and best player on the pitch that's why I crack up every time someone says we need an ""Antonio type player""

you can't replace this guy he's a meme I've always consider him the most chaos player I've ever seen. Defenders cant possibly know what he's going to do, if he himself does not know. I vividly remember shouting ‘if he only had a brain’ at one point about five seasons ago. Failing to run the ball into the corner late against Palace will live long in the memory, as will his first ever goal for us against Southampton following a period during which he was a literal punchline (if you don’t recall the David Gold missing friend tweet, do yourself a favour and look it up) and finally got a goal by laying on the floor whilst a defender booted the ball against his head. 

That latter moment sums him up quite nicely for me, he’s someone that chaotic things just happen to - for better or worse. Liverpool fans like to joke about Nuñez being a chaos agent, but before Nuñez there was Antonio.

He’s been literally unplayable at times, and at others he’s barely looked like a professional footballer. And yet here he still is, still pulling off the odd incredible physical moment - if rarely a full game, or half, anymore - and our record Premier League goalscorer, all after starting off with a first goal that he knew nothing about. You’ve got to love him really.

My favourite moment was still probably against Macclesfield in the cup (playing left wing). Hardly a fair match up but the first time he went shoulder to shoulder with their full back and then sprinted off down the line even in the stadium you could see the full back’s full body expression of ‘what the **** is that?’. He’s his own worst enemy."
10475,West Ham,JLo looks like he hasn’t slept in a month. And he might not have. Or coming off a lost weekend. Hence the twitch
10476,West Ham,absolute menacing tactics we are seeing here. tactically swapping out Antonio’s shirt 30 minutes in to strike fear into the opponent with his sheer size and peak physique. Newcastle is shaking He's gonna start progressively rolling those shorts up higher as the second half goes on 😂
10477,West Ham,"They'll never make me hate you soucek 

(Don't go through my history) I don't understand how someone can hate that guy. He always gives 100% on the pitch."
10478,West Ham,Fucking cop that you Saudi cunts. Get in! 
10479,West Ham,Soler has had a really positive impact today. The added composure and passing ability has been very noticeable. he was good when he came on in the last match too tbf He still did like 50% of what JWP would
10480,West Ham,"bro theyve been molesting Antonio all game, wtf are the refs doing ? The most molested man in the PL He just flops to make it look like a foul, the refs have known about his games for ages."
10481,West Ham,Exactly how I predicated it. 2-0 with us doing olés in the 87th minute. Cash out now if you can.
10482,West Ham,I still can't believe Andy Irving is a perfectly reliable premier league player. This has been such a weird season. We’ve pulled him from the dark corners of Austria. The whole transfer has blown my mind He seems very comfortable out there
10483,West Ham,"Death, taxes and Paqueta giving the ball away in his own half with some BS flick "
10484,West Ham,Fabianski has been brilliant today. Rolling it back big time 
10485,West Ham,Antonio just discovered he had 5 Star skill moves the whole time hahaha I expect some good predictions from the future
10486,West Ham,"To a man, West Ham have been absolutely amazing.

Just stringing passes together and actually dictating the pace of the game is really good to see.

Let's hope this is the turning point for us!

COME ON YOU IRONS!! "
10487,West Ham,Soler is so handsome our best lookin player since dawson Extremely jealous of that hair Magnificent Barnet Christian Dailly was better!
10488,West Ham,Showing Callum Wilson on the bench has killed my mood lmao It's inevitable isn't it Why are they all dressed in our colours?
10489,West Ham,"Bowen almost with a screamer, would love to see it "
10490,West Ham,Wan-Bisakka man of the match for me. He’s been everywhere. As always
10491,West Ham,"Irving didn't put a foot wrong today. Contender for Balon D'Awson 🎵He wears the 39, and no-one knew he signed. We've got Super Andy Irving 🎵"
10492,West Ham,"I’m ready to be let down

Glad this jinx worked 😂 Right there with you brother"
10493,West Ham,"Lope looks like shit today, lack of sleep maybe he's rockin the divorced dad look"
10494,West Ham,"Also Soler has been very good today, something to build on hopefully  It’s mental what happens when you play a new player in their known best position"
10495,West Ham,"Bowen's been fucking immense today, back to his best self. Carrying the ball and leading attacks 100%"
10496,West Ham,Soucek with a cheeky crossed irons and a wink to camera. You love to see it You love to see it! Irons ⚒️
10497,West Ham,What a move keep it up boys 
10498,West Ham,He’s a gorgeous man isn’t he 
10499,West Ham,😂😂😂 I'm going to miss Antonio when his time is up despite everything. 
10500,West Ham,"Keep talking shit on Paqueta. Man started that beauty. He's played well tonight, I think this midfield trio suits him"
10501,West Ham,"Seemingly every goal this season comes from Bowen in some way, absolutely love that man We're lucky to have him"
10502,West Ham,"Such an interesting sport. The game is dominated by Newcastle and we finish our one chance and all of a sudden we start dominating the game. 90% of the game is confidence I swear >90% of the game is confidence I swear

100%"
10503,West Ham,6 minutes what fucking for? How else are Newcastle meant to have a chance to win? Saudi daddy's called in for it
10504,West Ham,My heart is full of pretty bubbles today 
10505,West Ham,That has been one of the best performances I have seen by us in the league this year. 
10506,West Ham,"Looks like potato salad is back on the menu, boys. "
10507,West Ham,"2 nil up and still pushing forward in the 80th minute. If it were Moyes we’d be forming a human pyramid on the goal line at this point. weve looked so much better since scoring the 2nd.

we were struggling for the ball before that - now seems to be actually part of the game."
10508,West Ham,About 4 Newcastle players should have yellows rn and none of them have one 
10509,West Ham,JLo looks like he might collapse at any given moment. 
10510,West Ham,"Joelington just knows he wont get a card. dont blame him, I would want to be in Souceks arms too"
10511,West Ham,First time I’ve ever seen AWB smile 
10512,West Ham,"Carlton and Marlon in the away end, brilliant "
10513,West Ham,"Incredible how Fabianski has been so good for us since he came, and still now Been my favourite keeper since I've started watching, over Ludo and Rob Green"
10514,West Ham,Anyone remembers Gordon penalty of last season?  This is payback 😁 Wasn’t there 2 of them in one match? So good seeing him do fck all tonight 
10515,West Ham,Superb Irons. Jlop and team earned their pennies over the break. Chin aligned up for the season 
10516,West Ham,"Can’t say players aren’t playing for the manager, everyone putting in a ln absolute shift No doubt"
10517,West Ham,"Think I may have just seen an emotion on Soucek's face that resembled anger for the first time ever Yeah, it annoyed me to see him like that"
10518,West Ham,"Ah God here he comes, Wilson… Ghost of Christmas past"
10519,West Ham,This is the time where i think ings has got to come on 
10520,West Ham,did he just say Michelle Antonio 
10521,West Ham,Oh shit is that Irving the GOAT ? Absolutely screamer incoming
10522,West Ham,Swerving Irving coming on. Come on lad 
10523,West Ham,"CORNERS ARE PENS god it feels good to say this again, feels like we haven‘t scored from one in ages"
10524,West Ham,"Sweet Jesus, an away goal. And a first half goal too"
10525,West Ham,"First 10 mins, we look like how we did under Moyes. Defending deep, waiting for the counter and a set piece goal. J Lo has gone back to basics and it's working so far... man has now Moyes secretly on the line giving him instructions"
10526,West Ham,"Antonio on a mad one today But at the same time he's also been absolutely dreadful 

Schrodingers Antonio"
10527,West Ham,Holy shit Mich what a tackle 
10528,West Ham,I think Antonio's shirt is ripped guys I think Antonio is ripped guys 
10529,West Ham,and theyre gonna boo soucek for getting fucking elbowed to the chest ? 
10530,West Ham,well worked goal that. bissaka does well. paqueta did well to win the ball too Great job from all of them involved
10531,West Ham,Lop has had zero sleep the last 2 weeks studying every Newcastle game in the last 3 years. Come on you Irons ⚒️ 
10532,West Ham,Soler has already scored as many goals from direct free kicks as Ward Prowse did. (None!) AWB has scored more goals that Coufal!
10533,West Ham,Carlton in the away end. Lad Just seen him haha proper
10534,West Ham,AWB is everywhere in this second half He’s been an absolute beast
10535,West Ham,"Killman has been absolute class He's been good this season tbh, class on the ball while being confident and solid defensively"
10536,West Ham,Soler is actually doing a good job when dropping in between the center backs Classic number 4 Who'd have thought a base requirement for playing DM is not being slower than my nan
10537,West Ham,Did USA just display it as ward prowse coming on lmao Says a lot about USA broadcasts.
10538,West Ham,"Fair play to Antonio, he is frustrating as fuck but he put a shift in today  "
10539,West Ham,"I swear Ings is always at the end of a cross or pass, shows the mind of a clinical striker He's unironically a near perfect fit for JLo's system of ball to feet possession play"
10540,West Ham,Need a third 
10541,West Ham,ANDYYYYY YES 
10542,West Ham,Almiron looks like the creepy lovechild of Foden and Mr Bean 
10543,West Ham,Soler over Guido. Always. Just keep Soler on his position. 
10544,West Ham,Well played West Ham and well done Lopetegui. Got it spot on! Hallelujah! 
10545,West Ham,away support giving it large portions tonight! 
10546,West Ham,Passion from Paq 🤩 
10547,West Ham,Irving has also looked fairly solid  
10548,West Ham,Weird to watch us playing relatively good. Relatively? Best game this season
10549,West Ham,Bowen is 🔥 
10550,West Ham,"4-1 incoming!!! 

No sorry, 1-4 obviously… "
10551,West Ham,Lovely move that 
10552,West Ham,"Soler actually playing in his natural position is decent, who could have guessed "
10553,West Ham,FUCKING STOP IT FABIANSKI 
10554,West Ham,I‘m scared we‘re using up all of our luck for this season rn 
10555,West Ham,Ref is blind 
10556,West Ham,"Antonio can take a punch to the face, no foul "
10557,West Ham,Ref's bent 
10558,West Ham,"I'm so nervous, but I would call this first half Progress It's hard to be worse than the dross we've been playing, but I'd say there is at least a bit more purpose even if the execution isn't quite there yet."
10559,West Ham,Soucek gets undercut while in the air and an elbow in the ribs and they get a throw in. Great stuff. 
10560,West Ham,"Score from a corner

Proceed to take the next one short "
10561,West Ham,Cunt Joelinton 
10562,West Ham,WAN BISSAKAAAAA 
10563,West Ham,4-3 is too fresh in my mind I was just saying that to my brother 😂
10564,West Ham,All I can think about is how we were 3-1 up at St James last season 
10565,West Ham,What is this lovely football we are playing??? 
10566,West Ham,Bowen is our next Mr. West Ham 
10567,West Ham,Bout time they get bookings 
10568,West Ham,"3,200 away fans at the other end of the country on a Monday night. Quality support "
10569,West Ham,This is actually quite good. Soler is playing well 
10570,West Ham,"Guido starts 11 games : we are shit 

He doesn't start today: we are fine 

Coincidence? I think not Jokes aside, absolutely not. We have been so slow in transition largely because of him and he gives the ball away so much in dangerous areas. Hopefully the last we've seen of him."
10571,West Ham,Summerville is so good! 
10572,West Ham,Ah fuck it's Callum Wilson The prick
10573,West Ham,Bowen and Wan Bisakka are playing so well together. 
10574,West Ham,"I'm curious of a double pivot Soucek Soler tbh Good news is that this makes a lot of sense on paper. Bad news is that if this doesn't work, I think that's our last possible midfield combination we haven't tried. Soler must perform tonight though or bringing him in was completely pointless. Wouldn't be surprised to see Rodriguez on at half time. Bbc has it as 4141 with Soucek covering alone. Iove the guy, and you know he'd properly put a shift in, but it would not be pretty. 

Double pivot is at least slightly more cover. From what I've seen of Soler so far, I think I'd rather Paq drop back and be in the pivot. Think he does a solid job further back like he does for the Brazilian NT Is this not a potential 442 tonight? Ended up being a revolving 3 in midfield, with Paqueta as the outlet pass.

It worked wonderfully well and Newcastle honestly had no answer."
10575,West Ham,"Thank fuck he's played Soler, I was dreading a Soucek Guido pivot. It would literally be walking football When Soler playing is better than the alternative, you know you're fucked."
10576,West Ham,Hopeful this is the one where Soler shows his potential 😬
10577,West Ham,Is Fulkrug even alive still Do you not know that we buy strikers that are old to play them for 1-2 months and then let Antonio play the rest of the season? Get to know bud
10578,West Ham,If this was FM Areola would be kicking off about a transfer about this point. He should request a move being benched for fabianski is disrespectful. Areola is having a hard time because the entire defense is so shit and they are finally starting to figure it out. Hopefully he starts again after Newcastle tear us a new asshole
10579,West Ham,"Seeing this line up, I actually have a bit of hope and I bet on us "
10580,West Ham,"No Rodriguez at least Unironically, that was my ""Jlo-out"" line in the sand. Starting Guido at the base of midfield is the thing most proven to not work."
10581,West Ham,Massive game for Soler 
10582,West Ham,Just don’t be shit cunts for one night please West Ham 
10583,West Ham,"I really wanted to see ings start, but other than that, its okay Ings suits the way we attack so much better than Antonio, whether you like the way we attack or not the way we do it Ings fits so much better. He can make a 5ft pass to a teammate he can hit the target without having touched the ball for a long while. Antonio is more likely to have the ball ballon off him and create an opposition counter attack or put it in row z."
10584,West Ham,"Interesting midfield three, especially with the Rodriguez rumour mill in full swing. What's being said?"
10585,West Ham,At least not a back 3 
10586,West Ham,"Glad Rodriguez is finally gone but hard to make a case for Soler, Antonio or Paquetá. I'd like to see Orford on the bench at least too.

Instinct says we get dicked. "
10587,West Ham,Todibo doesn't look convinced 
10588,West Ham,When is kudus back 
10589,West Ham,COYI 
10590,West Ham,Lopotegui looking about 80 years old in the pre-match interview. 
10591,West Ham,"I can’t see us getting anything.

Happy to be proven wrong though. "
10592,West Ham,Fantastic football 
10593,West Ham,"I don’t understand how players are lining up. The back 4 seems simple but it almost looks like a 4-1-2-3 but Bowen and Summerville are on the wrong sides. The only way Summerville looks to be on the left is if this is a 4-4-2 in the order listed but that also makes even less sense. 

Also Ings should be starting over Antonio. Likely Paquetá as a 10 with Summerville left and Bowen right, no? Leeds fan here. Summerville is best on the left. His signature move is to cut in on his right foot and curl  a low shot into the far corner. He's not the sort of winger who beats a man and curls a cross in. Frankly he'd be wasted on the right."
10594,West Ham,"I can't recall, is Mo injured? Two games left of his suspension (including this). Suspended (4 out of) 5 game ban"
10595,West Ham,"Alvarez just not selected, because he's a massive div? Suspended for a second game because he's a massive div, actually"
10596,West Ham,Free Fulkrug Still injured mate... our striker curse will never end. Free Ings!
10597,West Ham,[deleted] Still suspended since it's his second red of the season Suspended Alvarez paqueta kudus the list of those who owe us a decent game or two is growing
10598,West Ham,"Good news is that this makes a lot of sense on paper. Bad news is that if this doesn't work, I think that's our last possible midfield combination we haven't tried. Soler must perform tonight though or bringing him in was completely pointless. Wouldn't be surprised to see Rodriguez on at half time. Irving at this point"
10599,West Ham,"Bbc has it as 4141 with Soucek covering alone. Iove the guy, and you know he'd properly put a shift in, but it would not be pretty. 

Double pivot is at least slightly more cover. Honest question, don't see any provocation but how would BBC know?"
10600,West Ham,"From what I've seen of Soler so far, I think I'd rather Paq drop back and be in the pivot. Think he does a solid job further back like he does for the Brazilian NT I find him too casual with the ball to play DM. I'd prefer him more as a 8"
10601,West Ham,"Is this not a potential 442 tonight? I see it as a 4-2-3-1 but hey, we will know soon"
10602,West Ham,"Ended up being a revolving 3 in midfield, with Paqueta as the outlet pass.

It worked wonderfully well and Newcastle honestly had no answer. "
10603,West Ham,"When Soler playing is better than the alternative, you know you're fucked. "
10604,West Ham,😬

10609,West Ham,What's being said? He wants to go back to La Liga in January That he regrets coming and wants to leave in Jan
10610,West Ham,"Likely Paquetá as a 10 with Summerville left and Bowen right, no? Yeah I think so, I don't see how anyone sees it any other way than that"
10611,West Ham,Leeds fan here. Summerville is best on the left. His signature move is to cut in on his right foot and curl  a low shot into the far corner. He's not the sort of winger who beats a man and curls a cross in. Frankly he'd be wasted on the right.

10613,West Ham,Suspended 
10614,West Ham,"(4 out of) 5 game ban ah that's right, thanks lads. Whoever downvoted me go cunt yourself you absolute plonker"
10615,West Ham,"Suspended for a second game because he's a massive div, actually Oh I thought he was due back tonight"
10616,West Ham,"Still injured mate... our striker curse will never end. Have we ever tried doing the reverse?

Buy an injured striker who gets healed and then actually works?"
10617,West Ham,Free Ings! 
10618,West Ham,Still suspended since it's his second red of the season 
10619,West Ham,Suspended 
10620,West Ham,Alvarez paqueta kudus the list of those who owe us a decent game or two is growing 
10621,West Ham,Irving at this point Irving on in the second half to smack an absolute screamer top bins.
10622,West Ham,"Honest question, don't see any provocation but how would BBC know? Oh certainly it's usually guess work based on what we have played most of the year."
10623,West Ham,I find him too casual with the ball to play DM. I'd prefer him more as a 8 
10624,West Ham,"I see it as a 4-2-3-1 but hey, we will know soon I was hoping he'd change it up. I fear you are correct though 😞"
10625,West Ham,He wants to go back to La Liga in January Thank fuck for that Betis can have him in exchange for Pablo
10626,West Ham,That he regrets coming and wants to leave in Jan 
10627,West Ham,"Yeah I think so, I don't see how anyone sees it any other way than that I think they meant the way it's been laid out on the image makes it look like Bowen as a striker.

Which tbf isn't impossible. Antonio did say this week his preferred position is on the wing, and he's been dogshit up front so far."
10628,West Ham,"ah that's right, thanks lads. Whoever downvoted me go cunt yourself you absolute plonker 'Go cunt yourself' love it 😂 homie it's just reddit"
10629,West Ham,"Oh I thought he was due back tonight Even the Prem thought so as they seemed to be indicating he's back, but apparently not"
10630,West Ham,"Have we ever tried doing the reverse?

10631,West Ham,Irving on in the second half to smack an absolute screamer top bins. 
10632,West Ham,Oh certainly it's usually guess work based on what we have played most of the year. 
10633,West Ham,I was hoping he'd change it up. I fear you are correct though 😞 That'll be a 7-2-1 😂
10634,West Ham,Thank fuck for that

Almost every lineup sheet is in the order right to left how the lineup from goal unless it’s by number order. I don’t know who puts the order in these images out but this isn’t the first time the order is bizarre and often it matches how everyone actually does lineup. 

Today, it clearly been essentially a 4-2-3-1 with Soler behind Antonio in the middle then Summerville and Bowen on their best sides."
10637,West Ham,'Go cunt yourself' love it 😂 I will be using that tomorrow at work.
10638,West Ham,homie it's just reddit IT'S MORE THAN THAT
10639,West Ham,"Even the Prem thought so as they seemed to be indicating he's back, but apparently not I guess if you're not sure it's best to just leave him at home. High chance he's suspended for any given game."
10640,West Ham,That'll be a 7-2-1 😂 😂

10644,West Ham,"I guess if you're not sure it's best to just leave him at home. High chance he's suspended for any given game. If it's not this one, then it's definitely the next one"
10645,West Ham,😂 
10646,West Ham,Okay Dr. Clark 
10647,West Ham,"If it's not this one, then it's definitely the next one "
10648,West Ham,"Calgarian here, hopped on the massive club bandwagon just a few years ago. "
10649,West Ham,"You need to go to The Ship on 17 Ave on match days. There's always a few knocking around. 

⚒️⚒️⚒️ "
10650,West Ham,"2 seasons ago, there was around 50 of us in the Barley Mow, but it probably wasn't the 'main' pub. We didn't bother looking elsewhere and just went to the ground early. Plenty of us in there ⚒️ Perfect ta mate!"
10651,West Ham,"We've always gone to the counting house near the cinema. It is a mix of home and away fans though. Actually thinking about it now there was a bit of trouble last time after the game so not sure if they'll be allowing away fans in this year. That’s annoying, as that was going to be where we went. I might still try my luck to be fair"
10652,West Ham,Counting House I think  
10653,West Ham,"Give me love to Moyes.

If he’s appointed, guaranteed battering "
10654,West Ham,how much for the spare mate? 
10655,West Ham,Perfect ta mate! 
10656,West Ham,"That’s annoying, as that was going to be where we went. I might still try my luck to be fair The 4/5 I've been it's been mainly West Ham in there and never seen any trouble. I'd probably still try my luck, decent pub always plenty of staff so you're not waiting ages for a beer."
10657,West Ham,"The 4/5 I've been it's been mainly West Ham in there and never seen any trouble. I'd probably still try my luck, decent pub always plenty of staff so you're not waiting ages for a beer. "
10658,West Ham,Ipswich aren’t going to let Delap go in January are they? 
10659,West Ham,"It’s not football manager. Doesn’t work like that. Delap certainly isn’t going anywhere

That said, whichever goal scoring genius we sign will inevitably end up suffering Beni Maccarthy syndrome. "
10660,West Ham,"This is WH, signing obvious strikers isn't what we do. "
10661,West Ham,i think theyd be too expensive 
10662,West Ham,"Maybe we could get Delap in the summer if Ipswich go down, but January is never going to happen. We will not be the only one in for him, and will likely to have to pay a lot more than they did.

It's a disaster that he was available for \~£20m, but ""Super Tim"" instead decided that our team wasn't old, slow or injury prone enough and went for Fullkrug instead. Isn't the whole point of this guy that he will turn us into a modern football club, making smart long-term signings like that? "
10663,West Ham,Leave it mate we have no chance with either. City need the depth they ain't gonna let McAtee go and there is zero chance Ipswich let Delap leave in January. Besides If we wanted Delap we should have got him in the summer when he was available but then imagine the outrage in the fanbase if our marquee striker signing was Delap from the Championship instead of Fullkrug. 
10664,West Ham,Last summer was our chance to get Delap. There will be better teams than us looking to sign him for the foreseeable future. 
10665,West Ham,There’s no way either will be sold 
10666,West Ham,Delap looks great but don’t see it happening 
10667,West Ham,Victoria comet I’m told 
10668,West Ham,We're shit but we're not yet at the point of competing with Leicester for managers. 
10669,West Ham,"I doubt there’ll be too much urgency from this piece of news. I’m not even convinced J Lo will go if he loses the next two games if I’m honest. Don’t disagree. Squeaky bum time if we drop into the bottom 3 though? Yeah. He ain’t going anywhere. I'm hoping the decision to sack J Lo has already been made and they're making a deal with someone behind the scenes before they sack him publicly. Agreed, I don't see us dropping into bottom 3, comfortably 5 teams worse than us. Just means football is going to be painful to watch all season. The only way I see him being ousted is if the players revolt! Already seen some strange discipline issues (Kudus and Alvarez) and the players are not playing for him. But thats not enough for our board to take a L. Man said J Lo! Im dying fam!!"
10670,West Ham,Moyes will go to Leicester. That was my first thought - they must have sounded him out before sacking Cooper. I honestly doubt it I think he’s to old and tired to go to a relegation battle
10671,West Ham,"Off topic... went on coopers wiki, says he played for ""total network solutions fc"" went there found out its the most succesful club in the welsh premier, their wiki is wild lol. It's the club in a top flight european league with most consecutive wins, beating ajax in 2016 Also playing in Conference League this season under their new name"
10672,West Ham,I’m praying they get Moyes so I can stop hearing everybody say West Han should get him for a third time. You'll love it when he gets Leicester into Europe 😂
10673,West Ham,Lop will get sacked after the next two losses. Then we'll give the new manager a decent start of games. 
10674,West Ham,I hear ten hag is available! 
10675,West Ham,"> Lots of pundits saying we won’t go down no matter what

I mean, anyone who has watched the premier league this year and has **any** understanding of football knows we are not getting relegated. It isn't remotely a possibility. Said everyone in 2003. If you’ve watched us this season there’s no guarantee there are 3 worse teams atm. Very very lucky against Manure, awful against Everton and the way moral is going Wolves now worry me. I’m mean the whole point of my post is that Leicester are only 2 points behind us, a much worse team player for player and they’ve binned Cooper (we’re not privy to what’s going on behind the scenes to be fair). It wouldn’t be that crazy to say we could lose our next 6 games which then will takes us to Southampton away on Boxing Day, are we likely to beat them if they turn up against us like they did against the scousers today? Personally, worrying times ahead."
10676,West Ham,"Sullivan will pick an out of work manager. If Leicester are smart, they won't do the same. edin terzic Is out of work and someone id be very interested in"
10677,West Ham,David Moyes has a chance to do the funniest thing (gettem relegated again) 
10678,West Ham,"The only way Lop is gone tomorrow is if we get massively turned over (5+ goals). A tight defeat and he stays and he won’t get the chop after Arsenal.

His true fate will be determined in the Leicester/Wolves/Bournemouth games. I still think he’ll probably be gone before Christmas. "
10679,West Ham,"I don’t understand why clubs fire managers of teams full of below average players.   They’re just hoping for a miracle? You fire managers of teams with good players that are losing.  

As for us - I’d be Surprised if Potter would be open to come here after Sullivan openly shat on him. "
10680,West Ham,Nah mate. We will wait until at least March. 
10681,West Ham,Said at the start of the season that Moyes will be Leicester manager by Christmas. 
10682,West Ham,"Don’t disagree. Squeaky bum time if we drop into the bottom 3 though? It’s almost impossible to be in bottom 3 even if we lose both games

One of the 2 games lop has is Newcastle which is part of these fixtures this weekend. Palace can’t overtake us they are 4 points back and Ipswich would need to beat Forrest by 5 goals currently, possible but unlikely

Assuming we get no points from Newcastle and Leicester

That’s without factoring in wolves, lecister and Everton would all need results too"
10683,West Ham,Yeah. He ain’t going anywhere. 
10684,West Ham,I'm hoping the decision to sack J Lo has already been made and they're making a deal with someone behind the scenes before they sack him publicly.

10687,West Ham,That was my first thought - they must have sounded him out before sacking Cooper. Why are people so sure he’s wanted by anyone?

Same story when curbishley left.

A lot of people thinking he's be in demand after pulling off the great escape and keeping Charlton in the league so long but he never got another managers job ever again."
10695,West Ham,"Lmao. Good satire, you had me going for the first half. Sir. I doff my cap and apologise for not having your faith ⚒🙇‍♂️"
10696,West Ham,"How do we know Moyes was even looking for a new job at that point? For all we know he was approached but turned them down. Be a very strange career move to not work for a year at his age and still being able to point to cup win as being recent. If he was offered a premier league or any top 5 league job he’d have taken it. 

What has changed between the summer and now to make him say now’s the time to start working again?"
10697,West Ham,"Same story when curbishley left.

A lot of people thinking he's be in demand after pulling off the great escape and keeping Charlton in the league so long but he never got another managers job ever again.

Rumour has it Curbs payout was in excess of three million so he hardly needed to work again. partially, yes, but he was also a marked man in the game.

hed kept charlton in the premiership for ages, but i think they were also a bit sick of him and parted ways when his last contract was up. the problem was that they had set the club up top-to-bottom around him and his shit style, so when he went they were fucked.

he wasnt much better for us - took him forever to work out rob green was better than carroll and to get a tune out of tevez and mascherano. we probably pulled that escape of more despite him than because of him. the only thing he did better than pardew was to not fuck carl fletchers mrs.

the next season was hardly good football so it was better to get him gone than to make the mistake charlton did.

So who would want him? a promoted team, who he felt he was better than, or a premier league team that wanted to play shit football while achieving nothing in the game and leaving their club fucked at every level when he finally fucked off.

He was basically the moyes prototype.

even did the ""being a shit pundit"" thing for a bit after leaving, boring the socks off millions at a time with his boring voice and shit opinions."

10704,West Ham,I’ve been giving people tickets in my name printed out and it’s never been a problem 
10705,West Ham,You can both attend with same name. Done it many times when I’ve taken friends and family to matches and bought both tickets in my own name - and no one pays any attention 
10706,West Ham,The Ronnie Boyce goal is great.  
10707,West Ham,Where the fuck is this cross posted from lmao 
10708,West Ham,If you pause at around the 1:28 mark you can actually see some grass. That Boyce goal is almost as filthy as the pitch. 
10709,West Ham,"Ah yes, known among us City fans as the infamous ""Massacre on Mud"". A pitch invasion occurred at full-time as well. A strange game for us that season - we won the Cup Winners Cup and League Cup, had beaten West Ham 4-0 at Upton Park just a few weeks earlier, and finished much higher in the table. Just a bizarre day all round. "
10710,West Ham,That first goal was just great football 
10711,West Ham,lmao volley from almost halfway. 1:54 top left in the video almost looks like Mark Noble.
10712,West Ham,1:54 top left in the video almost looks like Mark Noble. 
10713,West Ham,"I'm glad we're playing on Monday night, it means they can't ruin the weekend for me. I can also watch MOTD, which I just can't when we lose. "
10714,West Ham,"While lopetgui has been shit. Under Moyes we didn’t want the ball and hoped for a counter to score now we want to hold the ball and keep position but when you can’t buy 11 players that suite that complete change you have to use the old ones. 

Antonio has the first touch of a brick wall so often it ricochets 10m away and we lose the control of the ball we had, from all reports fulkrug is fantastic at this aspect and can make a 10ft pass and hit a teammate. 

soucek another one love him one of my favourite hammers but doesn’t suit a possession based team. 

Both goalkeepers are fantastic shot stoppers but ball players they aren’t anywhere close to good enough to be involved in the play. 

Even Bowen isn’t exactly perfect for possession based play, although is still capable and still good. 


We could get jurgpep klopiola and we’d be in a similar position to what we are now. Obviously lopetgui isn’t showing enough adjustments and improvements so it isn’t good enough but we’d be 9-14th whoever we got as manager after Moyes unless we hired a manager similar to Moyes "
10715,West Ham,i agree so sad to watch good players play so shit 
10716,West Ham,I suggest starting to drink now. 
10717,West Ham,I need to have a drink before every West Ham match at the moment just to dull the pain 
10718,West Ham,Victoria comet opposite central station

I get that hunting is much needed for population control like for deer's etc. and then for people that actually do eat the meat etc. And, I myself could not be a vegetarian. But there's also no way I could hunt. It would make me sick to hurt and kill and innocent animal. I don't have anything against people that do hunt, especially if they do use all the meat etc. Just talking about myself. But damn, ateast use a gun and make it quick. Bow hunting on the other hand seems fucked up to me though. I'm sure much more often that's a slow and painful death."

It's the only road that you or guides can drive in the winter. If you have a vehicle that can decently handle snow, just get up right before dawn and drive that road. You won't be the first person to spot the wolves. Instead, look for a group of vehicles and see what they found. Seems easy enough.  Thx"

Excuse me, the stereotyping is that just when I remember how a woman mixed up a husky with a wolf 2 years ago, I'm willing to believe that someone could have missed it. May it be on stupidity or on purpose. I remember that story. She didn't even have the slim benefit of the doubt of it being far away because she didn't realize it was a husky until she skinned it, posed with it, then posted the photo on Facebook and the internet chewed her up for it."

10834,Wolves,"I honesty believe the reports of the 80-90kg wolves from Russia. I think wolves used to generally be larger in many places but human hunting and expansion of agricultural lands into wolf habitats have put so much pressure on them that only smaller ones survived from the \~1400-1600s onwards in most of Europe, and hence the overall 'average' size of wolves has slowly decreased with time. this is just my theorising though, so take it with a grain of salt, but I do believe the stories of massive wolves in Russia's taiga region, it would  line up with the fact that wolves in similar habitats in Alaska and parts of Canada are also noted for being able to grow to tremendous sizes when there is sufficient prey and limited pressure  on their populations by humans. This happened to Bluefin Tuna now it’s very rare to see 1000lb Bluefin Tuna"

10851,Wolves,"All three of those photos are wolves in their summer coat, when they look lanky and slim. All wolves look like that in the summer, btw, even Yellowstone wolves. You're probably seeing photos of Yellowstone wolves in their winter coats, which makes them look much larger than they are. Again, this is true for all wolves. The main reason you don't see a lot of Denali wolves in their winter coat has to do with the tourist season. Summer is the Denali tourist season, when people encounter wolves there, while Yellowstone has all-season tourism. I thought lanky wolves were associated more with temperate and warmer climates and boreal wolves were big even in summer coats. For example here in Türkiye, wolves look like [this](https://www.tramem.org/memeliler/?fsx=2fsdl15@d&idx=8273) in summer, and most large ungulates are extirpated from the wild here so they mostly subsist on rodents, hogs, feral dogs, pet dogs and livestock. I thought a wolf whose main diet was moose and caribou would be much bigger than this "
10852,Wolves,"Yellowstone is warmer than Denali, and things tend to expand with heat, so there ya go Actually, according to the Bergmann's rule, populations and species of larger size are found in colder environments, while populations and species of smaller size are found in warmer regions.

I thought a wolf whose main diet was moose and caribou would be much bigger than this  Wolves Yellowstone and Denali are the same species, gray wolves. 
And yes Gray wolves are the largest species of wolf, but they, just like every other living thing on the planet, can vary is size and weight,  adult males can weight between around 50-140lbs, the average is around 70lbs, height is between 26-32 inches and 5-6.5 feet long. Adult females range 40-80lbs, 24-28 inches tall and 4.5-6 feet long. 
Pray and habitat can play a small role in size, but it really just comes down to their genetics, and their Color variations just comes down to the ancestral dog admixture that found its way into their genetics 10,000ish  years ago.  

You also have to wonder if the wolves in the photo juveniles or adults? Are they male or female?"

Waikipedia is the only source I’ve found that says they are C.L pambasilus. If you Google Canis lupus pambasilus there are more sources about it. It's possible that Yellowstone wolves grow larger because they have more and easier prey(mule deer and elk) meanwhile Denali wolves have to rely on prey that's more sporadically found and way harder to take down(moose and caribou), so they burn more calories when searching for prey and attacking them. Just my two cents though

10869,Leicester City,"It’s not going to be any better than what Cooper was doing. My guess is we are going from potentially staying above relegation to diving head first into the pool. Front office obviously had no concrete plan moving forward.  Sacking a manager 3 months in for giving you exactly the amount of points you would be expecting is absurd.  Sad to say but the club deserves everything that happens the rest of this year all due to the board. What player would even possibly want to come play for us ?  

I’m most pissed that I’m gonna have to shell out another 180 quid next year to watch us on Foxes Hub rather than my $20 annual subscription to Peacock with almost every match and quality streaming. Don't kill me, but watching Cooper ball was hurting my soul.

I get that we're in a tough position and it's very important to be pragmatic. But I couldn't take another few weeks of his tactics, they were genuinely horrible to watch in my opinion.

I think we are in a better position with a manager who can instill that never quit mentality, with a belief that we can take the game to teams. That we become proactive and not reactive like in so many games.

Fans were complaining every week last year with Enzo ball and how boring it was to watch.  Have you seen our defense?  We don’t have the squad to push the attack against prem league teams and quite frankly even if we did, who is gonna score?  We have zero striker options.  The problem is with the front office not Steve Cooper. Changing managers here and changing everything up mid season I think will have an overall negative affect especially considering we don’t even have a manager decided on before firing Cooper.   Just another blunder by the top (and Top)."

The problem is with the front office not Steve Cooper. Changing managers here and changing everything up mid season I think will have an overall negative affect especially considering we don’t even have a manager decided on before firing Cooper.   Just another blunder by the top (and Top). "
10874,Leicester City,"I think that’s an absolutely moronic take. If you’re in charge of something and you feel a certain way you get additional data before making a decision. If he wanted to fire Cooper and the players were like “this guy is great we are about to turn the corner” then he probably doesn’t do it. The players validating his opinions and the fans opinions should be clear enough that action was needed Yep. Not impressed with Jordan’s comments these days. Totally agree. Why would you not want to get the viewpoint of the team before making such a big decision. If the players had equally turned round and said they really believed in him, it could have been the action that saved Cooper his job. The fact they didn’t say that is enough to sack him. Because it’s basically unsalvageable at that point, which is Cooper’s fault anyway. Absolutely idiotic take."
10875,Leicester City,Taking an active interest in your business= bad 
10876,Leicester City,"“Owner of a business should not speak to employees as it undermines the managers”

Any industry outside of football, you’d be laughed at for that take. Especially considering the players have been there was longer. Like if I hire a new manager on a team and they're underperforming why the hell would I not talk to the guy underneath him who's been here a fucking decade???"
10877,Leicester City,Idiot 
10878,Leicester City,"Simon Jordan is an absolute clown who puts out the most idiotic takes and controversial opinions to generate a couple clicks.

Truly don’t think I’ve ever seen a good opinion from him.

He took palace into administration at that. Don’t think he’s qualified to talk about owners… "
10879,Leicester City,"If that's the case then why would any manager get sacked, ever? "
10880,Leicester City,it's worth noting Jordan bought Crystal Palace in 2000 and served as chairman until the club went into administration in early 2010 
10881,Leicester City,Didn’t Simon Jordan nearly kill Palace? 
10882,Leicester City,Simon Jordan: reminding football fans everywhere that there could be an even bigger helmet in charge of their club. 
10883,Leicester City,"Nonsense. In every industry that exists, the owners / CEOs are entitled to talk to anybody that works in the company they run.

It’s actively encouraged by most management teams "
10884,Leicester City,And why do I care what this tosser says? 
10885,Leicester City,"Although Jordan aka homelander is a fascist twat hes correct on his comment about an owners interference. No he’s not. You should absolutely talk to the people most affected before making a decision like this. You know, the players."
10886,Leicester City,"Yep. Not impressed with Jordan’s comments these days. I disagree with almost everything he says on Talksport in the morning, lol"

10889,Leicester City,"No he’s not. You should absolutely talk to the people most affected before making a decision like this. You know, the players. Lol Absolute wank. Any club where the owners get involved is always a basket case.

10893,Leicester City,"Absolute wank. Any club where the owners get involved is always a basket case.

Some guy who sells duty free booze knows fuck all about training and running a football team. "
10894,Leicester City,"Leicester owner Aiyawatt ‘Top’ Srivaddhanaprabha will take more of a lead role in the club’s search for a new manager after being left unimpressed by the appointment of Steve Cooper.


As previously reported by talkSPORT, Top had reservations about hiring former Nottingham Forest boss Cooper right from the start of his tenure, but backed the judgement of long-serving director of football Jon Rudkin.


Top made the decision [personally to fire Cooper](https://talksport.com/football/2313236/leicester-city-sack-steve-cooper-graham-potter/) in the wake of Saturday’s 2-1 defeat at home to Chelsea.

And, while not the deciding factor, sources have told talkSPORT he was unimpressed with the 44-year-old’s scathing post-match attack on referee Andrew Madley.


The Thai businessman, who consulted senior Leicester players before making his decision to axe Cooper, had Graham Potter top of his wish-list to replace Enzo Maresca last summer but could not get the deal over the line.
 

With Potter again ruling himself out, former [Manchester United](https://talksport.com/sport/football/team/113099/manchester-united/) interim boss [Ruud van Nistelrooy](https://talksport.com/who/ruud-van-nistelrooy/) and West Brom’s Carlos Corberan are two of the leading candidates to succeed Cooper.

Once the new man is in place, Top also plans to have a major input in  
recruitment when the January window opens, with funds expected to be made available to fund Leicester’s Premier League survival bid. It's as if all of the words I enjoy the most coalesced into one article just in time to make my Christmas complete. I didn't realize that Cooper was Rudkin's choice - it's interesting to see Top exercise some power here. Hoping this is the start of the end for Rudkin as well 🤞🤞 If true, why is Rudkin still here?"
10895,Leicester City,"Top maybe finally realising that Rudkin is a part of the problem? Top loves Rudkin

Its a way to take heat off himself when the fans blame everything on Rudkin (notice how Rudkin never gets any credit for our good singings tbh, especially Mads) He can't fire himself."
10896,Leicester City,"I think (I have no evidence for this of course) that Rudkin became a bit of a father figure for Top after the tragedy and weaved his way into a more powerful position. Now time has passed and Vichai’s estate has been more sorted out Top is back in the driving seat and started to notice Rudkin isn’t the guy he makes himself out to be. 

Pure speculation of course "
10897,Leicester City,[deleted] Nobody is reporting it tbh
10898,Leicester City,It's as if all of the words I enjoy the most coalesced into one article just in time to make my Christmas complete. 
10899,Leicester City,"I didn't realize that Cooper was Rudkin's choice - it's interesting to see Top exercise some power here. Hoping this is the start of the end for Rudkin as well 🤞🤞 For real. Even if none of those things in the article are true, it clearly puts the blame solely on Rudkin for the mess the club finds itself in. Well he his now that he fell flat on his face.  Advantage of having underlings."
10900,Leicester City,"If true, why is Rudkin still here? Because top can shift the blame onto him whenever something goes wrong?"
10901,Leicester City,"Top loves Rudkin

Its a way to take heat off himself when the fans blame everything on Rudkin (notice how Rudkin never gets any credit for our good singings tbh, especially Mads) "
10902,Leicester City,He can't fire himself.

10904,Leicester City,"For real. Even if none of those things in the article are true, it clearly puts the blame solely on Rudkin for the mess the club finds itself in. What the man gets paid for apparently  Which is absolutely insane.

Rudkin isn't the owner of Leicester City football club"
10905,Leicester City,Well he his now that he fell flat on his face.  Advantage of having underlings. 
10906,Leicester City,Because top can shift the blame onto him whenever something goes wrong? Exactly what I was thinking 
10907,Leicester City,What the man gets paid for apparently  
10908,Leicester City,"Which is absolutely insane.

Rudkin isn't the owner of Leicester City football club "
10909,Leicester City,Exactly what I was thinking  
10910,Leicester City,"I'm also keen to hear people's thoughts, largely unproven, risky choice for a relegation scrap. Not that there's a great deal of proven relegation escape artists out there. I'd agree. He would feel a gamble for a medium-term manager (could be meh, could be outstanding much like when we hired Enzo) but in a relegation scrap it would feel a bit risky. Most important thing is that those at the club (players and staff) believe in whoever we hire."
10911,Leicester City,"Honestly, I think people are just wanting a change and he seems quite different to Cooper, whilst also being somewhat attainable.

He seems to play more positively than Cooper, but all those examples are with much stronger squads, so who knows if he'd be any different. 

Whether we get Ruud or Moyes or anyone else, I just hope they can find some form and bring in some impactful signings! If I were LCFC, I’d be interviewing him to see if he’d had any ideas for playing the players we have. He has a bit of advantage, having played us twice, and having had an incentive to get up to speed on us. Perhaps, but he should have some ideas. That’s the key. Everyone’s gonna be a risk. He’s not Cooper and that’s a positive. Can he do something different and succeed?  Have to get a good feeling from him. If not move on."
10912,Leicester City,Is cool. 
10913,Leicester City,Vibes based management is appealing with good enough vibes 
10914,Leicester City,"He's new, a risk that could pay off, a student of Sir Alex Ferguson, and that's all exciting for the future of the club, in the way that Enzo was and could have been if he'd stuck around.

That all said, personally I'm not a fan of taking a risk with a manager during the season itself, those types of appointments are best made in the summer with a good preseason for the incoming manager to really make an impact on club culture. Not sure I'd take student of Alex Ferguson too positively. Rooney, Neville, Scholes, Solskjaer, Roy Keane, Steve Bruce... The issue that I see in not taking the risk mid-season is that we end up signing a manager that is only capable of keeping us up, but we give home a 3 year deal!  Because that’s what Leicester do, isn’t it?

If we are going to give a manager a few year deal, I want someone that is making this an”project” with a plan and an identity. Cooper gave us zero identity. 

Now… we’re talking about RvN at the moment and people are right, he doesn’t have a ton of experience, but he was winning. Sure we got thumped by a United side with better players than us, but ten Haag had them only a few points above us. So getting them to work together doesn’t seem to be that easy. He did it… even Almiron had them struggle against Ipswich over the weekend."
10915,Leicester City,"The possibility of players wanting to sign for Leicester because ruud is the manager will be greater than someone like Cooper.

He is a risk but if he can attract players that normally wouldn't be interested in Leicester then that could be worth the risk giving him the job. "
10916,Leicester City,"I think whomever we bring in it should be either for a longer term project 2/3 years, improve playing style etc and if lucky keep us up so potentially a younger less proven manager. 
(eg RVN) 
Or short term rest of the season, just to keep us up. And pray Chelsea doesn’t snatch them up when they succeed!"
10917,Leicester City,"We are currently the level of club that an unproven, up and coming manager needs a chance to take control of to show what he’s really about. We’ve got nothing to persuade an experienced and valued manager to come on board, and Ruud did get United playing some decent football that neither his predecessor or successor has yet. I don’t think he’s *the* solution, but I think it’s a worthy fit given both our and his current situations. Also think he would have a good connection with the attacking players and maybe get some more creativity out of them. Leading by example, as it were."
10918,Leicester City,"His decent season in the Netherlands kinda showed that he's a tweaker type of manager who adapts to different opponents and prepares game plan by game plan instead of being a Russell Martin (my philosophy only) type of coach. Maybe that's what's needed no? Wasn't that part of the appeal of Cooper? I think that kind of approach works when you still have a central identity, which Cooper lacked. It seems like RVN has that but idk too much about him"
10919,Leicester City, Well according to odds we could be getting Jamie Vardy as the next manager so why not RVN 
10920,Leicester City,"I feel if you were to appoint Ruud, you're more looking at the plan of getting a newer manager in for the higher prospect of relegation, sticking with the team and then work on promotion. Rather than relegation and then leaving. 
He could of course work wonders and we prosper and stay up. 
Of course, it's all guess work and who knows what the higher ups have in mind. "
10921,Leicester City,"We're fucked, our problems run far deeper than Cooper, so at this point we may as well take a risk on a guy who has shown some promise. "
10922,Leicester City,"People just go for the obvious choices - like in the Summer loads of people thought we should go for Corberan.

If we go for RVN and slip into the relegation zone, the likelihood is he won’t get us out again because he has no experience in that situation. It is very, very rare that risks like that pay off for relegation threatened teams. "
10923,Leicester City,"I'm on board with the not wanting RVN.  Did alright for 4 games with manu, two against us, but not a large enough sample size for me.  Very little managerial experience and it's that experience and savvy that we're going to need to navigate staying up.

I sure hope the front office knows wtf their doing.  Sacking SC without a strong idea of who they were going to bring in seems misguided and worse than just keeping him imo.  Hindsight is 20/20, so I'm willing to wait and see who the appointment is, but the longer that this goes on with names falling off the list concerns me. "
10924,Leicester City,He’s handsome 
10925,Leicester City,Because fucking no one else wants to come. 
10926,Leicester City,"he’s not english. 

That’s it. "
10927,Leicester City,what about Mark Robbins ? 
10928,Leicester City,You should go for Potter although not sure he would be interested. If not Moyes is a safe choice to keep you in the league Club isn't interested in Potter or Moyes it's been reliably reported by multiple journos
10929,Leicester City,Wish it were Moyes.  
10930,Leicester City,Too late to get Emma Hayes? 
10931,Leicester City,"Just more exciting that Moyes or Potter isn’t it.

Moyes would keep us up, but not sure I want 3-4 years of his football at city… "
10932,Leicester City,"I'd agree. He would feel a gamble for a medium-term manager (could be meh, could be outstanding much like when we hired Enzo) but in a relegation scrap it would feel a bit risky. Most important thing is that those at the club (players and staff) believe in whoever we hire. "
10933,Leicester City,"If I were LCFC, I’d be interviewing him to see if he’d had any ideas for playing the players we have.

Key Individual Roles for Leicester City vs. Brentford

1. Mads Hermansen (Goalkeeper)

Role: Hermansen will need to organize the defense and anticipate Brentford’s dynamic attack, particularly Mbeumo’s ability to take quick shots. Strong positioning during set-pieces will also be critical.

Key Action: Quick distribution to trigger counters, aiming to exploit Brentford's high defensive line.


2. James Justin and Luke Thomas (Full-Backs)

Role: Tasked with controlling Brentford’s wingers and overlapping full-backs, Justin and Thomas must stay tight in defensive duels while supporting attacks on the flanks.

Key Action: Delivering accurate crosses and cutting off Mbeumo’s runs from wide areas into central positions.


3. Wout Faes and Jannik Vestergaard (Center-Backs)

Role: Central defenders must dominate aerially and maintain a high level of communication to neutralize Brentford’s set-piece threat and through balls.

Key Action: Timely clearances and marking Ivan Toney or Mbeumo in physical battles near the box.


4. Wilfred Ndidi (Defensive Midfield)

Role: Ndidi will act as a shield for the backline, intercepting passes and disrupting Brentford’s playmakers.

Key Action: Shadowing Bryan Mbeumo during transitions and initiating Leicester's counters with sharp passes forward.


5. Harry Winks (Central Midfield)

Role: Winks will control the tempo, recycle possession, and look for diagonal passes to stretch Brentford’s defense.

Key Action: Maintaining composure under pressure and playing progressive passes to bypass the midfield press.


6. Kelechi Iheanacho (Attacking Midfield)

Role: Iheanacho needs to create scoring opportunities and link up with the striker. He can also take advantage of gaps in Brentford’s midfield to shoot from range.

Key Action: Drifting into half-spaces to combine with wingers and pulling defenders out of position.


7. Stephy Mavididi (Left Wing)

Role: Mavididi’s pace and direct dribbling will be crucial to pin back Brentford’s full-backs and deliver crosses into the box.

Key Action: Exploiting Brentford’s vulnerability to wide attacks and cutting inside to shoot.


8. Dewsbury-Hall (Central/Left Midfield)

Role: Combining defensive work rate with attacking creativity, Dewsbury-Hall will help in transitions and look for quick switches of play.

Key Action: Supporting overlaps with Mavididi and Justin while attempting shots from outside the box.


9. Patson Daka (Striker)

Role: If fit, Daka’s speed will be pivotal in exploiting the space behind Brentford’s defense. He should focus on making timed runs onto through balls.

Key Action: Finishing from close range and pressing the opposition defenders when out of possession.



---

Tactical Execution

Leicester’s counterattacking structure should rely on Mavididi and Daka’s pace while ensuring defensive solidity with Ndidi and Winks protecting the central areas. With proper execution, Leicester can frustrate Brentford and hit them on the break."
10962,Leicester City,"Third time, was in fact, not the charm

However this seems to suggest we haven’t tried, not that he has rejected us so that means he isn’t even first choice. I imagine we don’t like that he rejected us previously. Yep."

I think not.


My schizo view is that:  Top already had verbal agreement with RvN that's why he's so confident to sack cooper this fast, but LCFC will wait for 2-3 more days before making official statement so it won't be looking too disrespectful for cooper. 

Only the matters of time now."

Role: If fit, Daka’s speed will be pivotal in exploiting the space behind Brentford’s defense. He should focus on making timed runs onto through balls.

Key Action: Finishing from close range and pressing the opposition defenders when out of possession.

Tactical Execution

Leicester’s counterattacking structure should rely on Mavididi and Daka’s pace while ensuring defensive solidity with Ndidi and Winks protecting the central areas. With proper execution, Leicester can frustrate Brentford and hit them on the break. Lineup:

10985,Leicester City,"6 days ago, @indykaila( same T4 guy that talk about chelsea and enzo) reported that LCFC management team had been in contact with Ruud about possible appointments in case coopers gone. 4 days later cooper is sacked, coincidence? I think not.


My schizo view is that:  Top already had verbal agreement with RvN that's why he's so confident to sack cooper this fast, but LCFC will wait for 2-3 more days before making official statement so it won't be looking too disrespectful for cooper. 

Only the matters of time now. "

Leicester City’s tactical approach against Brentford should consider Brentford’s strengths, including their aggressive attacking style at home and the form of key players like Bryan Mbeumo. Here’s how Leicester can prepare:

Defensive Strategy

1. Compact Midfield and Defense:
Leicester must limit space in central areas where Brentford thrive in build-up play. A narrow defensive shape with Wilfred Ndidi and Harry Winks screening the backline can disrupt Brentford's attacking rhythm.


2. Set-Piece Organization:
Brentford often capitalize on set-pieces. Leicester’s defenders, such as Wout Faes and Jannik Vestergaard, need to assert aerial dominance and maintain discipline in marking.


3. Control Wide Areas:
Brentford rely on their wingers to stretch play. Full-backs James Justin and Luke Thomas should stay tight to the opposition wingers, cutting off supply lines to Mbeumo and others.



Transition Play

1. Quick Counterattacks:
Brentford’s high pressing can leave gaps in behind. Leicester can exploit this with quick transitions. Stephy Mavididi’s pace on the left and Patson Daka’s speed (if fit) up front are key to creating scoring opportunities.


2. Target Brentford’s High Line:
Brentford’s defense can be vulnerable to balls over the top. Leicester’s creative players like Dewsbury-Hall and Iheanacho should look to release runners into space.



Offensive Setup

1. Exploit Brentford’s Defensive Gaps:
While Brentford score freely, they also concede. Leicester should focus on maintaining possession in advanced areas and drawing defenders out of position.


2. Shooting from Range:
Brentford's goalkeepers have shown vulnerability to long-range shots. Players like Dewsbury-Hall can test them from outside the box.



Key Matchup: Leicester’s Defense vs. Bryan Mbeumo

Mbeumo’s movement and finishing ability make him Brentford’s most dangerous player. Assigning Ndidi to shadow him in transitions could minimize his impact.

If Leicester can combine defensive resilience with incisive counterattacks, they have a good chance to disrupt Brentford’s home dominance despite their current form."
10988,Leicester City,West Ham AGAIN?

10992,Leicester City,"My conspiracy theory is that we fired Cooper knowing Ruud was a legit possibility, but couldnt finish the deal until we fired Cooper. 

Ruud clearly wants another chance at managing. After ETH was fired, there was a lot of Ruud hype, that then doubled after he creamed us twice. Im guessing a lot of this was his agent building him up. It was reported before Amorim was hired he would leave once a new manager was in, which I read to mean he was posturing for the ManU job, but didnt get it.

So now, he’s left looking for the best opportunity, and our guys are hoping we can offer him that. As bad as we’ve looked this season, Leicester might be a good job for him, cause our players arent terrible comparitively imo. There’s hamburg rumors now, which are a threat as its a former club. But we offer top flight football, and both us and Hamburg give him the chance to actually make his mark and be a decision maker (at least hopefully).

Now it prolly comes down to if he wants us or Hamburg, which I honestly would understand either way. If its us, the negiotations might take a bit cause he has leverage, which might be the delay "
10993,Leicester City,"Would rather get a defender, but if he doesn't suck, it will be acceptable. "
10994,Leicester City,"This is the rumor mill on steroids, as it is regarding transfer rumors.  I will say whomever the appointment is will shed light on whether it was wise to sack SC. 


Would seem so foolish to have done so without some semblance of a plan regarding whom to hire.  "

10998,Leicester City,"Remember how happy everyone was when we sacked cooper

That lasted all of 10 minutes, we'll be manager less at the weekend and appoint some unproven nobody eventually I think many of us were more confused than happy with Coopers dismissal. The timing is very strange. We don't seem to have a plan... 

It obviously takes time to get a squad to assimilate to a plan, and strategy... while Cooper didn't really seem to have a plan or strategy that was clear or apparent, he did seem to have the ability to get us to turn it around at half time. 

Our squad is clearly not at the caliber of most PL teams. The talent level is just not there. Aside from Vardy, Mads, Fac-Buo, and maybe Periera who hasn't seen enough minutes to prove me right or wrong. 

I would happily have given Cooper until at least January.  Maybe I'm in the minority tho."

Why would he take a job at a burning fire of shite when he could wait for his Chelsea money to run out and go to West Ham who seem more stable. We're in a much better situation than we were, and the imjury list is temporary. Only Fatawu is long term."
11031,Leicester City,"So Cooper was fired with no one lined up ready to go?

Top's/Rudkin's contact list seems to be tiny, I assume we get the WBA manager at this point. I think they made the decision after watching the first twenty minutes of the Man United game. Convinced me."

As such I can't wait until we announce Wayne Rooney following the Wealdstone Raider turning us down.

Guys waiting for a better option, sank under pressure at Chelsea and took him ages to get over it.  Hasn’t never had scrutiny at Brighton and what makes u think he could handle relegation scrap with Leicester, plus knows if he gets relegated kiss goodbye the England/decent job again. 
Doesn’t seem to back himself.  

On a last note, I think he waits for West Ham job before the Christmas run in of games The thing is though, that the longer he leaves it, the bigger his unemployment gap, and the less desirable he becomes to any big club with an opening, especially when his time at Chelsea didn't exactly go well.

At some point, if he has high ambitions, he needs to take a job, anywhere."
11078,Leicester City,It’s like an abusive relationship with Potter. Why the f do we keep going back to him?  God I hate this front office. 
11079,Leicester City,"Why would he want a job he clearly didnt want over the summer? I'm fairly sure if he had been interested we would have picked him over Cooper. I’ve got a mate who was working at the training ground during pre-season. Potter was in multiple days whereas from what he saw, Cooper was only in once.

I do think Potter was just unsure of the points deduction. Because he would have thought he was getting a points deduction and probably had his eyes on the England job. Neither of which are happening now. 

As for this “he wants his own DOF” nonsense. No way is a man walking into an interview and telling said interviewer “I want to put a man in your place if you hire me” that’s fucking insane. He wanted his own DOF. Rudkin didn’t want that …"

Potter isn’t my first choice personally anyway unless we can back him massively in January. But I think circumstances have changed enough and we must have already been in contact with him unless the sacking was completely knee jerk from top which is slightly concerning if so."

Maybe I'm just trying to tempt fate because I do think Potter would be a good choice but I just don't see it happening. I agree I think Potter was always the clubs and from what I’ve seen a lot of city fans too, you’ll always get some that disagree of course.

I Dont see him going for it now even with points deduction gone. I think Potter carries a lot of demands for a structured approach that would mean change at the top. And I don’t see that happening. Although I think it should. 

Moyes would organise and get them going but won’t be pretty on eye. 

RVN he did ok at PSV but fell out with Hierarchy unsure of his style lacks experience. 

Those are probably the picks the club are looking at as they’re out of work. 

Guess you could go for Robins, who I like or a foreign maverick outsider. Or pay the money for Will Still. But I’d imagine the club won’t go down this road as too risky or expensive."
11096,Leicester City,"Agreed, although this time he might be holding out for West Ham, so hopefully they win today… 😂 "
11097,Leicester City,"Cooper was definitely not first choice, he was just the most willing to take the job on, which he must always be given credit for of course. 

Potter isn’t my first choice personally anyway unless we can back him massively in January. But I think circumstances have changed enough and we must have already been in contact with him unless the sacking was completely knee jerk from top which is slightly concerning if so. "

Will still is a good/bold shout. They wont shift or demote Rudkin, the family that owns the club seem to value having people around them they trust, a close circle, Rudkin has managed to get into that.  Same reason Whelan wont be going anywhere either.  I think at most would be someone allowed to come in under Rudkin.  Like Rodgers had."
11099,Leicester City,Will still is a good/bold shout. But a pipe dream at that x
11100,Leicester City,"They wont shift or demote Rudkin, the family that owns the club seem to value having people around them they trust, a close circle, Rudkin has managed to get into that.

11101,Leicester City,But a pipe dream at that x 
11102,Leicester City,"Clutching at straws but:

- Brought in Jordan Ayew who has probably repaid his own fee already. 
- Got some kind of tune out of Soumare who is actually tracking back and winning challenges now. 
- Convinced Buonanotte to sign on loan, who has been good. Disagree with Soumare. Has still been at fault for so many goals. Has no positional awareness, second goal on Saturday was due to him not pressing the ball as per.

Agree on the rest. You are delusional if you think Soumare is playing well and absolutely nuts if you think he is tracking back.  But you did say you are grasping at straws.  I agree Ayew was a good pickup (as a sub), but he also got another striker who doesn't even play and I doubt he had anything to do with Buonanotte."
11103,Leicester City,"Took us on when we were facing the points deduction and with no real prospect of improving the side.
I didn't think he was the right fit, but at least he was willing to have a go. He's getting paid either way lol. Not like he did it out of charity"
11104,Leicester City,"He appeared to instill some fight in them. A number of games this season we haven't given up and kept trying to create something. I'll give him that. It was only really the only thing, but last few games they don't seem to work for him any longer."
11105,Leicester City,"For most games we actually didn’t just roll over and die once we conceded, which was a problem under BR and Enzo. 

We scored in every game bar one.

Probably is the reason we have Ayew.

Made Soumare look a bit better. "
11106,Leicester City,only thing i noticed was we didn’t give up as much in the injury time. that was something that was costing us points last season but now we’ve got more points by being more critical in that last stages of the games and that’s something we rarely did last season 
11107,Leicester City,I did like the fact that you could understand what he said. 
11108,Leicester City,He was a nice bloke There you go.
11109,Leicester City,Got sacked. 
11110,Leicester City,"Brought us back into games which other managers wouldn't have been able to, Southampton in particular, but also to another extent arsenal, Ipswich and spurs. Issue is, he only “brought us back in” against 10 men when it comes to Southampton and Ipswich. Arsenal was frustrating because we got back in then he told them to cower behind the 18 yard line again when that was how we had just conceded 2 goals prior to carrying any threat. 

Spurs however he did change it at half time but that may have been more Spurs and more first game of the season stuff than any tactical nouse. Right, totally orchestrated red card.  Brilliant."
11111,Leicester City,I don’t think we conceded a goal from a backpass once That's probably because we hoof it up to no one in particular even under zero pressure United's 5th in the cup
11112,Leicester City,"Had the team show fight at times and kept us competitive in almost every game (only exception is Man U and I'm writing off the Carabao Cup because we fielded such a weak team). To be fair, our fixture list has been comparatively easy and we haven't had the opportunity to get smashed by the likes of Liverpool and Man City yet Man City ain't doing any smashing at the min.

A beautiful sight"
11113,Leicester City,"I thought he was pretty good in the media to start with. Kind of convinced me could return to the days of pressing or at least a resilient type of football. 

By the end every loss was a referee’s fault, and not the lacklustre performances that you’d see basically every time. Agreed he talked a good talk, just didn't walk a good walk."
11114,Leicester City,"Arsenal fan here but I have a soft spot for Leicester. 

Does the fanbase genuinely want Moyes? You have a good chance of survival if he attacks it like the West Ham job. But if he comes in with the same attitude as he did at Sunderland, then Leicester will go down. And either way, the football is going to be atrocious.

Intrigued to hear Leicester fans opinions. Other than a random 33 y/o German coach from the second division, the choice is quite limited. I really didn't want Moyes in the summer but I never expected we'd sink to Cooper. If we do get Moyes the best bit will be the amount of control he'll want to rake away from Rudkin who's the real problem at the club. I wouldn't mind him at all now. i mean hey, speaking as a brighton fan, our 30-something german coach from the second division has worked well for us lmao"
11115,Leicester City,Side often stays in games even if they don’t look like controlling them much. That is what has kept us above so far. Honestly I don’t even think you can say Cooper has done a terrible job so far which gives a credit to the club for being proactive since the players don’t seem to believe in him regardless of the decent results. Cooper has done a terrible job at Managing a football club because he is incompetent.  No one said he isn't trying.
11116,Leicester City,Front office set him up for failure. We have a championship level squad and no amount of 4 month coaching will change that. If anyone expected more points than we currently have so far they are delusional.  Locker room needs to find stability and changing everything up now sure isn’t it. I expect things will only get worse. 
11117,Leicester City,Currently 16th with the absolute worst squad in the league. I doubt our squad is worse then southampton or even ipswich
11118,Leicester City,A nice guy and good manager that was shafted by a leadership and contingent of fans whose perception of the team is not situated within reality. There’s a massive difference between the perception of the team and actually looking like you want to win a football match every once in a while. Every other team around us looks far more ambitious with less resources.
11119,Leicester City,Left 
11120,Leicester City,"Biggest one has to be the late goals. 

I don’t really recall us ever being a team that scores lots of late goals. Under Rodgers we were more often on the receiving end. That’s the one part of his tenure I hope we can continue - though hopefully with a general, lower reliance on them in the first place.  Teams were surprised we had some offensive punch based in how disorganized we were.  I guess you could have said that was a good thing, but something tells me people would have figured it out as season went on."
11121,Leicester City,"Good Pressers. Better than all our recent gaffers. Honest, too much to his detriment at times. "
11122,Leicester City,we didnt blow a dozen results in the last minute of the match 
11123,Leicester City,He was very good at moaning about refs and getting the benefit of some very dodgy decisions such as in the Southampton and Ipswich games. 
11124,Leicester City,He spoke positively in press conferences without saying anything of actual substance. 
11125,Leicester City,Got the mighty reds promoted 💪🏻 
11126,Leicester City,"As a palace fan, i think this is a really bad decision longevity wise. This man would’ve kept you up, yes the football isn’t pretty but staying up and then building is a much better idea than risking now. You are literally above us in the league and we’ve been in the prem 10 years 😂😂Think it’s a silly move personally, Also big up my Ghanaian prince jordan ayew 😏 Everything you said was stupid.  Is there a reason fans of other teams like to come here and get in our businesses.  For example, I know nothing if Palace but that they are perennially poor."
11127,Leicester City,"Cooper didn't do A LOT wrong. And our results and position in the table aren't terrible and deservable of a sack. But I'm happy he's gone so we can find a better manager.

Let's be fair to him, he:
▪️Had the balls to take the club when were facing a points deduction

▪️Put some fight into the squad

▪️Got us to score in every game so far bar one

▪️Was able to talk to the players at half time, inspiring some commendable comebacks

▪️Brought players in like Buonanotte, Skipp and Ayew who have been decent for the team

▪️Got Soumaré looking pretty decent (but maybe his loan was good to him) Those are all just made up and not one is confirmable or even correct."
11128,Leicester City,"Collecting his belongings likely today CooperFC fans in the mud

I love it!!"
11129,Leicester City,"Disagree with Soumare. Has still been at fault for so many goals. Has no positional awareness, second goal on Saturday was due to him not pressing the ball as per.

Agree on the rest. I did say ""clutching at straws""

If he can put in 10-15 solid games, then we can have a fairer assessment of him. And yet he was probably our best player on Saturday (which isn't saying much) He has certainly not been at fault for any of the goals we've conceded since Cooper started playing him."

11151,Leicester City,"He has certainly not been at fault for any of the goals we've conceded since Cooper started playing him. Some of you need to open your eyes up and actually watch players off the ball movement/positioning.

Watch the highlights of the following goals:

- fernandes first against United
- Garnacho against United 
- Enzo against Chelsea 
- Casemiro against United (cup)

(I’d also be willing to argue the Garnacho cup goal too as Soumare reacts to the danger far too late for a premier league player, but I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt on that one because it’s down the right hand side, Thomas is out of position also and I feel like the above is enough to stress my point anyway).

In each of these, they come from the right CM position because Soumare isn’t pressing the ball, is slow to react and allows the shot/cross to be made under zero pressure. That’s 4 goals in our last 3 games. 

Not good enough, and if you’re happy to watch your CM be that lazy then that’s a you problem. He doesn’t wear his heart on his sleeve, doesn’t press in line with his teammates, and ultimately doesn’t know where the fuck he is supposed to be on the pitch.

I’ve taken some solid time out of my day to put this comprehensive review together for you folks. Please come back with a response that isn’t “but but he’s being scapegoated”."

11160,Leicester City,What reputation? If you know football you’d know he has a great reputation after his time at Forrest
11161,Leicester City,This sub is especially bad for delusional people who obsess over terrible managers that should be sacked. Happened with puel happened with Rodgers and now happening with cooper Brendan Rodger’s is not only one of our most successful managers in terms of silverware.

11163,Leicester City,"He consistently resisted the press which allowed us to advance the ball up the field and have at least some control in the game. 

You've got to admit he had a solid game I dont have to admit that at all. We had no control over 90% of the game, and a large reason for that was because our midfield was non-existent. The first 35 minutes we didn’t even get out our half. Obviously Ndidi and Winks/Skipp are equally to blame, but you can’t say Soumare stood out. The fact that he was at fault for the goal was just the cherry on top. I thought Soumare was the reason our press failed. Everytime our forward players pressed (led by Vardy), Soumare was miles away from his man in midfield which made it so easy for Chelsea to play out.

A press only works if the whole team do it, there's no point the 3 attackers pressing and leaving an opposition midfielder with acres of space to receive the ball.

Soumare has always been lazy, he just isn't up to the intensity required for premier league football."
11164,Leicester City,If you know football you’d know he has a great reputation after his time at Forrest Plus he managed the england under 19 team that won the youth wc Well he cashed that out and got exposed.  That's over. 1 win in your final 15 matches with a team will do that

The proven manager criteria keeps the same old under performers rotating through time and time again doing the same old thing. Wasn't Cooper a 'proven manager?' The same old thinking will yield the same old results. Every manager is unproven at some point and when they join a new team they all start unproven and a risk.

1. Moyes has the experience, has nothing to prove but does he really have the motivation to join a relegation scrap at this stage of his career. 

2. Potter didn't want the job in the summer, has been out of work for a considerable time and still doesn't appear to be in any rush to start managing. Again does he have the motivation or hunger to join a relegation scrap. 

3. Whilst RVN is a risk, he's up and coming, motivated and hungry to make a success of a managerial career. 

Everyone on here and FT thought Enzo would fail and be sacked at  Chelsea before Xmas.

Right but - again - Brighton can afford to take a risk on a manager, AND they do a lot more due diligence than we do. 

We cannot afford to risk an unproven manager and for it to go wrong, especially when we’ve already sacked one this season."

We cannot afford to risk an unproven manager and for it to go wrong, especially when we’ve already sacked one this season. When do you think we would be able to “afford” to take a risk? Why do you think Moyes (who is actually my first choice) wouldn’t be any risk? Literally anyone we appoint carries risk. Then the issue is the board not doing enough due diligence not that we are or are not taking a risk. 

I mean Forest got a manager sacked by Spurs and sacked my Wolves, which was a pretty big risk imo, which again didn’t do too badly and they very much couldn’t “afford to”. Or do you just define risk by number of games managed? 

How do you define proven? What does “proven” actually even mean? You can cherry pick any manager and point out how they are or are not proven. They need to fit the style of play the players and wants alike want and they need to be willing to work with what they have, whether they are “proven” or not can be argued for months on end."

11189,Leicester City,"Can spot JJ, Hamza, VK, Coady, Iversen (?), Winks, apparently Vesty was there too. 

Probably a good thing he was sacked then, cause you're not doing this sort of stuff if you don't actively hate him. Of course Hamza misses him, Enzo made him captain after he was caught drink driving, which is gross Is there a photo? I couldn't see one in the article, although tbf I can't speak danish Well if reports are true that he fell out with Vesty, Winks and Choudhury then that makes sense. Coopers had arguments with Winks, Hamza and Vestergod so you can read between the lines. Yup, you could aee the players gave him a chance and played hard at the beginning of the year, then kind of gave up on him.

Surely isn’t it recovery, then day off, and back in the training ground Monday?
Flight/late night/flight back can’t be great before Monday training, especially with a bunch of players who just came back from international break. According to one of the Cooper sacking articles, the squad wasn't expected back for training til Tuesday, so that would explain it. Jetting from probably Birmingham or a private airfield to Copenhagen shouldn't take longer than two hours, so they'd probably be back by now anyway. People on twitter are saying it's their Christmas party. No source though so could be BS They probably went there a few hours after the game.

11193,Leicester City,"from the article

  
You wouldn't think that Leicester had anything to celebrate after Saturday's defeat to Chelsea's 2-1 defeat. The Premier League promoters are now dangerously close to the relegation zone with 16 points after 12 games.

Still, several of the stars were in a party mood. And it took place at the Museo nightclub in inner Copenhagen.

Ekstra Bladet has obtained a video from the exclusive nightclub, where several stars seem to have forgotten all about the sporting downturn.

  
To the tunes of Kanye West's 'All of the lights', midfielder Harry Winks dances with a big smile with teammate Conor Coady inside the club surrounded by other guests.

According to Ekstra Bladet's information, the Danish national team stars and Leicester players Jannik Vestergaard and Victor Kristiansen were also to be found at Museo. "
11194,Leicester City,"Christmas party. 

But they have been aware what was coming. "
11195,Leicester City,pathetic. maybe they want to sit in the stands with KDH? 
11196,Leicester City,"Is there anyone from the team actually associated with holding the sign?  Looks to me like it would be an electronic hand held sign and probably property of the bar.  I would speculate that the control over the sign wording might be wifi from the bar, and any moderately knowledgeable fan might have requested for the message to be posted on the sign.  Seems logical, does it not, that knowing some players are there one of the say fifty or so other customers would have put that message there? Link to Club Museo, which name is prominently displayed on the electronic sign:  [MUSEO](https://www.museoclub.com/)  Sign belongs to Museo, therefore.

11201,Leicester City,I don’t understand what these players are hoping to achieve.  They are Maddison or Barnes or even KDH level good.  They are not moving on to better situations with relegation.  If their unifying thing is to celebrate a manager’s sacking given how shitty the players have played I honestly don’t know what a new manager will do.  Like especially those players at the back who have looked like they don’t know the game in very obvious situations where the manager can’t be blamed.

On the other hand, maybe the board are just mental (probably.) Probably just wishful thinking, but it is very odd timing given our league position, and the history of the club backing managers for as long as they possibly can.

I think it’s either we’ve got a new manager lined up, with staff, or Cooper had a major falling out with Top and had to leave."

Could tell we changed up after the Southampton Win, Ricardo gets in the team from nowhere, and suddenly we playing more expansive (even though that may not have been obvious with our struggles), I suspect Top was starting to have input and this eventually led to a big falling out, obviously Top owns the club, he wins and Cooper is out the door.

I think Top has had this problem for a while, we all remember e.g. Rodgers would change things up, we would win a few games, but then suddenly we would revert to what we were calling Rodgers ball, I now have the opinion Top was interfering all the way back then.

When Rodgers was sacked, under the caretakers, first game, it was nothing like Top tippy tappy ball, second game they suddenly changed it up, very bizarre, only explained by intervention, Similar with Smith, initially different, then it suddenly changed.

Kudos to Top, maybe he’s finally becoming the ruthless businessman we need him to be. >We must have a replacement lined up if we’ve pulled the trigger on him relatively early.


I wouldn't be so sure, this is the same club that fell for a crypto scam I agree. No reason to make the change just for changes sake. They must have someone in mind.  I don’t think you guys understand our club. It wouldn’t surprise me to be manager-less for at least a month No, Bourne says we're not expecting a quick appointment 

So it sounds like the process is starting again - Lasting interest in Potter? Steady hand of Moyes? Rolling the dice with RvN? >We must have a replacement lined up if we’ve pulled the trigger on him relatively early.

>Kudos to Top, 

I'm not so sure what makes you so sure of that. We could just not have a manager, not that it would be such a terrible thing. Nope. If a replacement was lined up it would have been leaked weeks ago. Like Amorim with United."

11256,Leicester City,"A bit surprised by this. I like SC. Seems a nice guy and talked a good game. I will say if a change was to be made, I'm glad it's made this early, with enough time for the new manager to implement their system fully and have every chance to keep us up Reasonable take as always Camel. I’ve also always been of the camp of he seems like a good bloke and all that, but the football was declining week in week out. 

Seeing Vardy have a go at him after he came off yesterday I thought something was falling apart within too. 

Like you said, glad we’ve just shown some bottle and bit the bullet, need to back whoever comes in now. Did he really talk a good game? He mostly spent his time whining about refereeing decisions (to the point that he had more yellow cards than wins in all competitions while in charge of us). He spoke like a fan on a matchday, and while i get why that might be endearing, it shows him to be a rank fucking amateur as a manager."

11259,Leicester City,"Surprised tbh, and I can’t say I’m entirely on board… I’m not sure if there’s any manager who can drag this squad to survival especially given fatawu is out and our crippling lack of squad depth Better to back a new manager that’s more ambitious with the January window than the constant negativity and fan revolts imo."
11260,Leicester City,"Praise the Lord. Should never have been him in the first place.

Now if we could stop making terrible decisions that would be brilliant, cheers Top. Who should it have been? All the managers that we couldn’t afford, and all those who didn’t want us?!"
11261,Leicester City,"Then we have a chance. A slim one but the odds on survival just increased. Should’ve happened the minute the lawyers prevented the points deduction. Next appointment is crucial. You wanted him sacked before he managed a match?

At the end of the day, hes left us above relegation (just) any half decent manager should keep us up with ease. 

Would be a different story if we were like 6 points off safety"
11262,Leicester City,Thanks god. We were not going to stay out of the relegation zone if this continued as is. 
11263,Leicester City,Bruh 
11264,Leicester City,"Sadly I’m not surprised, I hope we have plan B and they have somebody lined up straight away and don’t delay I bloody hope so, but I won’t be getting my hopes up. 

As you say it’s not really surprising and I feel the club has done this as they have to be seen to be something different from our relegation. 

However just like Rogers there seems no immediate contingency"
11265,Leicester City,I didn’t want him in the first place but it was so obvious in pre season this had to happen to give us any chance of staying up that it blows my mind that anyone out there wasn’t calling for this all season. 
11266,Leicester City,"Absolutely over the moon that we've stepped up and done it before he dragged us deep into trouble.

The big Cooper supporters who downvoted every comment criticising him earlier in the season have gone very quiet recently - would love to hear their take. Lets not get so ahead of ourselves until we see who the new manager is and until we see if they can actually get results At the end of the day you were above relegation which is the only objective this season 

Everyone who wants Moyes clearly doesn’t remember how offensively poor he was and potter isn’t the man to keep a relegation team up 

Everyone else either won’t come to Leicester or Leicester can’t afford to employ them My take is we better effing win the league now with how everyone bitched and blamed all of our problems on him"
11267,Leicester City,Damn didn't see that coming 
11268,Leicester City,Holy shit just heard it announced at the end of the Liverpool game

11273,Leicester City,"You really wonder if Top is trying to make up for sacking Brendan far too late by being extra ruthless with SC.

Nevertheless, right decision. Given how we were playing I could really have seen us going on a losing streak that would have crippled our season. "

11275,Leicester City,"[deleted] We have 2 wins in 12 and one of them came from a miraculous last minute winner against a horrible Saints side from Ayew. We’d have lost to Ipswich as well if it wasn’t for another very late equalizer from him.

11286,Leicester City,"I'm surprised this happened before Christmas, but the game yesterday was dreadful. One shot and it's a pk in the 95th is just not the level we should be at with the players we have "
11287,Leicester City,Can he take Ruskin with him. 
11288,Leicester City,🎉🎉 
11289,Leicester City,"A great Sunday, such a shame they wasted the whole international break Hopefully they have been working behind the scenes in preparation.  But in reality I doubt it."
11290,Leicester City,Oh wow go Foxes we will find the right fit 
11291,Leicester City,"I can't believe we did it so quickly. Not because I thought he should stay, he was shite in my opinion, but all precedent says that we wait far too long to sack anybody. This needs to have been done with a plan, I hope we've not gone impulsively He wasn't exactly sacked to early base upon performance.  After the second pre-season game might have been quickly  Any time after that would have been justified "
11292,Leicester City,"As someone that's preached patience this whole season, it was time. The fit was not right, best to admit a mistake and move on than be stubborn into oblivion. "
11293,Leicester City,[deleted] We would have been had Palace got a result (which they weren’t far off) and Ipswich today.
11294,Leicester City,Southgate incoming Dear lord
11295,Leicester City,Blimey Charlie 
11296,Leicester City,"Really not messing about. Hope we have a good replacement lined up.

As for Cooper, I’m grateful for the decent start to the season and hope he lands on his feet elsewhere.

Think Potter or Moyes are the best bets. "
11297,Leicester City,Bet forest are pissing themselves 😜 
11298,Leicester City,Thank you Sweet Jesus. Forget the play. If I had to listen to one more of his dizzying post match pressers. He and Ten Hag could put lipstick on a pig all day long. Good riddance. 
11299,Leicester City,What is the thinking around getting in a championship manager? Is it unheard of ? There are a few out of a job who might commit to this team and bring a philosophy Mark Robbin's comes to mind. This hiring proves it's far more important you analyze their skills as a coach rather than their past experience.
11300,Leicester City,"Back to ugly man contests, I suppose. "
11301,Leicester City,"After learning the lesson of waiting too long with Roger’s, only to go far the other way and sacking a man because he lost Chelsea, Man U twice and an in form forest? 

Yeah the draw against Ipswich ain’t ideal, but it’s not like you have the squad you had 2 seasons ago (even last season kdh was about) 

He’s got you wins vs other relegation rivals and Bournemouth. And scoring regularly. "
11302,Leicester City,"Won’t make a blind bit of difference.

When you squad options involve:

Daka, Kristiansen, Faes, El Khanouss, Justin, Soumare, Ndidi, Ward, Edouard, Decordova-Reid….

Doesn’t matter who the manager is. I actually think it will .no one was going to fight for cooper. If we go down fighting in the next 28 matches I'll suck it up. Cooper just doesn't instill ""Fixes never quit"" Why are you here?"
11303,Leicester City,"I was surprised to see this. Just off an intl break too. Personally, I’d have let him have more matches but I won’t miss him. I think in normal circumstances he wouldn’t have been sacked. But with how negative the tactics were I think that just tipped it over the edge. If we had had a go against Chelsea or at least looked like an organised system I don’t think he would have been sacked."
11304,Leicester City,"Well, I wasn't expecting this. Let's hope we have a replacement quickly "
11305,Leicester City,"I feel indifferent about this. We are exactly where the level of the players suggests we should be. 

Of the starting 11. Mads could play in a top-half Prem team, and that's probably it. 

Everyone else is bottom-half of the PL, or Championship level, or injured. 

This team's level is relegation battle. I would be shocked if a different manager gets better results, but we live in hope.. Not Ipswich. Just watched them manhandle MU. They're coming for us. Agreed. The performances up the last 3 fixtures, two of which were against a resurgent United & then Chelsea have all had some positives. If you look at where we are in the league that’s probably  exactly where you’d have predicted us at the start of the season. Between now and up to the Jan window I can’t see another manager getting much more out of this same group of players. 

That said I can understand the criticisms re style of play and substitutions. Also, longer term I don’t think Cooper was ever to be the answer.

I reckon Top is haunted by that least season under Rodgers and the delay in sacking him and is determined not to make the same error of judgement this time round! I'm so sick of this bullshit."
11306,Leicester City,"If it is to be Van Nistelroy please make it quick. I think we should try to play entertaining football, and not worry so much about staying up. Let that fall where it falls. We’ve now got too many injuries to have much choice in team selection. Entertain the fans. Make chances where you can. Solid defense if you can. Be interesting.  Don’t worry about survival. Foxes never quit. Don’t don’t get survival in your mind. "
11307,Leicester City,Idk how to feel about this. I don’t think Cooper had good tactics at all but our roster is so limited. I hope we can find someone good to keep us up. Why the downvotes tho?
11308,Leicester City,"This is insane, never expected this Insane is to keep hitting your head into the wall over and over again."
11309,Leicester City,"I see no chance of us staying up now. Need to build stability and consistency after Enzo’s departure. This is not it.  I’m sure I’ll get downvoted and firing Cooper seemed popular, but that’s fine.   Point wise we are exactly where we are expected to be. "
11310,Leicester City,"I called this firing exactly for today, Sunday, in a comment on yesterday‘s game. It would’ve been either today or Monday. Having seen how angry Vardy was in being subbed, I thought that was the death knell. Also, the commentators in the US broadcast were down on Steve from seeing twenty minutes of the beginning of the broadcast. They were equipped with all the relevant background and arguments. They were not just calling the game, they became partisan fans of removing Steve.  If Top was watching with this commentary he would have been influenced. 

I too became firmly Cooper out during this game and thought it should happen today. "
11311,Leicester City,Lets go for Dyche… Or not 
11312,Leicester City,"Horrendous decision imo, who’s going to come in and turn things around with the barebones team we have? No chance any ‘good’ managers are going to look at this project and be interested. Potter no chance, we’ll end up with dean Smith again and Rock bottom in May the only horrendous decision was to appoint this league one standard clown in the first place."
11313,Leicester City,Idiots. 
11314,Leicester City,Neither and while im not a fan of what coopers done so far I wonder if it’s the right decision. Feels pretty doomed for whoever comes in next. We have no pl quality striker no pl quality defense(except for gk) and one of our 2 decent wingers  is out for the seasons. Did Vardy just retire or something? Whoever is in needs backing in January for sure though.
11315,Leicester City,">We must have a replacement lined up if we’ve pulled the trigger on him relatively early.


I wouldn't be so sure, this is the same club that fell for a crypto scam In fairness, if they took bc games money before the bankruptcy, then we're laughing"
11316,Leicester City,I agree. No reason to make the change just for changes sake. They must have someone in mind.  
11317,Leicester City,I don’t think you guys understand our club. It wouldn’t surprise me to be manager-less for at least a month 
11318,Leicester City,"No, Bourne says we're not expecting a quick appointment 

So it sounds like the process is starting again - Lasting interest in Potter? Steady hand of Moyes? Rolling the dice with RvN? "
11319,Leicester City,">We must have a replacement lined up if we’ve pulled the trigger on him relatively early.

>Kudos to Top, 

I'm not so sure what makes you so sure of that. We could just not have a manager, not that it would be such a terrible thing. "
11320,Leicester City,Nope. If a replacement was lined up it would have been leaked weeks ago. Like Amorim with United. This news didn’t leak? Not even that weirdo on Twitter had it before the club.
11321,Leicester City,"Reasonable take as always Camel. I’ve also always been of the camp of he seems like a good bloke and all that, but the football was declining week in week out. 

Seeing Vardy have a go at him after he came off yesterday I thought something was falling apart within too. 

Like you said, glad we’ve just shown some bottle and bit the bullet, need to back whoever comes in now. And now the next question becomes who does everyone think will come in? I'll say I don't think this will happen, but if I'm dreaming Graham Potter. "
11322,Leicester City,"Did he really talk a good game? He mostly spent his time whining about refereeing decisions (to the point that he had more yellow cards than wins in all competitions while in charge of us). He spoke like a fan on a matchday, and while i get why that might be endearing, it shows him to be a rank fucking amateur as a manager. "
11323,Leicester City,https://preview.redd.it/r7ge4dr7jv2e1.jpeg?width=306&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eabdc4343d74974681139b361adbbdce5314e463 
11324,Leicester City,Please no. That man's personality and ego has eventually kicked his ass everywhere he's been.  Yeah but it would be fun
11325,Leicester City,"Better to back a new manager that’s more ambitious with the January window than the constant negativity and fan revolts imo. Well whoever we end up with, I hope they’re given some good backing in January because we definitely need it"
11326,Leicester City,"Who should it have been? All the managers that we couldn’t afford, and all those who didn’t want us?! Not sure tbh. Would’ve taken Moyes over him without a doubt. 

Anyone but cooper honestly. Poor manager who was a forest man at heart. Same thing as when Everton signed Rafa Benitez, was destined for failure. Makes no sense to bring in a manager that is already widely disliked by fans before a ball is kicked."
11327,Leicester City,"You wanted him sacked before he managed a match?

At the end of the day, hes left us above relegation (just) any half decent manager should keep us up with ease. 

Would be a different story if we were like 6 points off safety 3rd of September is when we found out there would be no deduction. In my opinion Cooper was a signing with Championship and deductions in mind. The minute we found out there wouldn’t be one that should’ve been the green light to get rid because the season objectives changed. I was a big fan of the signing when it was made for that very reason but watching him unable to pick a consistent team, have zero desire to win football matches and attack teams ultimately made me question him. The last straw was the signings as well as isolating our best players with no play time or erratic selections. So no. I was a supporter of the appointment at first."
11328,Leicester City,"I bloody hope so, but I won’t be getting my hopes up. 

As you say it’s not really surprising and I feel the club has done this as they have to be seen to be something different from our relegation. 

However just like Rogers there seems no immediate contingency "
11329,Leicester City,Lets not get so ahead of ourselves until we see who the new manager is and until we see if they can actually get results It can't possibly be someone worse than him.
11330,Leicester City,"At the end of the day you were above relegation which is the only objective this season 

Everyone who wants Moyes clearly doesn’t remember how offensively poor he was and potter isn’t the man to keep a relegation team up 

Everyone else either won’t come to Leicester or Leicester can’t afford to employ them Bored of this argument - yes we're above the relegation zone for now, but that counts for nothing. Anyone who watches us every week (which obviously isn't you) can see that we're destined to end up there based on our awful management and other teams such as Wolves and Ipswich starting to pick up points.

Also, I wish people would stop only mentioning Moyes and Potter as if they're the only 2 other managers in the world."
11331,Leicester City,"My take is we better effing win the league now with how everyone bitched and blamed all of our problems on him So what, you'd have kept him? Let his incompetence get us to the point where we can't escape before sacking him?"
11332,Leicester City,"We had a chance anyway. Judging by our recent performances, we absolutely did not"
11333,Leicester City,"We have 2 wins in 12 and one of them came from a miraculous last minute winner against a horrible Saints side from Ayew. We’d have lost to Ipswich as well if it wasn’t for another very late equalizer from him.

I wouldn’t call that getting results. [deleted]"
11334,Leicester City,Van nistletoy is favorite followed by Potter according to bookmakers We’ve tried Potter so many times and he’s said no… I really don’t want him here if he doesn’t seem to want the job. Ruud would be my first choice no matter who the options were.
11335,Leicester City,It was so obviously a mistake three weeks into the season there was no reason to deny it.  Better late than never I guess. 
11336,Leicester City,"Ugh… the last thing our team, a team in turmoil, needs is Jose showing up and making it all about him. Agreed it would be a huge mistake"
11337,Leicester City,Hopefully they have been working behind the scenes in preparation.  But in reality I doubt it. 
11338,Leicester City,He wasn't exactly sacked to early base upon performance.  After the second pre-season game might have been quickly  Any time after that would have been justified  Whilst I wouldn't go that far I certainly agree with the sentiment😂. My point was that I can't believe that the board have had the balls to go through with it
11339,Leicester City,We would have been had Palace got a result (which they weren’t far off) and Ipswich today. 
11340,Leicester City,Dear lord 
11341,Leicester City,This hiring proves it's far more important you analyze their skills as a coach rather than their past experience. That's why I'm asking. Van Nistelroy? He's like Rooney Great player. Enthusiasm. Just don't see him as more than a coach...when we need a manager. Ex players don't always make good managers. I know nothing but just wondering what it takes to look at successful lower level talent to bring the m up.
11342,Leicester City,"I actually think it will .no one was going to fight for cooper. If we go down fighting in the next 28 matches I'll suck it up. Cooper just doesn't instill ""Fixes never quit"" I don't think that's a great critique of SC tbh. If anything, passion was the only thing SC brought to the team given his apparent lack of any tactical intelligence. The comebacks early in the season were really great to watch and it really seemed like he got the team fighting for the shirt in a way Brendan, Smith, or Enzo never really did"
11343,Leicester City,Why are you here? ?
11344,Leicester City,"I think in normal circumstances he wouldn’t have been sacked. But with how negative the tactics were I think that just tipped it over the edge. If we had had a go against Chelsea or at least looked like an organised system I don’t think he would have been sacked. Agreed… we just didn’t look like we had a game plan in place for that game yesterday. Surprised to see him sacked but glad we didn’t drag it out. The HOPE is that the pulled the trigger because maybe they’ve got someone sniffing at the job. 

My hope would be Ruud… but more likely Moyes and while it’s not my ideal selection, I think I’d be ok with him to keep us up. I really just don’t want Jose. That would bring so much toxicity to the team."
11345,Leicester City,Not Ipswich. Just watched them manhandle MU. They're coming for us. There’s nothing that instills fear like the Ipswich side. Not to be met on a dark night in an alley that’s for sure.  Just a visual observation. Those guys are tough.
11346,Leicester City,"Agreed. The performances up the last 3 fixtures, two of which were against a resurgent United & then Chelsea have all had some positives. If you look at where we are in the league that’s probably  exactly where you’d have predicted us at the start of the season.

11347,Leicester City,I'm so sick of this bullshit. 
11348,Ipswich Town,"Getting really tired of the camera cutting to him after every Ipswich goal. 

Seems like a sound bloke, but I think he needs to ask Sky and BT to relax on coverage of him, which I don't will happen. I think they have the same issue in the NFL with the way the TV stations are obsessed with Taylor swift supporting her boyfriend. I suspect it’s also the same for Wrexham fans."
11349,Ipswich Town,"I’d actually like to see him pay more attention to the ladies team considering he’s their sponsor as well and the girls are absolutely killing it this season, Ladies team is on fire!"
11350,Ipswich Town,"I don't really mind it, he's pretty harmless and giving our club good publicity. Interviews getting gatecrashed is nothing new, often when it happens people find it amusing. Only difference yesterday is hoards of Utd fans who need somewhere to direct their anger because their team is shite. Otherwise I doubt anyone would care much. "
11351,Ipswich Town,"Tbh, I think it's on the sky producers as well. Should have told him to do one as it was pretty unprofessional from everyone all round to interrupt and interview. Amorim should quite rightly be annoyed. "
11352,Ipswich Town,I thought the sky interruption was weird - surely he would have seen that they were live and interviewing the Man Utd boss? 
11353,Ipswich Town,"I think the comment about getting more publicity for the women’s team is a great shout! Some of their recent goals have been 🤌 Can I just say, as a female town fan, with a football playing daughter it utterly warms my heart to see so many people on this post agree with my initial post about more support for ITFC ladies. 

There is still a long way to go in terms of exposure of the woman’s game, and so many people (mainly men, but not limited to), who are so scathing, and even resentful, of any publicity surrounding the women’s game. To see so many of you here straight away saying “absolutely, let’s do it” is really really positive and it reminds me why I’m proud to be a town fan. 

For my daughter, who knows no different, it really makes such a a difference to know that football is for everyone."
11354,Ipswich Town,"Honestly, show him all you want. While he wasn’t the primary driver of the team’s success, it sure didn’t hurt having him in the corner. I’ll personally be rather sad when the kits are advertising for some oil or media company next year, instead of the guy who put his heart and his own money into the team.  

Nothing but love to Sheeran and what he’s done in exposing the team to more fans. Word. I really like having his brand on the shirt for all kinds of reasons"
11355,Ipswich Town,"I don’t listen to his music but he seems like a top bloke who loves ITFC like the rest of us. He’s helping to put us on the map waaaaay beyond where it really belongs and perhaps helping with the crap/ parochial reputation our little club had previously. Everyone outside of Suffolk thought we were just carrot-crunching minnows but he adds serious gravitas to our county, town and club. It’s no different to Elton-Watford or Gallaghers-Man City, or even those cross-eyed hillbilly bros at Wrexham. What’s not to love? Don’t be such a killjoy! "
11356,Ipswich Town,"I want to see the ladies team more on Town Tv, Absolutely,"
11357,Ipswich Town,"I'm a US fan and from a marketing perspective I think it helps. A number of women I know refer to the club as his team, thinking he owns the whole thing. If it sells a few more shirts and gets us some more broadcast revenue it can only be a good thing. "
11358,Ipswich Town,I believe he is technically a part owner now. I think he provides loads more benefit to the club (and town) than worrying about a slightly embarrassing drop in on a Sky Sports post match interview. 
11359,Ipswich Town,"I don’t know why people are getting so annoyed about him slightly interrupting an interview. Like yea it’s sorta cringe but that’s it idk. People making a big deal out of nothing like it isn’t just the most whatever inconvenience ever. Oh no someone was a bit too enthusiastic and interrupted. 

Like just move on? I can’t imagine anyone else is giving it much thought who was actually there. These things happen. I don’t think it’s gonna be a “final straw” like what he has a mural and is the sponsor who will eventually be replaced? I don’t think about him at all during games and the most you get is the commentary pointing out he’s here and then never mention him again lmao It honestly wasn’t that big of a deal, he was there like 20 seconds at most. I can’t believe so many got in their feelings about it, it’s not that deep."
11360,Ipswich Town,"I hate to say this but football IS a business these days and with one of the biggest stars in the planet being an Ipswich fan brings revenue and publicity to our club. 
I personally don’t really like his music, but his brand is a godsend to Town, how many shirt sales will there be next year when he’s not sponsoring the shirt? "
11361,Ipswich Town,"I have to say I think the mural is going a step too far. The partnership with Sheeran and also the promo stuff with Fabio Wardley of course make a lot of sense, but on both counts appear to have been milked beyond the point of sensibility and into the realm of mildly irritating… "
11362,Ipswich Town,"You're not understanding how the media etc work.

The Sky interview he apologised for and was arguably Sky's fault.

Other than that what's he guilty of? Coming to games?

It's all media stuff. "
11363,Ipswich Town,Then complain to the reporters and news outlets who are making the headlines for clicks 
11364,Ipswich Town,"I thought giving him a squad number and a promotion medal was a bit weird. But it's brought attention to the club, so why not?
However, the sky stuff is completely fine with me, not like he's a slimey owner type like both manchester clubs. He's seems to he having fun at every match.
Who cares if he interrupted amorim, the bloke seems sour already like he's final season klopp. It's not like you learn anything from the pundits on sky anyways. If it's a draw at half time they just tell everyone that team A needs to move the ball a bit faster.
Also who were those pundits anyways. What does jamie redknapp or some city striker have to do with ipswich or united? Were Darren bent or Luke chambers occupied doing something else? I severly doubt it. They were there for both SUPER SUNDAY games. So Jamie Redknapp makes sense, having played for both Southampton and Liverpool. Roy Keane made sense, having played for United and managed Town. And the woman made sense because God forbid not having a woman on the panel these days. You sound fun at parties"
11365,Ipswich Town,Can’t find the video 
11366,Ipswich Town,"I think what you’re forgetting is that he is the team sponsor. He is paying to have his name/business more visible, that’s the exchange for the money. So is he on screen a lot for a celeb, yes. Is it exactly what he paid for, yes. 

I second wanting to see him apart of the women’s team more. I know next year he won’t be the sponsor so maybe he’ll put alittle money into their side to pump things up. But unlike most sponsorships where the sponsor pays to gain publicity in this case he is paying for publicity he really doesn’t need or particularly want. He’s doing it for love of the club. 

He said he first did it because he didn’t like us having a gambling sponsor and figured he was in a position to do something about it, which is sound by me."
11367,Ipswich Town,"Don't turn on your own, Judas! "
11368,Ipswich Town,You do not realise how lucky you are to have someone in that position that quite obviously cares deeply about your club. 
11369,Ipswich Town,"Imagine this being a complaint about our club 6-7 years ago 😂 At the end of the day he’s friggin Ed Sheeran, it’s not like he’s cynically latched on for exposure. He clearly cares and if it is in fact true that he sponsored us because he didn’t want a betting sponsor on the shirt he can keep showing up as long as he likes imo. "
11370,Ipswich Town,"He seems a good lad who is self aware, wouldn’t surprise me if he backs away a bit out of the limelight at games by his own accord "
11371,Ipswich Town,"I would have expected Sky or the grounds staff to have had a soft perimeter to the interview environment. Unless it was choreographed. It's a tricky balance with celebs like Sheeran - how do you keep being a ""normal bloke"" and yet are seen have insider status? A misstep can can be a bit damaging. Luckily he caught this one. "
11372,Ipswich Town,"He's the famous fan and sky et Al are trying to have showbiz moments. I don't think he should be welcomed to just walk over during a broadcast like he did with Amorim the other day, but PL fans will only have 6 more months of this for a few years I reckon. "
11373,Ipswich Town,"As an Everton fan, I’ve no skin in this game but I think having an Ed Sheeran backing the club he loves is no bad thing. We had Sylvester Stallone drop in to Goodison around 2008 and then he seemed to lose interest or see sense depending on your point of view. At least there’s an authentic thing going on with Ed. But agree, the photobomb moment was cringe. Amorim pleading for time in front of Keane who was straining to be nice and Redknapp stepping in to explain to an over excited Ed that the grown ups were talking….he’ll write a song about it one day and everything will be fine.  Good luck to Town and much respect to the fans, Kieran and Ed for what seems from the outside to be a club pulling in a good direction….very envious. 👍🏻👍🏻 "
11374,Ipswich Town,"Sport in general now seems to be leaning on non-that-sport celebrities.


It annoys me. "
11375,Ipswich Town,I hear you. He was all over it at the start of the season when it should have been about McKenna & Morsy’s men and 22 years away. Then the next peep we hear from him is after the first win at Tottenham and how he played his part… yesterday was just crass. We have our Delia 
11376,Ipswich Town,"He’s famous what do you expect, chill out and watch the football "
11377,Ipswich Town,I think they have the same issue in the NFL with the way the TV stations are obsessed with Taylor swift supporting her boyfriend. I suspect it’s also the same for Wrexham fans. 
11378,Ipswich Town,"Ladies team is on fire! I genuinely think they’ll go up this season. We went quite a few times last year (my 9yo daughter loves them) and the investment into the team is showing what’s possible. I do think they’ve outgrown the goldstar stadium though. 

I like the way that Ashton has been clear about pushing the ladies team - there’s plenty of merch in the club shop, the opportunities to play at PR etc. there’s plenty of money to be made, and right now the opportunities are endless. Arsenal Ladies have shown what can be possible when you put equal investment and emphasis into both teams, it’s genuinely exciting to see what could be possible. And locally, the grassroots girls football scene is absolutely thriving which is fantastic to see, Nobody cares 🤡"

For my daughter, who knows no different, it really makes such a a difference to know that football is for everyone. I'm a Town season ticket holder, living near Bristol. My wife has got used to me being away most Saturdays following Town home and away.

She has started following the women's team, so much so that we got tickets for the recent game in Newport (that was unfortunately postponed).
The fact that they are getting plenty of coverage on the club's social media makes it so much easier. I'm delighted that she has started following the club I have loved fo 50 years. 

There can never be a negative about promoting the women's game."

I like the way that Ashton has been clear about pushing the ladies team - there’s plenty of merch in the club shop, the opportunities to play at PR etc. there’s plenty of money to be made, and right now the opportunities are endless. Arsenal Ladies have shown what can be possible when you put equal investment and emphasis into both teams, it’s genuinely exciting to see what could be possible. And locally, the grassroots girls football scene is absolutely thriving which is fantastic to see, "
11387,Ipswich Town,Nobody cares 🤡 At least 2 people do… and my mom says I’m somebody. ☺️
11388,Ipswich Town,"I'm a Town season ticket holder, living near Bristol. My wife has got used to me being away most Saturdays following Town home and away.

She has started following the women's team, so much so that we got tickets for the recent game in Newport (that was unfortunately postponed).
The fact that they are getting plenty of coverage on the club's social media makes it so much easier. I'm delighted that she has started following the club I have loved fo 50 years. 

There can never be a negative about promoting the women's game. "
11389,Ipswich Town,And you do? 
11390,Ipswich Town,At least 2 people do… and my mom says I’m somebody. ☺️ 
11391,Ipswich Town,Hilarious. “You ginger twat”🤣 🤣 That’s suffolk for ya💪🏼😂
11392,Ipswich Town,The best part about our squad is the lack of arrogance. Selfish players ruin a team but this squad only cares about results. Arrogant clubs make arrogant fans. And arrogant fans end up embarassing themselves and the club. Glad we seem relatively level-headed for the most part. It’s not like Man Utd have had anything to be arrogant about in recent years? How old is this kid?
11393,Ipswich Town,Lovely. I hate arrogant people. I hate mancs. Well played Sammie This guys an act though I’m far too simple
11394,Ipswich Town,"That’s hilarious! 

This lad seemed utterly surprised that he got that reply. What did he think was going to happen? That Man U would win? - lol he’s gonna be bald before that happens"
11395,Ipswich Town,"Hilarious that mancs still think they're something special. Yesterday was 2 points dropped, utd are no better than us. "
11396,Ipswich Town,EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!! 
11397,Ipswich Town,Circle Jerked!!! 
11398,Ipswich Town,"Taken down? 

Utter cringe "
11399,Ipswich Town,🤣 
11400,Ipswich Town,That’s suffolk for ya💪🏼😂 
11401,Ipswich Town,"It’s not like Man Utd have had anything to be arrogant about in recent years? How old is this kid? Gotta be in his 20s. He should know that theyve been shit for years but treats them like title contenders. The one thing I hoped we'd do this season is stick it to the big teams and after games like Spurs, Villa and United I couldnt be happier."
11402,Ipswich Town,This guys an act though

The thing that I love about football is that there is never a guarantee about anything. The fact that our last game saw us beat Spurs and the number of draws we’ve had should have alerted him to the fact that we might be in the relegation zone but actually we’re not that easy to beat."

Watching this lad in the video and all the other knobheads on social media get humbled brings me joy. We're not as bad as they think we are and tbh its just nice to be spoken about in a positive light after taking points off a big club.

11408,Ipswich Town,"You know he’s just joking and it’s for entertainment right? I suppose so, but for me a joke is supposed to be between fans. Not messaging a player just to tell him his teams shit."
11409,Ipswich Town,"I suppose so, but for me a joke is supposed to be between fans. Not messaging a player just to tell him his teams shit. "
11410,Ipswich Town,🎶 I WANNA DANCE WITH OMARI 🎶 
11411,Ipswich Town,Absolute screamer 
11412,Ipswich Town,"Those fans were pollocks, no need for it. "
11413,Ipswich Town,"What a way to embarrass yourself in front of the world. At least the lads back in the pub will pipe you off about it, Keith "
11414,Ipswich Town,His arse fell out. 
11415,Ipswich Town,"Thought we played well, definitely the more threatening of the two teams. United have a lot of work to do. Very average indeed. 

Thought back four were excellent as well as Hutchinson and Delap. 

Another day we would have won 3-1 with Delap getting two tap ins. Delap just unlucky today. Excellent chances to no fault of his own."
11416,Ipswich Town,"Gotta be happy with the result, we could’ve easily netted 2 or 3 with the chances we had. The press worked great to keep us the ball, I think McKenna’s ideas are finally finding form and starting to gel with the lineup, a lot to be excited for - COYB Right, a bit of tactics change from McKenna and a bit of the players catching up physically. We are fun to watch Forsure."
11417,Ipswich Town,"This was a good showing! Better team outside of the first 90 seconds. 

Could Muric done better? Maybe, But he shouldn’t have been put in that position, I’m happy to put it down to getting caught cold. 

Other than that I thought it was all around a good showing where we could have been 2-1 or even 3-1.

Al-Hamadi cannot do it at this level though. He didn’t seem to really put much effort it and it seemed like offensive moves were all going around him rather than with him. I know Hirst is a quality back up, but given how often he is injured maybe we need to look for a third striker in January. They’ve said we are going to spend another  100 mill in Jan"
11418,Ipswich Town,"Far the better team, but we have to cut our the silly mistakes that cost us goals and at times points "
11419,Ipswich Town,"Really good performance, and on any other day we would have had a win , just bad luck in front of goal but a solid team performance, Delap and Hutchinson are looking better with each game and with Szmodics also on top form I really fancy us to score in every game. After Spurs And Man Utd we should take this confidence into the next few games . 
Muric is a great shot stopper and good in the air , great hands but scares the hell out of me with the Ball at his feet , I felt he should have been more aware and alert for the goal and it's something we still are learning at this level , if you give a team any space they will hurt you . "
11420,Ipswich Town,"Played them off the pitch in the first half, shame the second got so scrappy. Omari was the obvious standout, but I thought Cajuste had a really good game too.

I will continue to bang my anti-Muric drum, he didn't even attempt to go for the ball for the goal. Either he froze up or wasn't aware Rashford was there and both are unacceptable. Muric didn't do anything wrong in this game. Everyone has decided he's a liability so are looking for things to criticise him for. Another goal we conceded due to a player lunging in and missing it rather than just going with the man Muric couldn't have done anything for the goal. Rashford ran across him. It came from Cajuste sliding in on amad and then O'Shea losing his runner poor marking of rashford to be fair everyone knows what he’s capable of with his runs but town seem to ignore that but I would of thought Muric would of seen rashford running in the box but was to focused on the cross. But Muric can’t pass the ball to any town players well he really needs to work on that. He loses possession so easily then the other team attack is on. I personally think he was a poor signing but he has had a few good games and kept us in the games from time to time. But still a good result for us god Delap is a beast bullying them defenders gotta love him."
11421,Ipswich Town,"It’s a bittersweet feeling leaving Portman Road after playing Manchester United and be disappointed with a draw. I really like what is happening with the team lately hopefully players to come back from injury for extra depth and we start to have a real competitive looking squad. I agree with most we could’ve easily won 3-1 but 4 points from Spurs and United back to back you can’t argue with that one bit. 

I’m glad Omari shined today, he deserves the plaudits from the general football world he’s been that good most of the time but today was extra special. Onwards and upwards, first PR win is coming… "
11422,Ipswich Town,"Any town fan who is anti-Muric, or any of our players, can get in the bin. "
11423,Ipswich Town,"Good game, not a bad result...does anyone worry about when we're going to start turning these good performances into wins though?

Not being unrealistic and I'd be fine with us finishing 17th on GD...but this still means we can't be waiting another 10 games for the next win. "
11424,Ipswich Town,"Muric giveth and Muric taketh away He didn't do anything wrong in this game, the goal wasn't his fault"
11425,Ipswich Town,"neutral coming in peace. does anyone have a clip of when the Liverpool keeper clattered into the Ipswich forward? there's so much penalty chatter on the premier league sub over this game, I feel like that particular play needs to be discussed...

when I saw it, I thought it was a pen 1000% "
11426,Ipswich Town,"Delap just unlucky today. Excellent chances to no fault of his own. Absolutely. Unlucky albeit the first one, he really should score."
11427,Ipswich Town,"Right, a bit of tactics change from McKenna and a bit of the players catching up physically. We are fun to watch Forsure. "
11428,Ipswich Town,They’ve said we are going to spend another  100 mill in Jan 
11429,Ipswich Town,Muric didn't do anything wrong in this game. Everyone has decided he's a liability so are looking for things to criticise him for. Another goal we conceded due to a player lunging in and missing it rather than just going with the man Have you not seen his passing?
11430,Ipswich Town,Muric couldn't have done anything for the goal. Rashford ran across him. It came from Cajuste sliding in on amad and then O'Shea losing his runner I totally agree on this one. I may be disappointed but that one was going in regardless. We were overloaded.
11431,Ipswich Town,poor marking of rashford to be fair everyone knows what he’s capable of with his runs but town seem to ignore that but I would of thought Muric would of seen rashford running in the box but was to focused on the cross.

11433,Ipswich Town,"Absolutely. Unlucky albeit the first one, he really should score. "
11434,Ipswich Town,Have you not seen his passing? 
11435,Ipswich Town,I totally agree on this one. I may be disappointed but that one was going in regardless. We were overloaded. 
11436,Ipswich Town,I reckon Omari might get a goal today You called it!
11437,Ipswich Town,"Gotta say, that's not a particularly strong Man U side. Assuming Dalot is playing in the back three, Delap can run rings around both him and Evans, and Casemiro/Eriksen is hardly a solid midfield two...

Still prefer Omari on the right but I understand what Burns brings so I won't complain too much. "
11438,Ipswich Town,Could do without some of the injuries. Hopefully Hutchinson is fully fit and even more hopefully is that Burns actually turns up! 
11439,Ipswich Town,You called it! Massive deflection but I'll take it
11440,Ipswich Town,Massive deflection but I'll take it 
11441,Ipswich Town,"I love Omari so much, I feel like every game now he's receiving the ball on the halfway line with two defenders on his shoulders and somehow coming out with the ball anyway So impressive! Created a goal exactly like that against Spurs (from yet another Muric hospital pass)."
11442,Ipswich Town,Afternoon Ipswich…Toon fan in peace. Please smash manure the memes will be so good 
11443,Ipswich Town,"Did Muric fill his boots with concrete before he started, or is he blind in one eye and didn't see the onrushing striker He was unlucky and just a bit nieve.

For all Rashford's faults, his acceleration over those distances can catch the best keepers out."
11444,Ipswich Town,What in fucks name is Muric doing there? That’s basically been his best all year
11445,Ipswich Town,Shocking keeper 
11446,Ipswich Town,"Had a hunch on omari, said he would score - see the team sheet post hahahahah "
11447,Ipswich Town,"Love the tactics, the press is working and we’re seeing a lot of the ball - in boss McKenna we trust "
11448,Ipswich Town,"We have been so flat the 2nd half. I have a bad feeling about this. Cmon lads, let’s finish strong!! "
11449,Ipswich Town,"Shame about the early goal as we’re playing well… Omari has been brilliant in particular.

With a different goalkeeper, I believe we’d be mid table. "
11450,Ipswich Town,What's the best CB pairing? Burgess is solid 
11451,Ipswich Town,Hell yeah Omari 
11452,Ipswich Town,Decent from town. Looks comfortable in possession and creating chances. Just wish Burns had more confidence to beat his man although he has put a few decent balls in I think this is actually his best game so far.
11453,Ipswich Town,Great performance and could have won it. 
11454,Ipswich Town,So impressive! Created a goal exactly like that against Spurs (from yet another Muric hospital pass). 
11455,Ipswich Town,"He was unlucky and just a bit nieve.

For all Rashford's faults, his acceleration over those distances can catch the best keepers out. "
11456,Ipswich Town,That’s basically been his best all year 
11457,Ipswich Town,I think this is actually his best game so far. I actually agree with that 100% but he is playing a different game in my opinion. He isn’t beating his man but he did put some good crosses in today and defended better.
11458,Ipswich Town,I actually agree with that 100% but he is playing a different game in my opinion. He isn’t beating his man but he did put some good crosses in today and defended better. 
11459,Ipswich Town,"Yeah, I'd take a draw "
11460,Ipswich Town,"Can see united scoring, so maybe 6-2 is more realistic? "
11461,Ipswich Town,"We did beat the team who just beat Man City (at home) 4-0, 2-1 (away) so anything can happen. I’d definitely fancy our chances against City ATM"
11462,Ipswich Town,I would genuinely be confident about picking up a victory against them if Ten Hag was still in charge. I now have absolutely no idea what to expect. 
11463,Ipswich Town,I believe 
11464,Ipswich Town,Yeah I’d take a win 
11465,Ipswich Town,"I think Town can pull off a win, not sure the ManU players will be ready to pull off Amorim’s system of play. 

Have a watch of this, I don’t know enough about football to know how McKenna works against this… https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCtWJbDOAMi/?igsh=c3N6bjZzd3V6ZmV6 "
11466,Ipswich Town,I’d definitely fancy our chances against City ATM 
11467,Ipswich Town,Enjoy the game ! COYB 
11468,Ipswich Town,We designated our own bar in NYC. See if you can get enough fans together and start one in Boston! It’s been a blast so far. Plenty of Town fans in Lincolnshire!

11472,Ipswich Town,"I’m quite certain he mean Boston in New York City OK that's the Boston with the cowboy hats and steers, got it. Boston in New York City? What? They’re two completely different cities over 200 miles apart?"

11497,Ipswich Town,"***The Telegraph reports***:

As the pressure grew on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Manchester United in the autumn of 2021, the club made him an offer. They believed there was a lack of experience on the manager’s coaching staff and he needed help. They wanted to bring in someone new.

Solskjaer responded by telling United’s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, that he regarded his coaches as “world-class” and he did not need anyone else.

So, United backed off. There was even talk of those coaches being offered new contracts, following on from the one awarded to the manager that summer and, later, his assistant, Mike Phelan, which again pointed to the lack of joined-up thinking. Within weeks, Solskjaer was sacked and the attention focused even more on his staff and the roles they had played.

Chief among them was Kieran McKenna and, less so, former United midfielder Michael Carrick. Both were first-team coaches. At the time, sources told *Telegraph Sport* that McKenna, then just 35, appeared out of his depth, that he lacked charisma and that he acted like a schoolteacher; that the training sessions he put on were more suited to the academy football from where he had been promoted and lacked intensity. And that this had contributed to United’s problems.

The criticism was withering, portraying McKenna as a clipboard coach and that while he clearly knew what he was doing, and put a significant amount of work into it, his relative lack of experience meant he was not always fully listened to and he could not quite push the players hard enough.

How wrong it was. Three years later, McKenna will be in Ipswich Town’s dugout at Portman Road, having earnt extraordinary back-to-back promotions, facing Ruben Amorim in the Premier League in what will be the Portuguese’s first game in charge.

Such has been his impressive progress that it could even have been McKenna as United’s head coach. Not this time around, when Erik ten Hag was finally sacked, but at the end of last season when he was on the list worked through by United and Ineos as they carried out their review as to whether Ten Hag should continue.

No one denies there was interest in McKenna and there were talks with his representatives before the FA Cup final win that ultimately helped earn Ten Hag a reprieve. However, it certainly did not go as far as the more detailed discussions with Roberto De Zerbi and, in particular, Thomas Tuchel.

**Full story:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/22/ipswich-kieran-mckenna-man-utd-manager-solskjaer/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/22/ipswich-kieran-mckenna-man-utd-manager-solskjaer/) ""brutal"" swear this guy survived for like 3 different managers Ignoring if it was brutal or not, it does not surprise me that McKenna's perceived ""clipboard coach"" would work at Town and not United. 

At Town, he has a squad willing to run through walls for him and do everything he asks whereas the United squad takes a lot more convincing and has more ""divas"" if you will. The problem is media like to make false contrasts. And retrospectively claim insight. 

Coaching is teaching and management. Both of those are equally craft and science. You can only learn in the job, and it involves failing. In all cases a central role in a high profile commercial enterprise is RARELY the place to take your first steps. 

I remember in university I had a professor who was new from PhD, first job - taking class with this person was horrible and many of us just skipped class. That’s how painful and dreary it was. Second year in the job, huge improvements. A couple years later, this professor was winning teaching awards. 

So it’s nothing new. Indeed he failed. And no Man Utd could really keep him - the institution is not a place for learning on the job. But if he was smart enough to be there, it was  always Lille he was intelligent and adaptable to regroup and come back later - although no way in hell Man Utd would be able to still be his learning place.  

Telegraph has no news here. It’s completely likely outcome. "
11498,Ipswich Town,Paywall? 
11499,Ipswich Town,"I wish I was treated brutally by getting paid 1+ million pounds a year and getting adored by millions of fans. 

Every United fan loves ole and his crew. He didn’t have a decent squad which is unfortunate. "
11500,Ipswich Town,"I don’t know how the club teated him and that will probably never come out but I don’t think Ed Woodward treated him or Ole any better than how he treated likes of Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra. 

As for the fans, we never treated him brutally. Sure you have trolls and ‘tacticos’ who think they know everything but regular fans teated Ole, Carrick and him very well and were very supportive. "
11501,Ipswich Town,"He's not an elite manager, let's be honest. 

Ridiculous label. "
11502,Ipswich Town,"""brutal"" swear this guy survived for like 3 different managers "
11503,Ipswich Town,"Ignoring if it was brutal or not, it does not surprise me that McKenna's perceived ""clipboard coach"" would work at Town and not United. 

At Town, he has a squad willing to run through walls for him and do everything he asks whereas the United squad takes a lot more convincing and has more ""divas"" if you will. This was 100% the issue at United. He came to us from Spurs as one of the most promising coaches in English football, our youth teams played fantastic football under him and he was highly rated by everyone he worked with. Yet the players didn’t respect him as he didn’t have the playing career behind him / he was a very young coach. 

A lot of (online, I.e. the most vocal and idiotic group around) United fans started blaming McKenna and Carrick (as Ole’s style of management was very much old school in letting the coaches run the sessions) yet as soon as they both left they’ve been very good (Carrick) and exceptional (McKenna). 100% was the players at United (as well as the absolute state of the clubs) rather than him. And most crucially it’s a squad on relatively low inequality in wages, so all with big incentives. 

I contrast a Man Utd manager is dealing with players on 5-7 year contracts who earn more than him. They can actually ignore him andwait him out. 

It’s not a coincidence that Ten Haag was desperately seeking young up and comers like Mainoo, Garnacho and Diallo,who were talented enough to pay at the highest level, but hungry to learn and hungry to play for bigger contracts. "

It’s not a coincidence that Ten Haag was desperately seeking young up and comers like Mainoo, Garnacho and Diallo,who were talented enough to pay at the highest level, but hungry to learn and hungry to play for bigger contracts.  "

Before Ipswich or Leicester do Leicester can’t as they already have Buanotte on loan, and he wouldn’t go to play second fiddle to Delap"
11578,Southampton,"Honestly, I think he'd be massive. Having a genuine threat up top - even it it's just threatening by his name alone - might give a bit of a confidence boost.

A loan for him is such a low risk, high reward opportunity in my books. Sport Republic are too smart to make the obvious moves. We'll sign a league 1 level striker from the Moroccan league for twice what they're worth."
11579,Southampton,"Isn't there a limit on PL club loans from other PL clubs that we've already hit? If not then this would be great Maybe we could release cornet, since he's done literally nothing "
11580,Southampton,"Brighton fan. 

Please take him. He needs to be playing football.

He doesn’t do a lot for the team off the ball and can drift out of games for long periods. 

Give him service and he will score goals That last point is where it all falls down!"
11581,Southampton,"I feel like we'd not get him in (or any other ""proven"" striker) without offloading at least some of our many dud/unused players.

Then again, I'm not sure who/what we'll try to get in January. "

11591,Southampton,Love the “is this the moon guy??” comments 
11592,Southampton,"It’s the fact that he was successful last season (achieving promotion) but failing direly this season. I don’t think any of our other managers have had such a difference in performance in recent times (of course none of our other recent managers have managed in two different leagues since Adkins). Maybe it's just a preference thing for me but I wasn't particularly impressed by him in the championship either. 



Can't argue with getting promoted, he's done what is asked if him but I have a hard time telling if he got the best out of a borderline promotion team, or if he made hard work out of it with one of the better teams in the division. I don’t know if I feel he was that successful last season to be honest, given the resources he had I think a better way to put it is he achieved the bare minimum expected of him. 

I think the main problem is that those defending Russel have not actually pointed to anything concrete as to why he should keep his job yet, it’s all excuses, and pointing out that we should expect to go down. 

Why? We stabilised in the league last time around, and with less budget. The failures for me this season lie with both Martin and SR - and it’s not like they didn’t have plenty of time to plan and prepare. Neither have."
11593,Southampton,"My own opinion is polarised, so you can understand why the fanbase is. I'm not too bothered about a manager sticking to 'his way'. He has tried to assemble a squad to do certain things, so you have to play that way really. I was impressed with the more pragmatic approach against Liverpool, and it shows he can do things differently. What I don't like is his in-game management. His changes against Leicester lost us that game without a doubt, and that for me was borderline unforgiveable as that was a must win. 

I felt very ""Martin Out"" after that Leicester game, but i'm not 100% sure I am anymore, given what it would cost that club, and how far adrift we are already (not just taking points into consideration, but what the clubs around us are starting to do). Is it worth splashing loads of cash to realistically give us an (not guaranteed) ever so slightly better chance of staying up? Or do we stick with Martin long term, go down, and hope we get back again and some of the better players stick around? The referee lost us the Leicester game, no doubt about it."
11594,Southampton,"I recall pretty split opinion on Claude Puel. We were having an okay season. Mid table. Cup run. But the football was drab. Lots in the ""We can do better. Squad is better than this, Puel Out"".

Then, there were others who were happy with the performance and results and were less critical.

Puel suffered coming straight after Poch and Koeman who gave us our best football in recent history. And expectations were high.

Hassenhuttl to an extent too in his later season(s) with us. Puel is definitely the one that comes to mind. We were 8th and reached a cup final for goodness sake. I don't get how you can look at that with a worse squad and think ""sack.""

It's even worse with hindsight. Next season, we had Pellegrino who took us into a relegation fight needing a Gabbiadini goal vs Swansea to not get relegated. And we haven't really recovered from that despite Hassenhuttl's best efforts. Ah yes you’re quite right"
11595,Southampton,"For me I’ve just never loved or been converted to his football. 
I didn’t like it last season even though we got promoted and it’s being even more exposed this season. 
I don’t want to watch 500 passes a game and maybe two chances created. It’s boring. 
Also when there is no intensity it’s a complete chore to watch. 
I know a fair few people who have this opinion. 
I’ll be glad when he’s left personally. In his interview post Wolves, he said as much himself, which is why I'm hoping that game was a watershed moment. We played much differently against Liverpool and looked much better for it, so hopefully that continues."
11596,Southampton,"The toxic nature of football fandom. I don’t hate Martin, he actually seems like a very decent, compassionate and empathetic person.

As a manger though, I don’t think he’s right for us at this time. Or, for the goals of becoming a stable PL club, was ever really the right fit. "
11597,Southampton,"I think he does so much for the community, is a great ambassador and reminds me of Ralph a lot - just a bit more 'Landan'.

I totally get anger towards the way the team is playing and us getting so close to securing good results only to inevitably fuck it up in the last 20 mins of games or with comical errors (handball, wayward goalkeeping etc.). We all want Saints to do well, we just have different ideas on how to achieve that. We've all seen shit managerial appointments over the decades (Redknapp, Jones, Pellegrino) I'd just rather we avoided spinning the dice on that again.

Is Martins perfect? Absolutely not, but he got us here - he deserves a shot and it is still so tight at the bottom. If we play the way we did Sunday against teams in and around us, we will pick up points. The reaction to Sunday in some quarters was legit insane. As a coach you cannot legislate for your backup keeper making a cock-up! Take out individual mistakes and Martin has basically out-tacticked the league leaders. A Scouse red I know said to me afterwards “No one has opened us up like that this season”. But you go online and it’s “THIS MAN IS DESTROYING OUR CLUB”."
11598,Southampton,"There are definitely some weirdos out there who are like that and need to calm down. Though I think the discussion for the reasonable ones is that if we don't try something different, we'll stay 20th. 

As much as Russell is a good guy, the squad isn't that good (especially with Ramsdale out) and he's not good enough to get more than 20th with it. For survival in the Premier League, we need something else. "
11599,Southampton,It’s just people being entitled arseholes. They have their opinion and everyone else must have the same or they have a tantrum. Pot kettle black
11600,Southampton,"I don't think he's polarising at all. Most fans dislike him. 

If he seems polarising, it's probably becaues the hate towards him is more intense. I don't see the love for him being more intense than any other manager. 

The hate towards him is more intense because Saints are getting worse results than they ever have before. It's quite self explainatory. 

The only real argument anyone has to keep him is ""we couldn't attract anyone better"". Nobody argues for his positive qualities that they want to keep. 

Other managers like Nathan Jones and Harry Redknapp were more hated. Saints fans have some goodwill towards Martin due to promotion, whereas fans had no feeling of gratitude or debt to the other hated managers, so I guess that makes the feeling towards Martin more polarised than them. Redknapp was the worst. He went on national tv saying there was nothing he could do with the bunch of players he had, and they weren't good enough to stay up.

All he had to do was find a half decent centre back and keep his mouth shut. The clown got relegated with Crouch and Phillips up front. I’ll argue for his positive qualities all day.

He’s tactically excellent, an excellent coach, an excellent man-manager and a decent human being. If we get the pen we should get at 2-1 we’re probably 3-1 up against the league leaders, with Tall Paul and Wee Man in our starting XI. God love em they’re noy PL players. I’m sorry but you have to be blinded by hatred to not give credit for that.

I say this as someone who’s gone all the way up to UEFA B as a coach. I don't personally believe that most fans hate him. I think you see a lot of that online, but people online generally skew negative. When I talk to people at games I get the feeling personally that most fans still don't really know what to make of him."
11601,Southampton,"I think the reason it's polarising is from the trauma of what has happened post Ralph. For the last 10+ years, or at least in leibherr era our replacements have always been alright. From pardew to adkins to poch to koeman to puel (who again polarised) to a bit of a wobble to Ralph. 

So when people wanted change, it was nearly always a net positive result until we went to jones and selles. When you see the polarised arguments online it's always ""who out there is better?"" Because we have no confidence that the board will get in someone better. In my opinion we shouldn't have gotten him in the first place, knowing that possession based football doesn't work in the prem outside of the elite, and now he's been here too long after seeing Burnley fail miserably last season. I will say, the whole credit in the bank thing is not something I give credence to considering he did the bare minimum last year and was 0/4 against the other teams that came up.

TL;DR - nobody has any faith the board will replace him adequately and so the devil you know is better than the devil you don't. "
11602,Southampton,"I mean 4 points all season and the manager hasn't been sacked it's going to cause a rift in the fan base. For me personally I find RM style of football to be extremely frustrating to watch. 

The constant passing out from the back is suicidal at times and causes us a lot of problems. Also we get into good attacking positions and then instead of taking a player on or putting a cross into the box we pass it all the way backwards into our own half. 

He could potentially be a good manager at a better club with better players but it's clearly not working for us this season and I don't understand why the board haven't made a change yet. "
11603,Southampton,"Burley was shocking but he got us to the playoffs and then got the Scotland job so I must have seen things differently to at least a few people!

IIRC, there was quite a bit of debate about whether Ralph had ""given up"" and also when Pardew got the heave-ho, some people questioned whether ...how should I put it....""backroom antics"" should mean the end of a good football manager. "
11604,Southampton,"I think a large part of it is people disagreeing about how strong our squad is. Some people think our squad is stronger than it’s performance and some think it’s weaker. Imo we are the weakest squad in the prem and we were a weaker squad than leeds last season so I credit rm for getting us up, but a lot of people think our squad was good enough for autos. "
11605,Southampton,"Ignore them. Contrarian people with ridiculous opinions have always existed, they just used to be confined to the quiet corner of the pub. Social media now means that we all see it but it doesn't make it any more useful. This is probably very sensible, but another reply suggests these people think they’re the majority!"
11606,Southampton,"Maybe it's just a preference thing for me but I wasn't particularly impressed by him in the championship either. 



Can't argue with getting promoted, he's done what is asked if him but I have a hard time telling if he got the best out of a borderline promotion team, or if he made hard work out of it with one of the better teams in the division. The latter. I firmly believe we gained promotion through squad quality alone. We succeeded in spite of Martin not because of him. At the end of the day, we got promoted over Leeds who had a better squad than we did, so that has be seen as a success imo. > Maybe it's just a preference thing for me but I wasn't particularly impressed by him in the championship either. 

Yeah me too. The silly thing is it all rested on one game - if we lose that playoff final, probably most of the fanbase would say he's not done enough. But you win it and everyone is on a massive high and dubbing everyone involved a legend.

That and the 25-game unbeaten run, which is a bit redundant to point to, because 4th is 4th and 11 losses is 11 losses, regardless of when in the season they happened to come. We also got massively lucky with bad ref calls a couple of times to keep that run going.

For me he was a 7/10 last season. Definitely not a miracle worker who has earnt more faith than the average manager. Agree we only got promotion by the skin of our teeth last season. Some games we looked brilliant but a lot of games we looked very average"

Why? We stabilised in the league last time around, and with less budget. The failures for me this season lie with both Martin and SR - and it’s not like they didn’t have plenty of time to plan and prepare. Neither have. As I have said elsewhere, based on our performance against Liverpool, Martin has shown he can win games at this level (even though we lost, lol). If we can play like that every week, cut out the stupid shit, then we may have a chance under him. 

What I am hoping is that the Wolves game was a massive wake up call for him, as we can't have more games where we have all the ball but do fuck all with it. Forget the ref, even though he had a shocker, 70+% possession and 0 shots on target is an embarrasment."
11608,Southampton,"The referee lost us the Leicester game, no doubt about it. Bollocks. Martin takes off Sugawara (fair enough, he was hurt), shifts KWP from left back to right back and brings Ryan Fraser on... Fatawu was playing down the right by then, who absolutely murdered us twice last year, and then what happens? He absolutely murderers again, when Martin could have either a) left our best full back on him or b) bring an actual LB on to play there (Taylor was on the bench). It was honestly that single decision that cost us the game. Fatawu was running rings around Fraser and Manning, and had a major hand in each of the goals."
11609,Southampton,"Puel is definitely the one that comes to mind. We were 8th and reached a cup final for goodness sake. I don't get how you can look at that with a worse squad and think ""sack.""

It's even worse with hindsight. Next season, we had Pellegrino who took us into a relegation fight needing a Gabbiadini goal vs Swansea to not get relegated. And we haven't really recovered from that despite Hassenhuttl's best efforts. In fairness, puel was close to 17th than 6th that season. The 8th place finish doesn't do it justice Everything needs context. It seems mad to think that way about Puel now but at the time the club and fans had higher expectations.  

We were used to competing, winning and playing exciting football and we lost that with Puel. (the exciting football I mean).

By today's standards we would absolutely love to be playing the way we were under him, but at the time it seemed like a downgrade from Koeman.  

I thought Puel was fine but dull and, at the time, that wasn't enough. But now it would be great. Context. We had definitely been spoiled under Poch & Koeman, Puel was always on a hiding to nothing with our good players leaving all the time unfortunately. In hindsight, similar to now, the board needs to take a lot of the blame. Replacing great players with players ranging from bang average to complete shite."
11610,Southampton,Ah yes you’re quite right 
11611,Southampton,"In his interview post Wolves, he said as much himself, which is why I'm hoping that game was a watershed moment. We played much differently against Liverpool and looked much better for it, so hopefully that continues. "
11612,Southampton,"The reaction to Sunday in some quarters was legit insane. As a coach you cannot legislate for your backup keeper making a cock-up!

But you go online and it’s “THIS MAN IS DESTROYING OUR CLUB”. I don't disagree with you regarding how we performed against Liverpool. But it's more like 'the straw that broke the camel's back' syndrome.  
If this was a one off, I think you would be seeing more people pointing out the positives about how we played.  

But, when you look at this defeat (and the nature of the defeat) in the context of the season so far, it's another example of the players not having the right mentality to deal with adversity and the manager not being tactically flexible enough to change how the team plays when things aren't going our way.  

Taken in isolation, this game was Saints playing well against arguably the best team in the league and having some unlucky moments.  
Taken in context, this game was the players and manager displaying that they are not learning from their mistakes and being cut adrift before Christmas. Yeah. The Ref not giving us the Pen when Kelleher, Bradley and Konate all worked together to foul Armstrong didn't help. Sunday we were legitimately excellent. We looked like a draw was possible right up to the last. We didn’t get many chances but we did something with them. This was the top team against the bottom, the worst attack vs the best defence. It had all the making of a proper arse kicking and we lost a close game by one goal and we put two in.

Those 11 players playing that formation and that way are beating half the league. There’s been plenty of shocking shit played but that was the first time I’ve seen anything that made me think we might stay up."
11613,Southampton,Pot kettle black What’s that you say? You think me being able to understand someone else’s perspective makes me somehow a hypocrite? Where is the entitlement in the above comment?
11614,Southampton,"Redknapp was the worst. He went on national tv saying there was nothing he could do with the bunch of players he had, and they weren't good enough to stay up.

All he had to do was find a half decent centre back and keep his mouth shut. The clown got relegated with Crouch and Phillips up front.

It certainly wasn’t better than Leeds’ I don’t think. I agree in terms of tactics, but one thing that you have to say about Martin is that his man management is very good. Our mentality when we went down was so fragile and negative that I think without him we don't go up because the players were so in the habit of losing. He got the team believing again, so despite our team being good enough to get promoted on talent alone, I do think he deserves a decent amount of credit for our promotion.

I also think that's why we're so shit now, we're not good enough to survive the prem based on vibes alone lol"
11619,Southampton,"At the end of the day, we got promoted over Leeds who had a better squad than we did, so that has be seen as a success imo. "
11620,Southampton,"> Maybe it's just a preference thing for me but I wasn't particularly impressed by him in the championship either. 

Yeah me too. The silly thing is it all rested on one game - if we lose that playoff final, probably most of the fanbase would say he's not done enough. But you win it and everyone is on a massive high and dubbing everyone involved a legend.

That and the 25-game unbeaten run, which is a bit redundant to point to, because 4th is 4th and 11 losses is 11 losses, regardless of when in the season they happened to come. We also got massively lucky with bad ref calls a couple of times to keep that run going.

For me he was a 7/10 last season. Definitely not a miracle worker who has earnt more faith than the average manager. "
11621,Southampton,Agree we only got promotion by the skin of our teeth last season. Some games we looked brilliant but a lot of games we looked very average 
11622,Southampton,"As I have said elsewhere, based on our performance against Liverpool, Martin has shown he can win games at this level (even though we lost, lol). If we can play like that every week, cut out the stupid shit, then we may have a chance under him. 

What I am hoping is that the Wolves game was a massive wake up call for him, as we can't have more games where we have all the ball but do fuck all with it. Forget the ref, even though he had a shocker, 70+% possession and 0 shots on target is an embarrasment. How has Martin showed that? 
This same argument has been brought out quite a few times and nothing has changed. The same thing was said against City too. Facts are facts. In 11 games he has won one, and that run I think everyone at the start of the season would believe we should expect more from. It’s not good enough. 
These mistakes too. So your first choice goalkeeper (who by the way has also made mistakes in similar scenarios I’ll add) is injured, and the backup goalkeeper who isn’t really up to the level is injured for a game against a team who will pick up on any errors you make and hurt you. 

What kind of batshit crazy logic did he employ to think that this outcome would be any different? 

Martins lack of flexibility is what’s causing these errors. That is the fact here. It’s not working and we are bleeding goals at a dangerous rate. 

Thats before we get on to the lack of anything up front. You can point to a lack of quality, but I’ll point to the fact that we were odds on to get promoted last season, and despite again another lack of tactical inflexibility from Russ we still got there. 

That means that RM and SR have had A FUCKING YEAR to scout and work out what’s best. All the while it wouldn’t have taken a genius to see how Burnley fared and think that maybe we need to change our style a little if we are to survive too. 
The only thing explanation I can think of for why he has not is that he thinks he will get a similar job to Kompany by sticking to it. Why else would you do this? It’s a massive risk and sacking could destroy any chance you have of managing at this level again. 

They did fuck all. Nobody expected us to be mid table, that would be unrealistic. But fuck me the bare minimum target should be 17th! There’s no excuse for it not to be. Losing against anyone doesn't show we can win games, that makes no sense whatsoever"
11623,Southampton,"Bollocks. Martin takes off Sugawara (fair enough, he was hurt), shifts KWP from left back to right back and brings Ryan Fraser on... Fatawu was playing down the right by then, who absolutely murdered us twice last year, and then what happens? He absolutely murderers again, when Martin could have either a) left our best full back on him or b) bring an actual LB on to play there (Taylor was on the bench). It was honestly that single decision that cost us the game. Fatawu was running rings around Fraser and Manning, and had a major hand in each of the goals. Key moments were - obvious shirt pull in the box on Onuachu not given. Leicester go up the other end and get a pen for the same thing. At 2-2 the ref plays over 2 minutes over the allocated time added on and Ayew scores. Incompetence of officials the reason we lost."
11624,Southampton,"In fairness, puel was close to 17th than 6th that season. The 8th place finish doesn't do it justice "
11625,Southampton,"Everything needs context. It seems mad to think that way about Puel now but at the time the club and fans had higher expectations.  

We were used to competing, winning and playing exciting football and we lost that with Puel. (the exciting football I mean).

By today's standards we would absolutely love to be playing the way we were under him, but at the time it seemed like a downgrade from Koeman.  

I thought Puel was fine but dull and, at the time, that wasn't enough. But now it would be great. Context. I agree that context needs to be looked at. The season before, Chelsea and Liverpool finished 10th and 8th before going to finish 1st and 4th. That accounts for two places and as much as you could argue that we should be closer to Everton than we were, there's also other reasons for that.

In the summer, we lost Mane and Pelle who combined for 20 goals in each of their two seasons. We replaced Mane with Redmond who had a best season of 7 goals and Austin started who wasn't as prolific or non-injured as we'd like. That's where I look at for what we lost in front of goal. Realistically, if Mane had the same attitude and hadn't left, he'd repeat that. He'd be our top goalscorer in the league by 3.

What he did after leaving Saints just proves how much we lost in him. And we also tried with Boufal who's only highlight was scoring a great solo goal vs West Brom. Beyond that, he barely did anything. That's why I don't blame Puel as much as everybody else.

And in subsequent years, we had Pellegrino who got far less out of the game squad, Hughes who barely did enough to keep us up and then we got lucky with Hassenhuttl. At that time, we were regarded as what Brighton and Brentford are now. 

It's just that now, we didn't hit with signings for seasons."
11626,Southampton,"We had definitely been spoiled under Poch & Koeman, Puel was always on a hiding to nothing with our good players leaving all the time unfortunately. In hindsight, similar to now, the board needs to take a lot of the blame. Replacing great players with players ranging from bang average to complete shite. "
11627,Southampton,"I don't disagree with you regarding how we performed against Liverpool. But it's more like 'the straw that broke the camel's back' syndrome.  
If this was a one off, I think you would be seeing more people pointing out the positives about how we played.  

But, when you look at this defeat (and the nature of the defeat) in the context of the season so far, it's another example of the players not having the right mentality to deal with adversity and the manager not being tactically flexible enough to change how the team plays when things aren't going our way.  

Taken in isolation, this game was Saints playing well against arguably the best team in the league and having some unlucky moments.  
Taken in context, this game was the players and manager displaying that they are not learning from their mistakes and being cut adrift before Christmas. "
11628,Southampton,"Yeah. The Ref not giving us the Pen when Kelleher, Bradley and Konate all worked together to foul Armstrong didn't help. "
11629,Southampton,"Sunday we were legitimately excellent. We looked like a draw was possible right up to the last. We didn’t get many chances but we did something with them. This was the top team against the bottom, the worst attack vs the best defence. It had all the making of a proper arse kicking and we lost a close game by one goal and we put two in.

Those 11 players playing that formation and that way are beating half the league. There’s been plenty of shocking shit played but that was the first time I’ve seen anything that made me think we might stay up. There were certainly some positives to take from the performance but we don't really have the luxury to be pleased with playing well. We need results and we need them any way we can. Personally, and I can only speak for myself, I'm bored of taking isolated positive moments out of a game where we ultimately took nothing from it. Teams in our position need to find ways to win. Playing ugly or whatever that may be. 

We are a Premier League sized club and there is no reason why we shouldn't be able to compete in this league. We're just not getting it right at the moment. It will likely take another stab the season after next (if we're lucky - best case scenario). I don't think that will be under Russell Martin *unless* he can learn from his mistakes and be more flexible in his approach. It doesn't work at this level with the resources he has available.  

Russell Martin seems like a lovely guy. Great man manager, charity raiser. That's all great. But it is not currently translating to points on the board.  

12 games in - 1 win, 1 draw, 10 defeats is damning. I expected to be bottom of the league for some if not the majority of the season. But we are adrift before Christmas with no signs of that changing."
11630,Southampton,"What’s that you say? You think me being able to understand someone else’s perspective makes me somehow a hypocrite? Do you expect an answer to whatever this question is?

11631,Southampton,Where is the entitlement in the above comment? 
11632,Southampton,Not a massive fan of Harry cos of what he did to us but I would say that at least he took us to the last day of the season with a slim hope of survival. We sit here in November pretty much accepting relegation. I personally remember us winning some great games with him in charge. The 4-3 against Norwich and beating Liverpool 2-0 instantly spring to mind. Definitely not the worst manager we've ever had.
11633,Southampton,"I have some sympathy for that view but we’re being left behind by the other promoted teams (one of whom has just sacked their manager due to perceived underperformance) so is our squad quality actually better than them?

They're doing better than us because they set up more pragmatically than we do. Before the start of the season if you'd asked me which of the promoted teams had the weakest squad I'd have said Leicester by quite a distance. They sold their best players in the summer and hadnt seemed to replace them, with an aging vardy who scored like 2 goals their relegation season up front and a back line of faes and vestegaard.

But they've managed to pick up more points than us quite comfortably. Even when we played them we were 2 goals up but couldn't hold on and got nothing from the game."
11634,Southampton,"I agree in terms of tactics, but one thing that you have to say about Martin is that his man management is very good.

I agree on the scouting, but someone people seem to think it's a piece of piss to go out and find a 20 goal a year striker. We fucked Delap up, but again, how is that Martins fault?

Ive argued that Martin is flexible. You can see that from the way we played in the Liverpool game. Still some shit passing around at the back, but much more direct at times and it paid dividends. It was different to performances where we have been praised before."

Nobody said it was easy, but again. A whole year, not only to scout players (for example, ward prowse was available, might not be the most creative midfielder, but 100% a massive upgrade on what we do have, knows the club inside out, and provides assists and goals in this league) and it’s literally their job to do this, not good enough. 
Don’t try and tell me Martin and his stratospheric ego doesn’t have a hand in the transfers. 

I struggle to see anything but Martin chucking stuff at the wall to see if it sticks. It’s not pretty but why have we not tried going more direct more often? Each time we tried it we score! Most of the time we have reverted to not running anywhere near enough, and clubs know they can leave us with the ball now until we inevitably screw ourselves over.

We can argue this back and forth, what he’s doing isn’t working, and has not worked at all. I’ll go as far as saying he isn’t totally at fault, and I miss the Gao/Semmens days because of this.

11650,Southampton,"Happy to take these off your hand mate, if someone else offers cash then fair enough but happy to sort you some away tickets in exchange when you are next over in the UK I appreciate it but sorted them with someone already 👍"
11651,Southampton,I appreciate it but sorted them with someone already 👍 
11652,Southampton,"Short answer: Most of them.

Long, pedantic answer: It’s not really about patience, it’s about getting to the final third in a structured way so you can sustain attacks for longer. The person moaning about getting done on the break should think about how much more often that would happen if we tried to play kick and rush. There would inevitably be more transitions! 

Martin’s game model derives from JDP or ‘positional play’, which is basically about passing the ball to a spare player, creating overloads and trying to play through lines of defenders by doing that. If we had more players who are really powerful so good 1v1 there would be an argument for playing forward earlier, but as it stands we’ve got Tyler and that’s it really.

When it was properly humming last season we’d score goals from Tay-Tay or clipping it over the top or a long ping from Bazunu, but that was because by that point teams were reluctant to press us because we were so good at playing out so there was often no pressure on the ball.

Atm we have an issue where the other team can press really high because they know McCarthy doesn’t have the quality to ping a ball over the top like Rambo or Gav can, and Arma and whoever else knows it too so they stop making top line runs, so we become very one-dimensional and the oppo are emboldened to press higher. Great comment Haven't most our goals come from quick counter attacking? In recent memory, both Liverpool goals, the goal against Everton, and the goal against Arsenal were all on the counter. 

I'd have to go look to be sure though... This is a brilliant analysis."
11653,Southampton,"I've been thinking on this, I don't think the idea of the passing is to get goal scoring opportunities, I think it's to wind up the opposing team by playing keep away, then get goals on the break when they make a silly move, if it works or not is an entire other matter. Just look at how shithousey we've become, it's all a big wind up. "
11654,Southampton,"I think if you're playing this style then you need a striker who can play in front of the opposition defence and keep them guessing with overlaps and so on. Rickie Lambert or Danny Ings would cook in this system, linking up and playing one-twos with Lallana, Dibling and Fernandes

We spent £15m on a striker whose entire MO is getting in behind and finishing one-on-ones, which is the sort of chance you create in a *counter-attacking system*. He doesn't link up with our midfielders in any other way. Nor does BBD, nor does Arma particularly. They're all direct players. It was a baffling decision to go into this season with three of that brand of striker, with this style of play. It's also not fair on those strikers, who have honed that particular direct role over their careers, and now are being asked to either not play it, or just never receive the ball.

The style of play by itself isn't an issue. All styles of play can be effective or ineffective. The issue is a combination of the style of play and the suitability of the players to it. "
11655,Southampton,"None. It just goes back to the defenders then we fuck it up and they have a counter attack and we have to rely on 37 year old lallana sprinting back to defend. Sick of it. 

I couldn’t watch the Liverpool game live (Australia) but caught the highlights before work, as soon as I saw us fucking about at the back with 45 Liverpool shirts around I knew it was going to be a goal. To be fair I went to st Mary’s expecting a four nil loss - especially with the injuries. For the most part they gave a good account of themselves and almost won against the top table club which I was pleasantly surprised by. The sheer weirdness of the starting line up and the willingness to be more direct did suggest encouraging signs of a bit more flexibility and pragmatism."

11660,Southampton,"Generally don’t disagree but I think it will all boil down to who wants the players and how much they’ll offer. We’ve already shown last year we won’t sell cheap, so someone like THB you’d imagine would command quite a huge fee

Can’t see anyone better than us wanting BBD at all, and there’s a *chance* we keep Fernandes and less likely Dibling (who will have an issue with his contract if we keep him soon…) due to their respective ages "
11661,Southampton,"I think we likely lose Sugawara if we go down. He’s definitely prem standard and I can see a midtable club grabbing him. And while we’d like to sell Sulemana I’m not sure we’ll manage to. I also think BBD might stay, he’s not had the greatest run in top flight football and might benenfit from a season in the championship. "
11662,Southampton,"Sugawara, downes, maybe someone takes Armstrong but other than those three I think will leave, the rest are spot on "
11663,Southampton,"Moot point as we aren’t sacking Martin. We’re on 4 points after 12 games, if they had plans to sack the manager based on point performance he’d been gone by now. Honestly I don’t think we survive the season like that. 

St Mary’s is apathetic now, it’ll be truely toxic if this doesn’t change. 

We really are praying for a miracle aren’t we? Unfortunately you’re probably right, the plan for SR seems to be to get relegated then pop straight back up. Outside of Ramsdale all of our signings have been players who’ll either stick around post relegation or will be flipped for profit. And we can probably at least break even on Ramsdale.

My concern is that:

a) Promotion is far from guaranteed (especially if City get relegated with us /s)

b) The morale hit from relegation might keep us down. Note that both us and Leicester swapped managers before getting promoted last season, providing a sort of fresh start.

c) We’ll almost certainly lose Dibling if we go down. We likely can’t hold onto him long term anyway, but I would have liked to have kept him for at least a couple of seasons."
11664,Southampton,"Why would it be ironic? Anyone who doesnt thibk Moyes is a good manager is a numpty.

The issue is gelling his philosophy with what SR clearly want to do, he wouldnt be a good fit long term. "
11665,Southampton,"Moyes would be my number one target tbh

He’s favourite for Leicester rn however and it’s an easy choice between us and them tbh "
11666,Southampton,"He'd be a sticking plaster on issues that neither he nor Martin are responsible for, and would likely make us pretty miserable even if we stayed up this season, and would rather have Martin if we went back down. "
11667,Southampton,Id have Moyes if Martin goes but I dont think that's happening. I think he'd make the most of what we've got. Not a long term solution but probably the best chance of keeping us up. 
11668,Southampton,Fuck it let's go for Ten Haag instead 
11669,Southampton,I don’t think changing management is going to keep us up im not gonna lie 
11670,Southampton,I'm not sure even Moyes who puts a solid back 4 out could work with Stephens. 
11671,Southampton,Lots of people think it and they’re all wrong. 
11672,Southampton,"Honestly I don’t think we survive the season like that. 

St Mary’s is apathetic now, it’ll be truely toxic if this doesn’t change. 

We really are praying for a miracle aren’t we? I think the board is as stubborn as the manager. They did the same with Nathan Jones. We all knew from his second match in charge. After being smashed Brighton, he wasn't cut out for it. Yet he stayed far too long in the building.

And I think the same thing will happen with Russell, he will be sacked if carry on this trajectory (and we will). However, that won't be until January/February. Yet the board seem to be waiting for a miracle? And the fans are sat their embarrassed every single game as we continue to play this ""style of football"""
11673,Southampton,"Unfortunately you’re probably right, the plan for SR seems to be to get relegated then pop straight back up. Outside of Ramsdale all of our signings have been players who’ll either stick around post relegation or will be flipped for profit. And we can probably at least break even on Ramsdale.

My concern is that:

a) Promotion is far from guaranteed (especially if City get relegated with us /s)

b) The morale hit from relegation might keep us down. Note that both us and Leicester swapped managers before getting promoted last season, providing a sort of fresh start.

c) We’ll almost certainly lose Dibling if we go down. We likely can’t hold onto him long term anyway, but I would have liked to have kept him for at least a couple of seasons. I totally agree. If not only for point b) … this club has the weakest mentality I’ve ever seen so hedging our bets on yo-yo-ing is utterly insane in my opinion. 

But what do we know."

If anything they’ve gone the complete other direction"

But what do we know. "
11676,Southampton,"I don’t think Jones is a good example of us sticking with a manager for too long at all lol 

If anything they’ve gone the complete other direction Do you? For me it felt like he should've been gone ages before he was. For context, he managed 14 games. Russell Martin has had the same, this season."
11677,Southampton,"Do you? For me it felt like he should've been gone ages before he was. For context, he managed 14 games. Russell Martin has had the same, this season. "
11678,Southampton,"Only the Northam has ever sung, with some of Kingsland. Nothings changed and its been like that for years now. I moved from Kingsland to Northam this year because I really had enough with just sat down all game and nobody joining in.

I think its an age thing. Everyone young I know wants to stand and chant, everyone old doesnt. Exactly same here but formerly Chapel - there were talks of people abandoning Northam to be near the away fans but clearly that was never serious especially when they said anyone persistently standing would be thrown out 

But let’s not pretend the atmosphere has gotten any worse when it’s always been one of the worst in the league"
11679,Southampton,"I’m in the Kingsland/Northam corner and I could barely hear the Liverpool fans. From my spot they were loud and constant. Obviously away support is always vocal they just struck me as particularly loud. Maybe I was just closer🤷🏻‍♂️ 
Other than Wembley and Bristol city away in the cup in ´03 I’ve not been away with saints."
11680,Southampton,"This is nonsense. The Liverpool fans were silent for 90% of the game. Fair enough. Seemed constant from where I was. A few of my mates have said the seemed loud on the tv. 

Any thoughts on atmosphere generally? I do love these comments, see them after every home game. Complete denial that the away fans made any noise at all when in reality week in week out they come here and out sing our stadium.

To suggest the pool fans were silent 90% of the game is ridiculous"
11681,Southampton,"Liverpool fans sounded loud on Sky but they were probably miked up. Chapel end always makes me cringe. Whenever we score the fans take ages to get out their seats. 

Our fans can be rocking when they want to be, take the play off semi vs West Brom The West Brom game sounded amazing on tv."
11682,Southampton,"You only really hear what you are near to at St Marys, i'm in Kingsland/Northam corner and I have barely heard a peep from any away fans all season, except for immediately after goals. 

As for Saints building an atmosphere I think its fair to give fans the benefit of the doubt when we are in the middle of our worst ever start to a season in history. "
11683,Southampton,"Thanks. I don’t get down as often as I’d like, so interesting to get some perspective. 
I’ve seen a few comments about the atmosphere on here over the years so wondered what people’s thoughts were. "
11684,Southampton,"Can you imagine the shit we’d get if we printed out chant sheets, ha. I don’t think that’s the issue anyway. I’ve been going with my Dad on and off for nearly 30 years and it takes something completely extraordinary for him to even uncross his arms, let alone sing. Lack of atmosphere is partly about poor recent results, partly about young people being priced out of going every week (true of most clubs though). There are obviously exceptions - West Brom was incredible Was just spitballing. We would get roasted!
My last 6 games have all been wins including the Blackpool cup win under Jones. Until Sunday my son had only ever seen us win live. So we’ve been lucky."
11685,Southampton,"Sounded like a decent atmosphere on tv. Liverpool only really seemed to make themselves heard after going 3-2 up.

I’ve been to games at St Mary’s and come away with my ears ringing and thinking the whole stadium sounded electric, watched the highlights and it sounds completely flat. A lot has to do with where you’re sitting in the ground, and if watching on telly a lot of it depends on which stands are miked up heavily which is usually the away fans at St Mary’s, especially when Sky are broadcasting. Thanks. I don’t get down as often as I’d like, so interesting to get some perspective. I’ve seen a few comments about the atmosphere on here over the years so wondered what people’s thoughts were."
11686,Southampton,They should make a safe standing section and reduce price of tickets for normal people to get in… I’d be vocal if it was affordable and bring my son with me and make him vocal too.. too many middle aged men who like to just sit there arms folded. 
11687,Southampton,"Exactly same here but formerly Chapel - there were talks of people abandoning Northam to be near the away fans but clearly that was never serious especially when they said anyone persistently standing would be thrown out 

But let’s not pretend the atmosphere has gotten any worse when it’s always been one of the worst in the league I always think we’ve got room to improve, but I don’t think we’re anywhere close to being the worst in the league. I’ve never been to Goodson for example, but whenever Everton are on Sky the atmosphere sends me to sleep, very rarely do I witness that sort of silence at St Mary’s apart from perhaps the occasional early round league cup fixture.

I just wish as a fan base we were a bit more proactive instead of just reactive. I only watched on Sky so take this with a pinch of salt, but at 2-1 on Sunday the place sounded great, but as soon as Liverpool equalised it just died. That’s always frustrated me as something our fan base seems to struggle with, we do occasionally lift the team when they need it, but it should be happening all the time, that’s what supporters are there for. We just seem to let our heads drop too easily and that usually reflects on the players. Any thoughts on why?"
11688,Southampton,"From my spot they were loud and constant. Obviously away support is always vocal they just struck me as particularly loud. Maybe I was just closer🤷🏻‍♂️ 
Other than Wembley and Bristol city away in the cup in ´03 I’ve not been away with saints. The fact you could hear Liverpool loud and clear while being next to them but not the Northam probably says it all

There were a few instances of them making a lot of noise, but for the most part of the game they did not. I was also at the United home game and the United fans were extremely loud and sang all game.

11695,Southampton,"Any thoughts on why? I think on the whole the atmosphere just correlates to results / form, but I also think the same for a lot of clubs.

Under Adkins, Poch & Koeman the atmospheres were great, regardless of what league we were in, because we were competitive and winning games.

As we gradually got less competitive under Hass, and the football got stale, the atmosphere went the same way until we got relegated. 

Last year it improved again because we were competitive in the Championship, and the hope was back (the WBA semi was the best St Marys atmosphere I've experienced).

Now we are back in the Premier League and we aren't competitive, the atmosphere reflects that. It might be different if the novelty of playing sides like Liverpool, United etc was still there. But after 11/12 years of playing them every year, it just isn't there anymore like it was in the Adkins - Poch era.

That being said I don't think its unique to Southampton. Newcastle and Villa weren't exactly renowned for their home support when they were struggling. I remember Villa Park in 2016 being the most toxic home support I'll probably ever witness. And Leicester these days are a long way off what they were in that same period when they won the league.

When we are competitive the atmosphere improves, regardless of what league we're in."
11696,Southampton,"The fact you could hear Liverpool loud and clear while being next to them but not the Northam probably says it all

11701,Southampton,I get that. I was opposite them. I guess I was just struck by the lack of noise from the chapel/itchen end. 
11702,Southampton,One of the bright sparks in a poor team. Don't imagine he'll be with us much longer. Reckon he’s gonna go for a big move regardless of survival then? Wouldn’t mind him at Chelsea but obviously we have a million players and he’d fall victim to the loan system Scored against Liverpool. That's a guarantee they'll buy him soon.
11703,Southampton,"Been our best player this year. One of the few in the team that looks like he belongs at this level. Great energy, picks out some superb passes, has a couple of goals and always getting stuck in to tackles. That’s pretty much how I’d have described him last season. Comfortably the best player in a poor Estoril side. Proper central midfielder. Really glad to hear he’s doing well"
11704,Southampton,"Guaranteed £30m+ for him when he leaves this summer, outstanding player "
11705,Southampton,"If we somehow manage to survive, he’ll play a huge role in it. I love his vision of the pitch, and making smart passes. Gonna be sad when he goes onto bigger things, but i’ll continue to have false hope him and tyler dibling both decide to stay, and build Southampton into a contender again. "
11706,Southampton,Hi Ruben 👋 
11707,Southampton,He’s excellent in possession and an absolute tank out of possession. He’s going to the very top (or to Man United with Amorim). 
11708,Southampton,"My favourite player alongside Dibling in this team. He’s simply fantastic. Passing, tackling, pressing, shooting everything. 

See no reason why he wont be at United, makes far too much sense. He’s not ready yet but he will be "
11709,Southampton,"Last game, surprisingly he was used in the middle in a three man midfield, slightly behind the other two, in a more playmaking role. He did still make forward runs, and did not make any grave positional errors. Mostly he has been playing in a more wide midfield role, carrying the ball forward, and keeping posesion of the ball. He started cautiously, I think, in the first few games, but he has grown into by a mile the best midfielder in the Southampton team. Unless we survive the drop (quite unlikely by now), he should leave for a better team, as he is way to good for championship football. 



He would be a first team starter next year in many teams imho. Example would be top team in France or Italy, Dortmund or Leverkusen or solid midtable PL team  - my guess. "
11710,Southampton,"He is brilliant, I am sure he will move to a bigger club in the summer and I wish him the best of luck. "
11711,Southampton,"going to copy this message i sent this weekend to my brother after his goal as it basically sums it up:

> Flown under the radar because we've been so shit, but fernandes has absolutely been our deal of the summer, he is far too good for us "
11712,Southampton,Not a Saints fan however take my kids (we’re season ticket holders). As a neutral if Saints go down then it’s going to hurt as I don’t see how you keep hold of him. Been a bit of a revelation and is going to go for a decent amount of money. 
11713,Southampton,Yeah he is good but imagine he and Alcaraz in the midfield and we didn't get BBD - eh Martin? Time to move on I think mate. He’s an upgrade on Alcaraz in every sense.
11714,Southampton,"Reckon he’s gonna go for a big move regardless of survival then? Wouldn’t mind him at Chelsea but obviously we have a million players and he’d fall victim to the loan system I think he'd be silly not to. Much higher ceiling than getting hacked to pieces in the championship. Would love to keep him though, the kid is going places.

Edit: we're not surviving lol. While you're here; do you know what's going on with Jimmy Jay Morgan? 18 yr old who you signed from us last year, not heard about him since. Was in the same class as Tyler Dibling. I reckon he'll move to a big team, probably somewhere like Aston Villa or Newcastle, maybe Man U if Amorim wants him, could also see him moving to La liga or Serie A as well."
11715,Southampton,Scored against Liverpool. That's a guarantee they'll buy him soon.

Edit: we're not surviving lol. Good to know. The move to Southampton worried me a bit cos I didn’t wanna see him around the bottom of the league but if it’s given him the opportunity to shine then I can be happy with that"
11719,Southampton,"While you're here; do you know what's going on with Jimmy Jay Morgan? 18 yr old who you signed from us last year, not heard about him since. Was in the same class as Tyler Dibling.

11720,Southampton,"I reckon he'll move to a big team, probably somewhere like Aston Villa or Newcastle, maybe Man U if Amorim wants him, could also see him moving to La liga or Serie A as well. Beginning of the season I said depending on how he does will determine which team in Portugal he’ll end up at. Could see him go to one of the big 3, back at Sporting maybe after a season at a different club"
11721,Southampton,Who Fernandes? Obviously not BBD!
11722,Southampton,"Good to know. The move to Southampton worried me a bit cos I didn’t wanna see him around the bottom of the league but if it’s given him the opportunity to shine then I can be happy with that Saints are a proven development team, the original Brighton, think of players like Mane and VVD, more recently Lavia. I think it was a perfect move for him, guaranteed game time and an introduction into the Premier League and putting him in the eye of bigger clubs, all while improving himself and his game."
11723,Southampton,Don’t hear a peep out of him this season tbh mate. Genuinely forgot all about him. I remember now that he was doing alright for the youth sides last season but this season it’s like he doesn’t exist

11727,Southampton,He was injured for a loooong time and has never really come back properly. 
11728,Southampton,"I suspect that where we’ve got several players atm (Kamaldeen, Cornet to name but two) who haven’t been as effective as we’d have hoped because they’ve struggled for fitness and/or don’t quite trust their bodies to do the high-intensity stuff that we need them to do, there’s a reluctance to integrate another. "
11729,Southampton,"There was a video on instagram earlier in the season where he was warming up with the women’s team. 

Playing wise, four games in the under 21s - not been in the squad for the last couple of Premier League 2 games though [source](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/juan-larios/leistungsdaten/spieler/646738) "
11730,Southampton,"Spoiler alert, OP is Alex McCarthy "
11731,Southampton,"Tactics had nothing to do with Salah’s first goal though did it, no one to blame but McCarthy - and to be honest, the first goal they scored came from his hands so not being good with his feet is irrelevant isn’t it. 

Say what you want about Martin but we lost 3-2 to top of the league and their goals were 2 keeper errors and a sloppy pen… But yeah definitely sack him, I’m sure we would have won 2-0 with Moyes in charge Absolutely crazy that people think Martin lost that game. Without those errors we win the game. 

I went into that expecting us to be smashed 4-0 and yet we weren’t. Liverpool never looked like they were going to run away with it. The team was set up very well, pressing quickly when they moved the ball around. We obviously lacked their technical ability, AA’s first touch being levels below pool’s first team for example. That game was positive, but we have still been awful keeping Martin will do nothing but guarantee us championship football next season First goal was downes fluffing a clearance wasnt it? No actual pressure on him either. I mean macca's decision to roll out wasn't great but there were a couple chances to clear it before they scored. Gotta give credit where it's due.

Second goal he's 100% lost positionally and he could have been a hero instead of a chump BUT I'm more annoyed that one ball over the top beats our defence and Salah probably not going to miss one on one anyway. Same happened with Everton but var came to the rescue. 10 defeats in 12 games, but sure, it’s nothing to do with the manager. The only alternative is Moyes, and he would’ve lost 12 out of 12!

There couldn’t possibly be any other managerial options, and no one could possibly do any better."
11732,Southampton,"Good with his feet? Wtf are you talking about. He threw the ball at a defender before his box was remotely clear for the first and decided to sprint off his line for a ball he was never going to get for the second whilst equally not positioning himself at all to block the shot.

McCarthy cost us yesterday plain and simple, blaming Martin or anyone other than the keeper is ludicrous. I think Downes needs to cop some blame for yesterday aswell.  Did you not see Harwood-Bellis tell McCarthy to play that ball?"
11733,Southampton,"Yeah you’ve got to feel for Mccarthy, obviously he’s not great but he’s an aging championship keeper in a system he clearly isn’t built for trying to play against Liverpool with Jack bloody Stephen’s holding the line infront of him. 34 isn’t particularly old for a goalkeeper though I agree with the rest."
11734,Southampton,After sleeping off my hangover I realised I was a bit rash with my post 
11735,Southampton,"At the end of the day, McCarthy isn't close top Premier League quality and Martin is sticking to his game plan, no matter what, despite needing about £800M spending on a squad overhaul to play that kind of football.

Steve Cooper has just been sacked despite obvious improvements under him, after only 12 games.  
How long are we going to give both Martin and McCarthy?

Martin either needs to change the way he sets up the team and his tactics, or leave. McCarthy just needs to play League One. "
11736,Southampton,"'it could well be that backup goalkeeper Alex McCarthy has cost current boss Russell Martin his job'.

No Russell Martin has cost Russell Martin his job. That is if the seemingly unsackable man finally meets his overdue fate. Totally. Martin is driving me insane"
11737,Southampton,Not being good with his feet has nothing to do with his disaster for the 2nd goal. God knows where he was going leaving the goal wide open with the angle he took ! 
11738,Southampton,Both things can be true at the same time. 
11739,Southampton,We keep conceding goals from turnovers in our own half (the most in the league). There’s clearly a tactical issue there (and teams set up against us to exploit it) even if individual error is partly to blame also. 
11740,Southampton,"Well all their goals came from errors on our part, but McCarthy also made a bunch of saves. "
11741,Southampton,"Liverpool fan so the first time this season I have really seen the Saints properly. 

Your players are good enough to stay up. Russell Martin clearly doesn’t care about the club, he is there for him and trying to do some version of a Kompany. Your attackers are brilliant on the counter and there is no reason at all to play out like that under so much pressure. Doesn’t suit your defenders at all even if Ramsdale plays. 

If you can find a manager to get compact off the ball and play on the counter, similar to how Forrest are going about it, you could easily give staying up this season a real shake. "
11742,Southampton,"I will die on the hill that McCarthy is 1) not to blame, and 2) a good keeper. 

Martin's arogance to mske a 30 plus keeper who did not grow up playing out from the back is a crazy decision. And you all know its not just Alex who feels pressured to play that way. I don't think he's a good keeper or a bad one he's ok, can stop a shot when needed but won't do anything remarkable Delusional"
11743,Southampton,"McCarthy has been proven as shit at Martins style, so it's on Martin if he picks him. Lumley may not be as good a keeper but hasn't dropped any bollocks passing out from the back has he? "
11744,Southampton,"Absolutely crazy that people think Martin lost that game. Without those errors we win the game. 

I went into that expecting us to be smashed 4-0 and yet we weren’t. Liverpool never looked like they were going to run away with it. The team was set up very well, pressing quickly when they moved the ball around. We obviously lacked their technical ability, AA’s first touch being levels below pool’s first team for example. We also had Lallana and Onuachu going off injured fairly early on too affecting things - Onuachu was doing great holding it up until that point Come on. We all know McCarthy can’t pass well and our defense has been making these same mistakes all season. Yes, Martin is not the one making individual mistakes. But he is watching a team that continues to make these mistakes while paying his style but continues to make them play the same style. Still trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. McCarthys pass to the top of the box is one we’ve done all season no matter who is in goal and it has cost us multiple goals or opportunities to the opponent. This pass has obviously been coached, very poorly. 
There ball over the top is just poor defending and Downes, playing out of position as CB, playing Salah onside. McCarthy didn’t need to come but the offside trap was abysmal. ""Without those errors we win the game."" - True of a lot of matches so far this season."
11745,Southampton,"That game was positive, but we have still been awful keeping Martin will do nothing but guarantee us championship football next season I’m not against a change, I’ll say that for sure - I just want to highlight that criticisms should be relevant, yesterday was indeed positive and it was individual mistakes that cost us in the end - maybe injuries playing a part too - Martins style of play did not cause McCarthys mistakes as this post it insinuating"
11746,Southampton,"First goal was downes fluffing a clearance wasnt it? No actual pressure on him either. I mean macca's decision to roll out wasn't great but there were a couple chances to clear it before they scored. Gotta give credit where it's due.

Same happened with Everton but var came to the rescue. Downes having to clear under pressure because of a horror pass from McCarthy that he did not need to make - he had the ball in his hands, it’s a lot easier for him to not fuck up from that position than outfield players under pressure in our box"
11747,Southampton,"10 defeats in 12 games, but sure, it’s nothing to do with the manager. The only alternative is Moyes, and he would’ve lost 12 out of 12!

There couldn’t possibly be any other managerial options, and no one could possibly do any better. The whole thread, including my comment, is about yesterdays game - have any comments on that? Would any available managers have done better yesterday? What did he get wrong tactics wise? 

He’s clearly not doing well but trying to pin yesterday on him is laughable"
11748,Southampton,I think Downes needs to cop some blame for yesterday aswell.  
11749,Southampton,Did you not see Harwood-Bellis tell McCarthy to play that ball? 
11750,Southampton,34 isn’t particularly old for a goalkeeper though I agree with the rest.

11755,Southampton,"Come on. We all know McCarthy can’t pass well and our defense has been making these same mistakes all season. Yes, Martin is not the one making individual mistakes. But he is watching a team that continues to make these mistakes while paying his style but continues to make them play the same style. Still trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. McCarthys pass to the top of the box is one we’ve done all season no matter who is in goal and it has cost us multiple goals or opportunities to the opponent. This pass has obviously been coached, very poorly. 
There ball over the top is just poor defending and Downes, playing out of position as CB, playing Salah onside. McCarthy didn’t need to come but the offside trap was abysmal. It’s not even about passing well, it’s decision making. The instruction to the keeper is never “pass immediately to the first person you see even if they’re surrounded by players” - it’s not an error from a normal, play out from the back, pass - it’s from an out and out terrible decision that a keeper shouldn’t make"
11756,Southampton,"""Without those errors we win the game."" - True of a lot of matches so far this season. "
11757,Southampton,"I’m not against a change, I’ll say that for sure - I just want to highlight that criticisms should be relevant, yesterday was indeed positive and it was individual mistakes that cost us in the end - maybe injuries playing a part too - Martins style of play did not cause McCarthys mistakes as this post it insinuating "
11758,Southampton,"Downes having to clear under pressure because of a horror pass from McCarthy that he did not need to make - he had the ball in his hands, it’s a lot easier for him to not fuck up from that position than outfield players under pressure in our box Downes had more than enough time to make the right decision but he didn't. He should of held his composure and kicked the ball out for a corner or a throw instead kicking it straight to the Liverpool fc player. Yeah but the actual error is downes and he's not actually being closed down at the time he mishits it. Could have just booted it up the pitch. You can see it on his face when it happens."
11759,Southampton,"The whole thread, including my comment, is about yesterdays game - have any comments on that? Would any available managers have done better yesterday? What did he get wrong tactics wise? 

He’s clearly not doing well but trying to pin yesterday on him is laughable "
11760,Southampton,"It’s not even about passing well, it’s decision making. The instruction to the keeper is never “pass immediately to the first person you see even if they’re surrounded by players” - it’s not an error from a normal, play out from the back, pass - it’s from an out and out terrible decision that a keeper shouldn’t make The thing is, yeah McCarthy made mistakes but you just wouldn't put your keeper under that pressure if you know he's bad with his feet and facing a team that presses high up the pitch. The amount of times our midfield or defense start with the ball in the box facing our own goal is just madness.

I would love to do it most of the time but if you can't adapt your style a bit to account for the day it's just poor organisation. But it’s a decision we keep making and keep getting punished for. Doesn’t matter who’s in goal or got the ball in our box, these passes keep happening so we have to assume they are being coached to make these passes.
All good and well if the recipient in Rodri or kdb. But it’s not, it’s Fernandez who is a great player but new to a lazier of this pace, Flynn Downes who seems a bit off the pace at this level. RM don’t seem to realize we don’t have the quality not only to make the right decision of a pass, but to receive the pass. 
We can do it okay 8/10 times but that means 2/10 we’re conceding a shot on goal. Insanity is making the same mistake over and over but expecting a different outcome"
11761,Southampton,"Downes had more than enough time to make the right decision but he didn't. He should of held his composure and kicked the ball out for a corner or a throw instead kicking it straight to the Liverpool fc player. It’s not fifa, Downes is on the receiving end of a bad pass, a pass that was bad because of being under a lot of pressure. Downes is still under pressure as he’s in our box and being chased down - we’re terrible defending corners so bad option, and the attacker moves to cut off the clearance to throw so he kicks upfield and miss hits it - all of this is avoided if McCarthy holds on the ball - and trying to blame Martin or Downes here is just mental gymnastics"
11762,Southampton,"Yeah but the actual error is downes and he's not actually being closed down at the time he mishits it. Could have just booted it up the pitch. You can see it on his face when it happens. No it isn’t, the error is McCarthy which then calls Downes to try and clean up under pressure - honestly can you not appreciate that the keeper should not be rolling it out to someone surrounded by opposition on the edge of our box - it is infinitely a harder position than McCarthy who has the ball in his hands. If he waits and plays a better pass to someone with space we don’t concede there. Yes obviously if Downes plays a wonder pass we don’t either but he shouldn’t be asked to, you have to be realistic."

I would love to do it most of the time but if you can't adapt your style a bit to account for the day it's just poor organisation. Right, I don’t necessarily disagree, the system does make it harder overall for the keeper and back line, they’re asked to do more - but what pressure are we talking about yesterday? If holding the ball in your hands is pressure you probably shouldn’t be in goal, no?  The ball over the top yeah ok he’s been played onside so McCarthy has been let down maybe but he doesn’t even give him self a chance to make a save, he over commits the wrong way and the first touch ends up in the net - that’s nothing to do with the system of how we play"

11768,Southampton,"To be fair while this stat sounds incredibly damning it doesn't actually mean anything at all.

The only stat that matters is the 5 points between us and 17th. 5 will become 12 fairly soonish if we don't win quick enough"
11769,Southampton,"Russ, 10 points all season is not a record to be proud of. Sure it is. Just not in football. He’s definitely the type to be proud of that as well the arrogant fucker"
11770,Southampton,"I swear Newcastle didn’t win in the first 14 the season of the takeover? It’s really not that we’re not winning entirely, but the way we are playing and letting goals in. We are not just getting unlucky, it typically looks like the other team controls the game even when we have the majority of possession. Like they know we’re can’t break them down, and know eventually they will step in on the press, cut out a back line pass, and score. They didn't, but only lost 7 of their first 14."
11771,Southampton,"My issue with sticking with Martin is that, when we are relegated, they will likely stick with him as this approach worked for us in the Championship and it would obviously be expensive to bin him off.  

Working on the assumption that we are then promoted again, we are just back in this position.  

The crux of the matter is that this style of football does not work in the Premier League unless you have the right quality of players to execute it. Which we don't have and will continue to not have for the forseeable.  

Three options then:  
*Change the approach (manager is stubborn and won't/can't).   
*Change the players (too expensive to sign better players and they won't come anyway).  
*Change the manager to one who has a more appropriate approach - only viable option "

11777,Southampton,"They didn't, but only lost 7 of their first 14. "
11778,Southampton,"This, in a nutshell, is our problem:   
*""The routine has become familiar.* [*Southampton*](https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton) *play their goal-kicks short. They pass the ball neatly. They have a lot of possession; 56.6% – only three teams in the Premier League are averaging more. They don’t take their chances – no side have hit a lower percentage of shots on target this season. Somebody makes a mistake – perhaps one of their players, perhaps the referee – they concede and the game is lost.""*

And the reason...  
*""The truth is that it probably doesn’t matter how Martin plays: the squad simply isn’t good enough. Compare these players with the Southampton team promoted in 2012. In that first season, when Nigel Adkins was replaced as manager by Mauricio Pochettino, the squad included a pair of future England full-backs in Nathaniel Clyne and Luke Shaw, a regular goalscorer in Rickie Lambert, in Maya Yoshida and José Fonte two centre-backs who would go on to play regularly for their countries, plus a hard-working and well-balanced midfield of Morgan Schneiderlin, Adam Lallana, Steven Davis, Jack Cork and Jason Puncheon. The present crop – who on Sunday host the Premier League leaders, Liverpool – just isn’t of the same calibre.""*

And the cause of that?  
*""Fundamentally, Southampton’s struggles aren’t about style; they’re a symptom of the increasing financial stratification of football. Without extremely enlightened recruitment, staying up for any promoted side is incredibly difficult – and there’s not much Martin can do that will change that.""* Yeah I mean if he’d engaged a bit more closely with SFC he might have mentioned Rasmus’s desperate spending spree in Jan ‘23, which was still hobbling us in the summer. But for a casual observer he’s spot on."
11779,Southampton,"You need good players to play the way we play. You don't need as good players to play the way Ipswich or Leicester play. I beg of you mate, do not, for a second, think playing the way we (Leicester) play is anything to strive for. 

You guys actually looked like you had a go against Liverpool, albeit a bit suicidal at times, we just don’t even bother playing in any games, you guys would have beaten us had you not gone down to 10 and gotten a deserved penalty too. You need good players to play any way in the modern Premier League, I don’t really see that that’s arguable tbh You need good players in the prem mate what is this take. Its no surprise that the weakest of the promoted teams are performing the weakest this season."
11780,Southampton,"I agree that I don’t believe we have a good enough squad. But we’ve seen teams manage lesser players to tight, hard to beat defensive tactics, and more direct goal threats. This at least gives a chance of getting points. With a lesser squad, we have no chance with these tactics. We rarely break down teams even with possession. And we give away free chances multiple times per game, even more than gets scored against us. There has been no games this season where it doesn’t look like the other team will inevitably score. 
We can’t blame it purely on the players we have. To be more direct you need power and pace, which we don’t have. To park the bus you need excellent defenders, which we also don’t have."
11781,Southampton,"Martin's tactics right now are the equivalent of sticking a top 6 striker on every team we play because in almost game the backpassing directly leads to a goal or at the very least a close chance. The offense is terrible no matter what so having a manager whose tactics aren't just bad but are actively putting players in such obviously bad positions that you can listen to the commentators give you an ""I told you so"" every game when the inevitable goal goes in is fireable on its own.  Personality aside, this is worse than Nathan Jones because at least his tactics were so bad the team couldn't play it. Martin's tactics look like a drill intentionally designed to allow the offense to work on pressing and scoring

You could make the case that starting the season with a manager who just said ""clear it"" every time we got in danger and we'd have conceded half the goals we have and be 17th, even with a terrible attack.

I take issue with the comparison with the previous promotion team. A good manager has journalists looking back and saying we had a strong GK in Ramsdale, league standard wingbacks and an England international in THB, a bright young midfielder in Matheus, a starlet in Dibbling, target in Paul, and an industrious winger in Adarma. 

This team is or at least was at the start of the season capable of scraping by in the 30-40pt range. Martin's tactics are such a malice that fans would probably be happy to see us finish on 20pts. "
11782,Southampton,This guy can say whatever he wants. But saints need to get it fucking forward This guy literally wrote the book on football tactics. I think he knows more than you.
11783,Southampton,At this point this guy is guaranteed his job if the board won't sack him by now - we need him to realise his faults and resign. Can he go on some sort of self awakening trip somewhere for a couple of weeks. Maybe to the Himalayas 
11784,Southampton,"Ok article and yes there is truth in the issues raised relating to finances. But the blanket suggestion of lack of quality is misinformed. Seems we are accepting of RMs excuses week in and week out 'the players are still learning , there are things we need to work on'. Which slyly suggests he knows what he's doing and the players are a work in progress. Players are always a work in progress and RM doesn't know what he's doing. Yesterday showed that there is enough quality on the pitch and we could be doing a whole lot better if we set up differently. Our second goal was a devastating counter attack. Dibling, Fernandes, THB, KWP,  are good players. Then there is Ramsdale  and the left back (although he didn't too well when he came on yesterday. 
For me , I'm sick of hearing the same thing ; another manager would get more from these players than RM - and if we add a striker in January?  "
11785,Southampton,"This is so accurate it hurts my soul. Watching our football at the moment you can see the moments when doom is expected to happen, the fumble at the back, the lost ball triggering a counter against us. It's apparent when we miss out on an attack opportunity. I know football isn't a constant forward game, but seeing the ball in the middle 3rd of the pitch, only to see it go BACK to our defensive 3rd of the pitch is rage inducing.  
  
We have a unremarkable Manager, using unique tactics and management. Our squad is overall average with a few exceptions, but nothing massively standout-ish. One of those alone wouldn't be a death sentence, it's fixable. You can finance a weak squad, you can replace a manager that isn't maximising the potential of their squad.

But together those circumstances create a storm of mediocrity. We need financial miracle, which would likely run afoul of financial fair play rules, and we don't carry the clout to throw that off like Man City and the rest (yeah I went there). Or we need to find some who is able to come in and make the most of this squad, who would need as much time as we have left of the season to make something out of them.

Unless something drastic happens and we get ourselves a Christmas Miracle, we ARE going right back down. And for me that spells even more doom for us, because the powers that be in charge will stay with Martin and should we have another season like last in the Championship, we'll likely spend another season there. We were lucky to get promoted last season, and whilst I was glad we won the play-offs, we didn't deserve it out right like many said we did. "

I can’t say I’m a massive fan of it, but we need to be a bit more pragmatic, drop the passing out from the back and play a bit longer. Stop inviting pressure onto our own box and we may well find we accumulate a few more positive results. 

Russ ain’t going to do that, and that’s why he needs to be moved on. 

Survival in the league comes first, then once we have a more capable squad then we can build a style of play that will compete with the mid table teams."

11822,Southampton,"Tall Paul was good 👍 

Nice to have a forward that can hold the ball up He’ll probably be out now and they’ll flog him in Jan 👍 He looked great, but most of his hold up play was deep in our own half with very few runners  going forward. That one piece of skill required him to beat 4 guys before there was a decent pass on"
11823,Southampton,"Not a great time to be living with a Liverpool fan right now I live in London mate, think how I feel. Can’t move for Liverpool fans."
11824,Southampton,"1st Liv goal - can’t play out the back v Liverpool = gift

2nd Liv goal - Macca commits… Macca screws up = gift

3rd Liverpool goal - Chest to hand in natural position = gift from PL

60 mins Pull on Armstrong shirt = gift from PL Yeah Macca all out of position there for the second goal. Still not happy that one long ball takes everyone out. Same as Everton but without the offside."
11825,Southampton,"Showing the pulling the shirt of Armstrong about 10 times on Norwegian tv... we had a penalty against us v Leicester for less... also, chest to hand shouldn’t be a penalty.... Lucky lucky Liverpool Unlucky Saints "
11826,Southampton,"We actually showed some fight for once against top of the league team. Dibbling, tall Paul, Fernandez and even Adarma all looked good today. But as usual stupid mistakes have cost us. Still not convinced we are going to improve with RM and his constant passing out the back tactics though. "
11827,Southampton,"My thoughts after returning from the match: 

1 Scousers are insufferable twats

2 He nearly got the XI right. He even fixed the problem of Lallana by bringing Aribo on. I wish Sugawara had started over Fraser but that’s minor. The bigger problem was Downes who tried to be Franz Beckenbauer whilst in the back line. In the end playing out of the back too much got us. The first goal was simply daft. Alex McCarthy should not be instructed to do anything there except punt it! When the ball was awkwardly played back to Downes he had one job and that’s put it in row Z, not serve it up to Liverpool. 

3 Martin will be a good manager somewhere else where he has the players to play this style of attack attack football. I think he should go to Europe and find a club in a league where there’s balance. His top choice should be France where everybody outside of PSG are mostly playing in the same league. If not there then a smaller league like the Dutch, Portuguese, or Belgian league. He could play this way and not have the massive gap between a club like ours and a club like Liverpool. 

With today’s news of the daft sacking of Cooper by Leicester, we would be wise to approach him. However, these owners and wise don’t go together. "
11828,Southampton,"There’s no way he goes, but it’s obvious it’s just not going to happen under him. I do think they will get rid eventually but by the time they do it will be far too late to even imagine surviving.

I just hope the club as a whole seriously move on from this possession philosophy. It’s fucking wank to watch on top of being completely ineffective. Bring back the fast paced exciting football of Koeman and Pochettino, I’m bored out of my mind watching possession for possession’s sake. Koeman played out from the back and played possession football.. "
11829,Southampton,"My main thought after calming down a bit is that Dibling long term deal is the most important thing the club can do right now. Either he stays and helps us back up, or we get a big fee to help fire us up. 

Him, Tall Paul and Fernandes were excellent today. "
11830,Southampton,"Architects of our own downfall. Not a lot else to be said, good teams might get away with some of the ridiculousness we get up to. We almost did today! "
11831,Southampton,"Is it just me or has every goal we’ve scored this season been on the counter, or from a clearance - i.e. in spite of RM’s tactics? 

Would honestly love someone to correct me on this but I don’t think we’ve scored a single goal in the way RM wants us to. I believe so. At least the penalty Dibling drew was a turnover in midfield and a direct (and excellent) run to the box. Our goal was a fast counter from a Liverpool corner with a long ball (anti-Russ ball) from Dibling into Armstrong. Our goal vs Everton was on a counter too."
11832,Southampton,"Once again we scored 2 goals by going against Martin’s precious philosophy. Pass forwards, run at goal, shoot. It’s not rocket science for everyone apart from Martin.

Onauchu, a player Martin turned his nose up at because nobody over 6ft can play football, has a really good game.

First goal was gifted in comical fashion by the style of play he’s built his entire personality around. 

Stephens had another shocker but because he’s a mate of the manager it doesn’t matter. 

Do I give Martin credit for making it a close game? Yes. But it only happened because he partially compromised on the philosophy he promised he’d never compromise on. So well done Russ. "
11833,Southampton,"Thought we were much better today, more pragmatic and we will beat some teams worse than Liverpool if we can play like that. Still absolutely dogged by individual errors, poor passing for the first, Macca and our LB/LCB being in no man's land for the second and then whatever the fuck that was from Yuki for the third. Plenty of positives though, I still like us in the 5/3/2 3/5/2 shape, Tall Paul looked excellent, Dibbling, Fernandes good again, thought Downes was better and even Armstrong looked quite good. Even though the stats suggest they smashed us, this is actually the most positive I've felt about us so far this season. "
11834,Southampton,"[deleted] That's absolutely right. The players today have comprehensively proved the case for Martin's dismissal. There is enough in the squad to do much better. THB, KWP, Dibling, and Fernandes provide a foundation . Then there's Ramsdale to come back and I believe Archer has potential. Sugarrawa is decent  as well although he had a stinker when he came on today. Today also showed how effective we can be as a counter attacking side. But that was also in evidence last season and we haven't changed a hot. FFS get rid of Martin before he totally wipes out morale/confidence among the squad."
11835,Southampton,"Everyone here saying it’s not Martin’s fault it was individual mistakes… 🤦🏼‍♂️

Our players made the mistakes they did because they’re not good enough to play the way RM insists they do.

HOWEVER, what they have shown today is that we have the quality in the squad to have success at this level! But good things ONLY happened when we abandoned RM’s style and played forward and played fast instead.

This is COMPLETELY RM’s fault regardless of if the goals were ‘individual errors’. The errors will not stop because he’s asking players to do thinks they cannot do at this level.

Don’t get me started on Stephens being our club captain or Tall Paul being great despite being forced out by RM for a year (any chance ABK is the same anyone??)

RM out. Not sure McCarthy deciding to leave an open goal and Sugawara's handball has much to do with RM tbh 🤷🏻‍♂️

I'm Martin out, but we played alright today, our squad just isn't good enough"
11836,Southampton,"From my point of view we only lost today because of a couple of individual mistakes. I don’t think Martin was the issue this match. I can see why people think Martin is the issue but I don’t think replacing him with a different system would help us at all. Bang on, unfortunately this is why we signed Rambo, keeper let us down, gifted the goals. Yeah I was amazed to come here and see everyone saying ‘same old’.

Did we watch the same games as everyone else!?

We were defensively solid and limited them to basically zero chances. A stupid handball and two goalkeeping errors was all they had, outside of the missed Diaz shot. Same story different day though isn’t it. Martin has to play a style that suits his squad. This isn’t it. Everyone says we play well but we all know we will continue to cough up mistakes that lose the game every week Common denominator in our losses - Martin"
11837,Southampton,"For a while there, it was looking like u/infestationE15 could never watch us again. I can confirm I didn't watch any of it. Sorry guys, I tried my best."
11838,Southampton,"Steve cooper has just been sacked by Leicester who have 9 points. What’s our excuse? Their board have standards, ours are perfectly content with us losing every week."
11839,Southampton,Taxi for Martin I think. We looked good but everything we looked good because of were things he doesn’t want us to do. Time to go. 
11840,Southampton,Did anyone catch the words for the Tall Paul song? 
11841,Southampton,"If you take out three shocking and easily avoidable mistakes we win this game 2-0. Martin isn't to blame here, McCarthy cost us the game. It's bad enough that he threw the ball out in such a stupid fashion but to sprint off your line like that and neither get to the ball nor block such a shit effort from Salah is inexcusable. Martin can't teach shit players how not to be shit. "
11842,Southampton,"The Fuckses have fired Steve Cooper and they're doing the best outta all the promoted clubs this season. I don't even know what's going on anymore. They have higher expectations of their manager and players, clearly."
11843,Southampton,"This wasn’t an ‘unlucky defeat.’ We conceded from our build up play for about the 6th or 7th time this season. 

The players are taking extreme risks in those positions because they’ve been told so. "
11844,Southampton,get out of my club russell 
11845,Southampton,"Can we finally pull the trigger and get rid of Russell now?
The only reason we didn't lose by more is because Liverpool were shit today "
11846,Southampton,Martin out. 
11847,Southampton,"Stephen’s isn’t good enough. We signed like 5 CBs in the summer, time to try someone else. "
11848,Southampton,Really think some of the coaches need to teach basic fundamentals for playing from the back like don’t roll the ball to your teammate when 3 Liverpool players are encircling him.  There is a time to speed up the game but also know you can slow down the game by just delaying throwing the ball out a bit. 
11849,Southampton,"Amazed to come to the thread and see Russell Out.

We went toe to toe with the best team in the league and only lost because of ridiculously stupid individual mistakes.

His gameplan was spot on, we scored a quality goal and were in it till the end.

Not sure what people want. A manager who will win 5-0 again Liverpool? I agree, we were actually set up well for a change and the subs were good (except Sugawara but you can’t legislate for that as a manager). But people see what they want to see. His game plan is the reason we conceded all 3 goals, and going against it was the reason we scored. Yeah, I saw a pragmatic change of strategy (albeit with the suicide passes at the back retained much else was different and far more direct with less focus on possession and more on fast breaks). And I don’t know why people are so quick to decide all that was good was the players rather than the manager. 

I’m convinced neither players or manager are quite good enough but when it clicks they might be just good enough. I went to St Mary’s waiting for a four nil massacre by one of Europe’s best teams but ended up pleasantly surprised by how much fight I saw (and astonished to be frustrated that we didn’t nick a win). Our only goal came from open play was on a counter, and Martin sets up the team not to do that. I appreciate what he’s done but it’s time to move on to a manager that is more flexible. You could even argue that two of those goals could’ve been avoided if we weren’t so married to playing out of the back. You’re amazed that people want the manager out when we are rock bottom with 4 points from 12?"
11850,Southampton,same old story 
11851,Southampton,[deleted] Don’t get any ideas
11852,Southampton,Liverpool had just under four times shots as saints. Second half hardly got into Liverpool’s half.  There isn’t any creativity or goals in the team  doesn’t matter who is the manager they will face the same problem 
11853,Southampton,He’ll probably be out now and they’ll flog him in Jan 👍 That would be incredibly Saintsy
11854,Southampton,"He looked great, but most of his hold up play was deep in our own half with very few runners  going forward. That one piece of skill required him to beat 4 guys before there was a decent pass on "
11855,Southampton,"I live in London mate, think how I feel. Can’t move for Liverpool fans. Same mate. My flatmates from London too, classic Liv fan"
11856,Southampton,Yeah Macca all out of position there for the second goal. Still not happy that one long ball takes everyone out. Same as Everton but without the offside. 
11857,Southampton,"Koeman played out from the back and played possession football..  Not as focused as Martin but still you're correct. Koeman also had a much stronger squad that could get away with it. Yeah but with Tadic and mane running forwards. Not saying he’s shown he can score but Koeman would at least have someone like sulemana on the pitch to put the other team on the back foot when we break the press. No one is scared of Armstrong and Fraser’s physical prowess Koeman absolutely did not play anything like this. It was possession but always looking forwards and willing to take risks, Martin is completely risk averse. That’s the difference"
11858,Southampton,I believe so. At least the penalty Dibling drew was a turnover in midfield and a direct (and excellent) run to the box. Our goal was a fast counter from a Liverpool corner with a long ball (anti-Russ ball) from Dibling into Armstrong. Our goal vs Everton was on a counter too. 
11859,Southampton,"That's absolutely right. The players today have comprehensively proved the case for Martin's dismissal. There is enough in the squad to do much better.

11860,Southampton,"Not sure McCarthy deciding to leave an open goal and Sugawara's handball has much to do with RM tbh 🤷🏻‍♂️

I'm Martin out, but we played alright today, our squad just isn't good enough the second goal was possible because Downes played Salah onside, I'm not a McCarthy fan but to be fair to him there wasn't much he could do one on one against Salah, if he stayed on his line it would have been a goal 100%, he came out to close Salah down as he should, but salah is world class. I agree that mccarthy had a rush of blood on that goal 🤦🏼‍♂️ man is clueless. I was talking more generally though, most of the mistakes we’re making are down to style of play and personnel not being compatible. If we played a normal system, goal 1 doesn’t happen and lots of Liverpools chances don’t happen.

The suga one was clearly Stephens too though. Rather than heading it clear he just decided to have a wrestle and let the ball go over his head mean Suga had to do something."
11861,Southampton,"Bang on, unfortunately this is why we signed Rambo, keeper let us down, gifted the goals. "

11864,Southampton,Common denominator in our losses - Martin Common denominator in our losses - we lost the game.
11865,Southampton,"I can confirm I didn't watch any of it. Sorry guys, I tried my best. Do give the highlights a watch. I think we did ourselves proud. Apart from the standard errors that cost us the match of course!"

11869,Southampton,"His game plan is the reason we conceded all 3 goals, and going against it was the reason we scored. Martins gameplan caused McCarthy to come out when he shouldnt and the ball to bounce off Sugawaras chest?"

The worst attack in the prem against the tightest defence. Top and bottom of the table. And we were in the same game as Liverpool for the whole match.

I thought it was a foregone conclusion we were getting absolutely spannered but that squad did well against a far, far better squad.

Stephens needs to GTFO though. Absolute clown."
11873,Southampton,Don’t get any ideas This conversation was had at work watching the game with an LFC supporting colleague.
11874,Southampton,That would be incredibly Saintsy 
11875,Southampton,"Same mate. My flatmates from London too, classic Liv fan "
11876,Southampton,"Not as focused as Martin but still you're correct. Koeman also had a much stronger squad that could get away with it. Isn’t that management though? You play a system that your players can actually achieve to gain success…

We had the players to play it, we did and it was successful. Great. 

We don’t have the players now, but we’re still playing it and it’s obviously the reason we’re losing. Not great."
11877,Southampton,Yeah but with Tadic and mane running forwards. Not saying he’s shown he can score but Koeman would at least have someone like sulemana on the pitch to put the other team on the back foot when we break the press. No one is scared of Armstrong and Fraser’s physical prowess 
11878,Southampton,"Koeman absolutely did not play anything like this. It was possession but always looking forwards and willing to take risks, Martin is completely risk averse. That’s the difference It makes it all so funny that Puel got the boot for style of play over results.

If only there was some sort of perfect middle ground between the styles!

(I know that’s super oversimplified, Puel had a much better squad of course) The way we played today was literally identical to how Koeman set us up and played. I even wrote about it before. Downes dropping into cb and running more than anyone in the prem would make Ronald proud. 

Here is a little analysis of Koemans saints, it’s just a summary taking from an article I wrote about him at the time - https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsFC/comments/118bwz9/comment/j9h1ddj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button"

I agree Downes was at fault for his position but Mccarthy has absolutely no business being out there. If he advances to his 6 yard line and waits to react to Salah’s touch he at least has a chance to react to a shot or whatever happens but by going out there on that angle, he’s killed himself."

11881,Southampton,"We have a squad for this style, but no quality striker. Imagine if we had Delap I really don’t think we do. To play this style you have to get it right 10/10 times playing from the back in this league. Our players can do it maybe 6/10 times. They have the ability to do it, but not relentlessly and without error. Yes, we also need a striker which also indicates we don’t have the squad for this style. 
Every week we play “good football” that creates very little goal chances and allows 3+ mistakes that lead to goals. I can’t count how many times we get robbed while trying to play a ball down the middle to a player with his back to goal from our own box. 
Our goals today came from direct play, not short passing out from the back. Russ thinks breaking a press = goals or something, doesn’t realize there’s more to do after that Delap wouldn’t be scoring in this team as we wouldn’t be creating the chances"
11882,Southampton,Common denominator in our losses - we lost the game. Common denominator in our losses - we were winning.
11883,Southampton,Do give the highlights a watch. I think we did ourselves proud. Apart from the standard errors that cost us the match of course! 
11884,Southampton,"Martins gameplan caused McCarthy to come out when he shouldnt and the ball to bounce off Sugawaras chest? Both come from the space on our left, which is tactical.

I figured most of them would've lost trust already but we got Ramsdale, Stephens, THB, Dibling, Fernandes and looks like Tall Paul are all behind him.

11900,Southampton,"Exactly this, they are professionals after all, and I think most of them looking to showcase their best performance to get a transfer out at this stage. "
11901,Southampton,"Only 3 defenders? This is like when we had 5 strikers in the bench because we needed goals … I’m guessing KWP, THB, JS, as a 3, Fraser and someone else??? wing backs?? Fuck knows, only RussBalls genius mind can tell."
11902,Southampton,"It's brave to not play a left back against Salah 😂 Dont have him in my fpl while everyone else has him captained 😐 I think KWP is left back against Salah, and Fraser is right sided"
11903,Southampton,Suicide squad 
11904,Southampton,COME ON TALL PAUL!!!! He gets his first start against the best team in the league in a game where we are likely to have very few chances. If he plays badly that’ll be the end of him I think.
11905,Southampton,"Bree, manning and sugawara must be fuming! Not to mention Wood, Edwards, ABK, and Taylor who don’t even make the bench."
11906,Southampton,Fraser in the team again because he’s got good banter and is mates with the manager. Tbf no one is any good on the left
11907,Southampton,"Im guessing fraser is lb, at least I captained salah in fpl "
11908,Southampton,"Oh, so we’re just gonna accept defeat. Cool. "
11909,Southampton,"Downes dropping in to make a back 3? Or as a CB to make a back 4?

I'm confused There isn’t another CDM there, looks like it’s a 4-3-3 with Fraser at left back. We’re going to get absolutely battered"
11910,Southampton,Fraser in at L or R back against Liverpool is certainly a strategy. 
11911,Southampton,Fraser LB... Good lord. What did suga/bree/anyone else do to deserve this 
11912,Southampton,PUCKER UP EVERYONE THIS IS GONNA' BE A ROUGH ONE 
11913,Southampton,"Where's Taylor, Wood and Edwards? You'd think having at least one of the CBs on the bench would be a reasonable approach "
11914,Southampton,"No other centre backs on the bench either. Must be downes playing as a third cb cover with wing backs, 2 in midfield and 2 attackers either side of tall Paul. It'll be interesting to see how direct we're going to play. Bit pointless to trade possession with Liverpool so 2 defensive banks and hit on counter? But this is Russ Ball we're talking about 🤷 "
11915,Southampton,Downes was training with the back 4 hopefully he's not a fullback 
11916,Southampton,"Toon fan in peace, just wanted to know wth with that Fraser decision? It's so crazy I think it might just work lol good luck! "
11917,Southampton,Yikes 
11918,Southampton,All but confirming Edwards/Woods were brought in with on eye on slipping back into the championship next year 
11919,Southampton,"I’m guessing KWP, THB, JS, as a 3, Fraser and someone else??? wing backs?? Fuck knows, only RussBalls genius mind can tell. Will be a back 4. Fraser lb"

11921,Southampton,"I think KWP is left back against Salah, and Fraser is right sided "
11922,Southampton,"He gets his first start against the best team in the league in a game where we are likely to have very few chances. If he plays badly that’ll be the end of him I think. I don’t mind, how much fun has it been recently? tall Paul is a bit of fun, I can’t wait. No way he can ever be left out again after that first half. He’s been incredible entertainment. If we’re going to lose we might as well enjoy it."
11923,Southampton,"Not to mention Wood, Edwards, ABK, and Taylor who don’t even make the bench. "
11924,Southampton,Tbf no one is any good on the left Fraser could be right back
11925,Southampton,"There isn’t another CDM there, looks like it’s a 4-3-3 with Fraser at left back. We’re going to get absolutely battered Ah bloody hell"
11926,Southampton,Will be a back 4. Fraser lb 
11927,Southampton,"I don’t mind, how much fun has it been recently? tall Paul is a bit of fun, I can’t wait. You are so fun starved that seeing him lumber about shitting the bed seems like fun. Archer is a better option in every way"
11928,Southampton,No way he can ever be left out again after that first half. He’s been incredible entertainment. If we’re going to lose we might as well enjoy it. He’s been great this first half but I don’t trust Russ. I’d love it if Paul bagged a goal today
11929,Southampton,Fraser could be right back Then why play him ahead of Sugarawa or Bree?
11930,Southampton,Ah bloody hell 
11931,Southampton,"You are so fun starved that seeing him lumber about shitting the bed seems like fun. Archer is a better option in every way 
He’s stands at over 7 ft 3, Pauly, Pauly
He’ll save us in the premier league, Pauly, Pauly 
he lumbers about, he shits the bed 
He scores a goal, with his head 
Paul Onuachu, Southamptons goal machine"
11932,Southampton,He’s been great this first half but I don’t trust Russ. I’d love it if Paul bagged a goal today 
11933,Southampton,"Then why play him ahead of Sugarawa or Bree? Sugawara played two full games i think, plus long travel

Dont know why not Bree"
11934,Southampton,"
He’s stands at over 7 ft 3, Pauly, Pauly

Dont know why not Bree Oh yeah it’s all insane but it’s not like we’ve got loads of world class options anywhere. 

Martin be Martining."

11937,Southampton,"Oh yeah it’s all insane but it’s not like we’ve got loads of world class options anywhere.

11938,Southampton,Which one lol 
11939,Southampton,Start Tall Paul every match 
11940,Southampton,Mo you’re class mate but put your shirt back on we’re bottom 
11941,Southampton,Tall Paul going to pull us kicking and screaming to 17th 
11942,Southampton,As the founding member of the Paul Onuachu fan club can I just say a massive fucking told you  so to all the doubters 
11943,Southampton,Imagine removing your shirt for going up against the last place team. 
11944,Southampton,What a shite way to lose an otherwise decent game. Fuck maybe the lads can respond who knows. I think we all know
11945,Southampton,What an absolutely hilarious trio of goals to concede 
11946,Southampton,"I don't want to get too excited or jump to conclusions, but Tall Paul is the greatest player of all time. "
11947,Southampton,Onuachu is Brazilian and you can't tell me otherwise 
11948,Southampton,"Onuachu genuinely has the control of Messi, wtf "
11949,Southampton,tall pall has to start every match now 
11950,Southampton,"Shame that the goal we conceded was 100% all us, nothing to do with Liverpool (good finish though).

McCarthy has been fantastic outside of his passing so I feel bad for him. He needs to ignore Martin and just kick the fucking ball - whats he gonna do, sub on Lumley?

Big Paul clearly MOTM but Dibling once again providing the real Premier league quality though. He’s seriously shaping up to be our most expensive sale ever The goal you scored too was all Liverpools fault so it equals out 😂 we both fucked up for each of our goals I thought last year we adapted our build up from the back to allow McCarthy to be less under pressure when Baz got injured? Not sure why we're still trying to make him do something he can't do."
11951,Southampton,"McCarthy at fault for both goals, typical "
11952,Southampton,There’s a strong argument that we should’ve had four penalties today. 
11953,Southampton,Haha fucking hell I take it all back Paul 
11954,Southampton,Onuachu beating three with skill and strength and then laying off a no look pass got me feeling some type of way 
11955,Southampton,Tyler Dibling’s 20 year Ballon D’Or domination will bore fans 
11956,Southampton,Supporting this club is many things but at least it isn’t boring… 
11957,Southampton,"Jack with the selfish needless foul to finish it off. Chefs kiss. Yeah that bellend isn’t fit to wear the shirt, let alone the armband. Entertaining game otherwise, nice to only lose rather than get our arses handed to us."
11958,Southampton,"That ball in to the box at the end where Archer just missed it, we need to do that more often. The second goal was due to us breaking at pace we don’t do enough of that either. The possession based game is useless without actually trying to score. "
11959,Southampton,Armstrong and Fraser both down the left side is a disgusting sight 
11960,Southampton,Tall Paul's dazzling feet 
11961,Southampton,"Showing the pulling the shirt of Armstrong about 10 times on Norwegian tv... we had a penalty against us v Leicester for less... 
also, chest to hand shouldn’t be a penalty....
Lucky lucky Liverpool 
Unlucky Saints "
11962,Southampton,"Flynn Downes is a literal shadow of the player he was last season and is a key factor in our struggle this season. We pursued him so intently. We have no other options in his position, and yet we’ve still stuck him in out of position. He can’t pass it anymore, he doesn’t intercept, he doesn’t shield the back four. I don’t remember him making a tackle. "
11963,Southampton,Dibling has so clearly worked on his strength. Stamina has to be next as he is vital. 
11964,Southampton,Who would have thought that being direct might be an effective tactic? right? haven't we all been screaming since day 1 we HAVE to be direct if we had any chance to survive
11965,Southampton,"why why why why why why why why why why why why why why DO WE FUCKING INVITE PRESSURE AND CONSTANTLY PASS AROUND AT THE BACK Because for some reason our football philosophy is to stick with a manager whose style just barely worked against teams like Preston and Rotherham, and then applying that same style against teams like City, Liverpool and United and then having literally no plan B when it goes utterly tits up."
11966,Southampton,Jack Stephens is an absolute donkey 
11967,Southampton,Thumping it and penalties in training this week please Russ 
11968,Southampton,"Typical. Liverpool couldn't handle how tall the Paul was, so had to take him out. "
11969,Southampton,"3 balls, 3 donkeys, 3 gifted goals, 3 points Liverpool wouldn’t win without this help "
11970,Southampton,"just insanity

scoring 2 goals again at home and losing, not good enough "
11971,Southampton,Onuachu looking like Messi Not sure if it helps if the crowd coo at him like he’s a novelty
11972,Southampton,Even the at the worst moments a Hasenhüttl team played well till 70 mins 
11973,Southampton,onuachu has held the ball up unbelievably and we do this bullshit. 
11974,Southampton,think we’ve played quite well just gifted a goal Defensively we’ve been all at sea still and we’re not creating a whole lot but it’s certainly been better than previous games
11975,Southampton,"I can’t believe after nearly 18 months we’re still so naive with the ball around our own box. There’s a time and a place to mess around and the times when you have a 6’7 striker on the halfway line and 4 opposition players in or around your box is NOT the time

Other than that, I think we’ve been alright, they probably had a few too many shots and you’re almost waiting for one that’s a bit better, because it was all fairly routine for McCarthy "
11976,Southampton,"He played for 50 minutes, but it was the greatest 50 minutes of football I have ever seen. Godspeed Tall Paul you magnificent bastard. "
11977,Southampton,He’s taken his shirt off ffs 
11978,Southampton,It's insane how we lose games by individuals being idiots 
11979,Southampton,picking fraser is bad enough but maintaining this absolute bollocks against liverpool is just negligence. if he says bravery in the press conference or talking about limited chances then the reporters should just walk off and leave him to swim in his self loving pool of piss 
11980,Southampton,Just tuned in. Do I need glasses? That can’t be the score surely? 
11981,Southampton,The OAP has gone walkies again. Someone call the carers 
11982,Southampton,McCarthy doing Jekyll and hyde stuff If you don’t love that you don’t love Southampton football
11983,Southampton,"We need to talk about Flynn Downes... Ghost on the pitch. Needs to not be starting but then who else do we have One of the worst transfers we’ve made in recent years given the fee and his performances this season, and it’s a fucking high bar given some of the dross we’ve had come through"
11984,Southampton,VAR is a joke kelleher comes out misses the ball and wipes Armstrong how’s that not a pen Corrupt as fuck
11985,Southampton,DOWNES FOR FUCKS SAKE. Runs in a fucking circle and then loses the ball and gives away a foul again. It’s honestly incredible how he’s turned into this after last season Great championship player. Not quite good enough for this level.
11986,Southampton,"honestly, russell. change the system and adapt or get sacked. Martin will die on this hill. The problem is he’s so secure in his job"
11987,Southampton,"7 errors leading to goals this season is actually hilarious In 12 games, surely that has to be an all-time league record"
11988,Southampton,Thank fuck. We need to sort out our penalty takers 
11989,Southampton,I fucking knew he’d miss that. But well done Arma on the rebound 😄 
11990,Southampton,Six goals in SEVENTY SEVEN Premier League games just says it all. What the fuck is this club’s transfer policy 
11991,Southampton,Can’t believe we do all the hard work to equalise and then almost immediately gift them a goal 
11992,Southampton,"There’s a tall Paul song in the Northam but I can’t work out the words. the man deserves the world It’s hard to make out in the Northam too but I think it’s something like 

Viva Onuachu viva onuachu
Has a massive cock puts it in his sock viva onuachu 

Make of it what you will"
11993,Southampton,if we gift away the game with another silly goal it’ll be disappointing but unsurprising 
11994,Southampton,Shoutout Adarma somehow controlling that enough to lay it off 
11995,Southampton,Well that was a pen. Keeper doesn’t look like he touches it at all 
11996,Southampton,'who told him to come off his line bruv' - Maitland Niles 
11997,Southampton,"Alex McCarthy should literally retire now. 

Fucking Jamie Carragher is on commentary and I’m less annoyed about that than his existence in our squad "
11998,Southampton,"If you don’t know what schoolboy defending is, look at the Soton back line and keeper "
11999,Southampton,How sloppy is jack stephens jeez 
12000,Southampton,I hate this manager and the naïve idiots that gave him such a lucrative contract. It’s embarrassing. 
12001,Southampton,"Absolute dogshit, I’m sick to the back teeth of it happening every single fucking game "
12002,Southampton,Fucking pathetic way to concede after playing reasonably well so far. Fuck sake. 
12003,Southampton,"Same old shit, no doubt we’ll hear about bravery. This lot can fuck off, waste of my time.  
Pathetic club. "
12004,Southampton,"downes has been shite for the whole year

shows the gulf between the prem and the championship "
12005,Southampton,Shame you can't be booked for simulation in those circumstances. Needs a rule change 
12006,Southampton,Tall Paul is actually ridiculous lmao 
12007,Southampton,"The one bright spark in our fucking day and he’s being fucking stretchered off

fuck my life "
12008,Southampton,wtf do I know. Tyler Dibling and direct play is the answer to our season 
12009,Southampton,JUST when I think I have this team figured out and have nearly shut off emotionally they go and fire me RIGHT tf back up It's the hope that kills you!
12010,Southampton,Oh Macca. Fucking hell 
12011,Southampton,"Color me shocked, McCarthy screws us again. tbf Downes played Salah onside"
12012,Southampton,"No shock, we all know that this is who he is. Made some good saves in the first half but he is always, always, going to do some braindead shit like that. "
12013,Southampton,McCarthy man just retire and stop doing this to the fans 
12014,Southampton,God can we just forfeit this season? Can't watch this shit anymore 
12015,Southampton,Liverpool players just running into our players at full whack and the ref just been letting it happen all afternoon. Fucking annoying watching it happen every week 
12016,Southampton,It’s ok though because haven’t we been ever so brave. 
12017,Southampton,Cowardly from the VAR 
12018,Southampton,Onuachu actually has some nice ball control 
12019,Southampton,Fucking annoying watching these free kicks on the halfway line go right back to our 18 year box. Just maddeningly pointless. 
12020,Southampton,Fraser...he's got to be hooked at half time surely 
12021,Southampton,Thank fuck we've got this version of Macca today 
12022,Southampton,This needs to stop. Suicide. 
12023,Southampton,Incomprehensible and suicidal goal to concede. 
12024,Southampton,I can't stand this anymore. Downes has been bloody awful all season 
12025,Southampton,"After 10 mins of solid pressure, why the hell would we quickly roll it out to a midfielder with about 10 players in our own box. Be solid, ease pressure. It’s so simple "
12026,Southampton,"Huge, dibling what a player "
12027,Southampton,"this is why it’s so frustrating because we have some genuinely good players like dibling and fernandes, but just gift goals "
12028,Southampton,Dibling is so fucking special. Wow Enjoy him whilst you can because he sure as shit isn’t going to be here this time next year
12029,Southampton,It would be utterly vintage Saints if we somehow won this match 2-1. 
12030,Southampton,I’m not sure we have a stretcher big enough 
12031,Southampton,Dibling is better than Messi 
12032,Southampton,Lesley mate you were in why you stop running? and then immediately allow a stupid goal. 
12033,Southampton,"Both goals McCarthy’s fault, as good as his saves have been. "
12034,Southampton,We can only hold a lead if we score in the last minute of the game lol 
12035,Southampton,Oh my god Macca almost did it AGAINNNNN 
12036,Southampton,"Maybe I just don't know what the handball rule is but the ball hit his chest first then arm. Is that not a mitigating factor? It’s harsh definitely…wouldn’t have been given a few years ago It certainly was. Matthew Cash punched one off the line against us but it grazed his thigh first so VAR decided no pen Think it’s one of them ‘unilaterally larger’ rules

As in, if it hits your leg and your hand, but hand is close, no, otherwise yeah"
12037,Southampton,Don’t mind this formation/style but surely KWP LB and Suga RB is better than Fraser 
12038,Southampton,i’m sick of this arrogant charlatan of a manager 
12039,Southampton,"Today is the day, Onuachu winner "
12040,Southampton,"I don’t feel so good, Mr Stark. *""Think you're the only struggling club out there? I'm here to talk about the Relegation Initiative.""*"
12041,Southampton,"I'm not even going to watch. Every time I watch, something bad happens.

Genuinely, this season I've missed the first half against Ipswich, I missed the entire Everton game, and when I got home and turned on the Leicester game it was 2-0 :( We appreciate your service."
12042,Southampton,"First game in 3 seasons that I won't be able to watch or attend, so hopefully sod's law will mean that I miss a remarkable underdog win.

Jack Stephens masterclass incoming! "
12043,Southampton,"In this new multiverse we are living in where City are shit, we may pull off a shock.

We won’t. But I can dream. 🫠 "
12044,Southampton,What’s everyone doing today then to occupy themselves? I think I’m going to go running through a forest during storm Bert. 
12045,Southampton,(Chuckles) I’m in danger. 
12046,Southampton,dragging myself to st Mary’s this season has rarely felt good but the weather and wind make this a particularly hard sell it must be said 
12047,Southampton,I'm so glad my relaxing Sunday is going to be ruined. 
12048,Southampton,"Weirdly optimistic, the Premier League is a funny old thing, 20th beating 1st outta nowhere games do happen... Up The Saints! Yeah… according to Alfie House on the echo it’s happened four times in the premier league, with the last time Feb 2011 😅"
12049,Southampton,LWB Fraser….. 
12050,Southampton,"PAUL great to see you, how’s the weather up there. "
12051,Southampton,"*""Think you're the only struggling club out there? I'm here to talk about the Relegation Initiative.""* "
12052,Southampton,"We appreciate your service. I've even turned off notifications on the livescore app.

And I've triple captained Salah in FPL. I'm summoning all the good juju"
12053,Southampton,"Yeah… according to Alfie House on the echo it’s happened four times in the premier league, with the last time Feb 2011 😅 "
12054,Southampton,"I've even turned off notifications on the livescore app.

And I've triple captained Salah in FPL. I'm summoning all the good juju "
